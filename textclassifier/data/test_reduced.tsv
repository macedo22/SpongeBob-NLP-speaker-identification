Mr. Krabs	Carry on!  We'll never see that lubber again.
Mr. Krabs	All hands on deck! Get your anchors out of your pants!
Mr. Krabs	This is the end! Good-bye, Mr. Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Hip-hip!
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy, there, Krusty Krab. How could I help you?  Pizza?  Um... Of course we have pizza.
Mr. Krabs	Great idea! Take him with you.
Mr. Krabs	No.
Mr. Krabs	Don't mind if I do!
Mr. Krabs	What does yours say, Plankton?
Mr. Krabs	Why should I waste money lighting the whole store?
Mr. Krabs	Nothing, lad! Do you know what this is?!
Mr. Krabs	Get out! Everybody get out, you're spoiling me moment!  Me millionth dollar!
Mr. Krabs	Try again.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, Squidward, you got to lighten up.  Sure the lad's a bit overeager, but you've got to learn to roll with the punches, go with the flow. And don't bring anything on a boat that you ain't prepared to lose!  Me millionth dollar! (his pants rip off) SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob, you hooked me millionth dollar on the back swing! Reel it in before I keelhaul you!  Oh no. SpongeBob, quick, reel it in! Can't you hear the music? That's a 4/4 string ostinato in D minor! Every sailor knows that means death! Reel it in before it's too late! Hurry, SpongeBob! The music's getting faster!  There you are, ya stinkin' bilge rats. Stop playing that music! Stop it, please! I'm begging ya! Come on, honey, you can make it. Swim faster! Come to me, baby! Come on back! Hurry, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	You will? Great! Wait right here.  Here's where clam fishing gets serious!  Okay, you boys man the fishing poles and I'll keep me eyes peeled for Old Blue Lip.
Mr. Krabs	I trusted you, and you gave me this? I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this.
Mr. Krabs	Not a sandwich.  The sandwich.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, he'll come.
Mr. Krabs	Have you boys met...  ...me millionth dollar?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! What's wrong?
Mr. Krabs	But I'm still cool, right? Your old man is cool?
Mr. Krabs	Whoop, you're right!  Have a coral day, honey!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, how's about I join you kids?
Mr. Krabs	Hmmm, those youngsters are going out for a big night on the town.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, hadn't even crossed me mind. But, sure, I'll go!
Mr. Krabs	Great! Why don't you boys show up at my house at eight o'clock?
Mr. Krabs	I'm ready to party! Are you ready to par-
Mr. Krabs	Are you sure this is what the kids are driving these days?
Mr. Krabs	Cool. Gotcha.
Mr. Krabs	Debauchery!  Debauchery? I never thought of picking up trash under the highway as hot-blooded, but if it's what the kids are into...
Mr. Krabs	So, you wanna know if I can feel it?
Mr. Krabs	I'm feelin' like a total barnacle head!  You think this is cool?!  How about this!  And this? Am I with it now?  You guys wouldn't know a good time if it bit you in the end! I'm going home. You guys ain't cool. You're lame!
Mr. Krabs	The what?
Mr. Krabs	Well, count me in! If this works, I'll take back what I said about you two being lame!
Mr. Krabs	You finally came through for me, boys! I feel young again!
Mr. Krabs	But it was all SpongeBob and Patrick's idea!
Mr. Krabs	Good night, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	And tomorrow a customer will find it under his bun.
Mr. Krabs	Gone bad? That's nonsense. Bring it here, SpongeBob.  Uh, why is it in a cage?
Mr. Krabs	So I'm gonna be ok, doc?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no, it's the Flying Dutchman!
Mr. Krabs	Davy Jones' locker?! Why do I have to go there? I'm not a bad crab!
Mr. Krabs	Mommy!
Mr. Krabs	You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money,  touching money...  Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs.  Welcome all, welcome!  Hello, little one. What you got there?
Mr. Krabs	I was, son, I was. Free toys for everyone! And free refills!  Hello boy! Say, where's Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!  That's the old policy. Now run back and bring out a fresh one.
Mr. Krabs	Sure thing, Squidward. Take it easy.  Are you enjoying your in-meal movie?
Mr. Krabs	Credit card bills. Well, I knew this was coming. Let's see what the damage is.  Only ten thousand dollars. That's not so bad.  I'll just subtract it from today's profit.  And... there's no money in here.  How delightful.
Mr. Krabs	You mean... I'm awake?  No more refills!  Give me back them toys, you freeloaders!  Show's over, cheapskate!
Mr. Krabs	I'm not cheap, I'm generous!
Mr. Krabs	I'll take the money.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, what have I done?  I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook. I don't want this foul money.  I want SpongeBob back!
Mr. Krabs	You would have?
Mr. Krabs	The money!
Mr. Krabs	Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance.  Free to spend their money without any parental guidance whatsoever.  I guess that's what I like best.  Sure, I suppose some would try and take advantage of this situation by selling them toys or candy, but I sleep well at night with the knowledge that I'm providing them with something they need: a nutritious meal.  Come here, you little piggies!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob.  So weak and malnourished.  With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing.  Breaks me heart. [] No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Yes, Krabby Land!  Where a kid can have fun... for the right price.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, young man. What's your name?
Mr. Krabs	All right, here we go! I give you... Krabby Land! []
Mr. Krabs	He'll be here after I count their money. Just stall 'em.
Mr. Krabs	Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!
Mr. Krabs	Hey kids! Are you ready to meet Krabby the Clown?
Mr. Krabs	The children? I don't care about the children.  I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose.  Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest.
Mr. Krabs	Attention, all employees! Just a quick heads-up, boys. There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot!  This boot, to be exact. It's very stinky, and you'll have to wear it all day. See you in an hour.
Mr. Krabs	Jumpin' jellyfish! What's that stench?
Mr. Krabs	No.
Mr. Krabs	He used disguises!  Super science!  Civil disobedience!  And I always came out on top!
Mr. Krabs	I'll take this one.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I help you?
Mr. Krabs	Hm. I was sure it was one of Plankton's tricks. Well, at least his money's good.
Mr. Krabs	Well then, allow me to suggest your next move.
Mr. Krabs	What?!
Mr. Krabs	Uh-oh.  You'll never get away with it, Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	Plankton, wait. You can't look at the formula.
Mr. Krabs	Plankton! Wait!
Mr. Krabs	I warned ya.
Mr. Krabs	Of course not!  And Plankton will probably figure that out and be back again to find out what the real formula is. But don't worry, boys, the formula's safe from harm. I got it hidden in me most secret hiding place, a place no one, not even Plankton, would ever figure out.
Mr. Krabs	The Tattletale Strangler?  Go away, SpongeBob! Take your death cloud with you!
Mr. Krabs	Stay back, I'm well-armed!
Mr. Krabs	I gotta get out of here!
Mr. Krabs	No, spirits, please!
Mr. Krabs	So you two are the Bikini Bottom ghosts.
Mr. Krabs	Woo, now we wouldn't want that, would we? It's getting late now. You two pranksters better get going.
Mr. Krabs	Finished! At last.  What do you boys think of my masterpiece?
Mr. Krabs	As of now, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours!
Mr. Krabs	No one goes home!
Mr. Krabs	All right, you can sit down for five minutes. Then it's back to work.
Mr. Krabs	Good! We'll call you when it's ready, Mr. Lankton.
Mr. Krabs	Day 15! Give it up for day 15!
Mr. Krabs	Day...35...!
Mr. Krabs	Boy, I'm worried that...  Got it?
Mr. Krabs	There, there. I'm sure it's nothing that getting back to work won't solve. Here's your Spatular.
Mr. Krabs	Hmm, there may be a problem after all.
Mr. Krabs	"Well, I can safely say, ""No more 24 hour shifts"", because 23 hours will be plenty!"
Mr. Krabs	Hush boy, or you'll give away the location of me hidey-hole.
Mr. Krabs	Well, my navy buddies and I are having a reunion. And I wanted to wear me old uniform.
Mr. Krabs	By being the toughest of the tough!
Mr. Krabs	What do you mean?
Mr. Krabs	I still got it. Now be a good lad and go get your station in ship shape. And leave an old sea-dog to revel in his memories.
Mr. Krabs	It's true. I've molted.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, you're a genius.
Mr. Krabs	Alright, show me what you got.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, ok I get the point.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, what have I done?
Mr. Krabs	Uh-oh, this could be bad.
Mr. Krabs	Say something.
Mr. Krabs	Phone call for Mr. Krabs!   Get off the stage.
Mr. Krabs	No!! He's not Eugene Krabs. I am.  Alright lads, take a good look. This is who I am. I've molted me shell and I'm vulnerable.  But I'm certainly no bubble-blowing jellyfisher. No offense, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	You, too, Torpedo Belly?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, you made me drop me keys. Give me some space, lad. Can't a crab get a little space now?
Mr. Krabs	I am hurt, ya idiot!  I'm sorry I snapped at ya, laddie. It's just me back is killing me. It's me old, lumpy mattress. It's like trying to sleep on broken coral. I'm going out of me mind.  Oh, me back.
Mr. Krabs	So, where's me old mattress then?
Mr. Krabs	No!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I didn't recognize you. Say, why are you two dressed like meat?
Mr. Krabs	Wait! Hold up a second! Plankton, we don't need to drag this little incident into court, do we?
Mr. Krabs	What I really need is a good lawyer.
Mr. Krabs	Actually, SpongeBob, we won't be needing any testimony from you. Why, you'll be more of a...  of a liability than an asset.
Mr. Krabs	What? No. I didn't lay a claw on him.
Mr. Krabs	What are you doing here, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Pull yourself together, boy.
Mr. Krabs	Uhh...well...umm...No, I don't.  No, no! You don't understand! I had to make some tough business decisions and the sign seemed superfluous?
Mr. Krabs	What!
Mr. Krabs	You may as well give up on that case, me boy. My goose is cooked.
Mr. Krabs	Once again, Plankton, the sweetest of life's joys has eluded your grasp.
Mr. Krabs	Well, it'll do. After all, it's free!
Mr. Krabs	Aha! You just forgot to put your hat on.  Knew I'd figure it out.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! There's customers out there, boy, waiting to be fed!
Mr. Krabs	Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this: any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work.
Mr. Krabs	What? Guy in a suit? No, it's a tax collector!  Hide us, SpongeBob!  Now we'll walk nonchalantly to the rear exit.
Mr. Krabs	Only the greatest money maker since the Krabby Patty.  Gentlemen, meet .
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! In the machine!
Mr. Krabs	Need some change?  There ya are.
Mr. Krabs	Need some change?
Mr. Krabs	What the... No. It's payday, me boy. Here's your check, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	Okey-dokey, then. Carry on.
Mr. Krabs	What the?!
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy there, matey. Can I help you gentlemen with something?
Mr. Krabs	Sorry, it's just you're rich.  I'm Mr. Krabs. To what do I owe the honor of having you at the Krusty Krab, Howard?
Mr. Krabs	Do I still get the money?
Mr. Krabs	I'm free to do whatever I want. I can learn to ride that bicycle I got 30 years ago. Or go to the new hook museum downtown. Or even paint bowls of fruit. Aren't you happy for me?
Mr. Krabs	How's it going?
Mr. Krabs	Oh.
Mr. Krabs	Morning, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	I'm not your boss anymore. Just call me Eugene.
Mr. Krabs	That guy's a real pain in the hindquarters, eh Squiddy?
Mr. Krabs	What have you done to real Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	This is obscene.  Carl, I need to have a wor...
Mr. Krabs	See that, without all your smoke & mirrors, no one would stomach this garbage.
Mr. Krabs	I'll buy it for full price.
Mr. Krabs	Come in.
Mr. Krabs	This calls for drastic measures. I don't usually do this but you seem desperate. touch it.
Mr. Krabs	They wouldn't pay me.
Mr. Krabs	How much of my money do you want?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, sorry, Mommy. I can't lend you any money. SpongeBob accidentally swallowed me wallet.  Mommy, you got yourself a hat without my financial assistance.
Mr. Krabs	Boyfriend? Someone to spend money...I mean time with you? That's wonderful! Who is he? What's his name?
Mr. Krabs	Mommy?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! I don't know what sort of skullduggory you're up to, Plankton, and I'm not waiting to find out.
Mr. Krabs	I came to warn you, Plankton. Stay away from me mother. I know what you're really up to.
Mr. Krabs	Don't play stupid with me. Of course she does. It's an old Krabs family recipe. And you're not family!  I'm telling you for the last time: stay away from me mother.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, yeah...funny thing about that.
Mr. Krabs	Ah, that's it! No more hiding in my room like a scared little kid, it's time to act like a man!
Mr. Krabs	Great! I got cinema's newest star, right here.
Mr. Krabs	You are, Pearl. Mermaid Man wouldn't be anywhere without you. Go out there and break a leg.
Mr. Krabs	Two bucks?!
Mr. Krabs	How's about a free glass of water? A dozen free glasses of water! I'll even put ice in it!  No! Come back! Two dollars! Two dollars, no! No!
Mr. Krabs	Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Mr. Krabs	No! Come back! No! No! Urrgh... I gotta get SpongeBob back!
Mr. Krabs	But you're fine, me boy!  Ohh... uhh, well... maybe not.  All we need to do is get your confidence back. So, you can make me more money! I-I-I mean, patties.
Mr. Krabs	It is?
Mr. Krabs	And there's the pickles from last time too!
Mr. Krabs	Hip hip...
Mr. Krabs	Egad. What happened to ya? Uhh, I don't want to know. Just go do your jobs.
Mr. Krabs	Alright, that's it. I can't afford you jeopardizing me business. You two are more trouble than you're worth.  And don't come back until you get this problem sorted out.
Mr. Krabs	"I'm glad you asked, son. Remember when I went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel? I had a beautiful room. The employees were so friendly. They catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was. Because they lived by a code. And that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace: ""We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request"". Everything was perfect until I got the bill! They charged me for everything. $25 for a hamburger!  If they can charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much I could charge for a lousy Krabby Patty! And thus, the Krusty Towers was born."
Mr. Krabs	If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service.
Mr. Krabs	What's the matter? Afraid of a little manual labor?  I'm Squidward and I have to work for a living. Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
Mr. Krabs	He said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it.
Mr. Krabs	Hey! Hey, you can't take that elevator! You're an employee!
Mr. Krabs	I don't have to rent you a room!
Mr. Krabs	You've got to be kidding me!
Mr. Krabs	Now I get ya, boy. Alright, Squidward.  SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Well, how  your mother make 'em?
Mr. Krabs	Well?
Mr. Krabs	This room is exactly the same as when we started!
Mr. Krabs	Anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want?
Mr. Krabs	$15,000?!
Mr. Krabs	Neptune's trousers!
Mr. Krabs	None at all.
Mr. Krabs	Everybody brace for impact!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob?!
Mr. Krabs	Exactly.
Mr. Krabs	Hey...maybe I should have hired that ice sculptor.
Mr. Krabs	All their songs?
Mr. Krabs	Everybody get into position.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, even better sweetie. Hit it.
Mr. Krabs	I did? I mean...I did?
Mr. Krabs	Ah, nothing's too good for me daughter. Heh.
Mr. Krabs	Well, we better get back to work.
Mr. Krabs	This better be good.
Mr. Krabs	Well, what can it do?
Mr. Krabs	With that fancy machinery, I expect you to make Krabby Patties twice as fast.
Mr. Krabs	I always did like your old spatular. It got the job done every time.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah? Well that kid looks pretty shifty to me. How do I know he didn't steal it?  Hey! That little brat is throwing perfectly good money away! Oh, so if I can't have it, no one...  I hope he throws all your retirement money down a hole!  Poor little quarter. What the...? This well is full of money! Don't worry little fellas, I'll save you!  Oh, it's no use. Me poop deck's too big.
Mr. Krabs	You mean suckers throw in money down a hole for fun? That's the greatest scam ever.
Mr. Krabs	It's beautiful.  You smell that boys? That's the smell of money.
Mr. Krabs	To collect the money!
Mr. Krabs	Well, I could probably get a couple of bucks for Patrick. Nah. You better just hand up the money.
Mr. Krabs	Goodness, no. You gotta stay down there just in case any late-night wishers come by. I'll be back for ya at dawn.
Mr. Krabs	So how much money did you make last night?
Mr. Krabs	Just a coincidence.
Mr. Krabs	Well, where's your magic now?  Oh, where am I? What's going on here?  Uh-oh. I do believe in magic. I do believe in magic. I do believe in magic. Oh-no!!
Mr. Krabs	But what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my Krabby Patty recipe?
Mr. Krabs	You want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk?
Mr. Krabs	Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe. So keep your eyes peeled.
Mr. Krabs	Hmm, I know there's a microphone or camera in here somewhere.
Mr. Krabs	Let's party!  Ow! I won! It's time to boogie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Mr. Krabs	Wait a minute.  What the...?  Store shelves? Novelty toys? Lava lamps?  Useless knickknacks? Very convincing. But I'm still not buying it. You want a battle, Plankton? I'm gonna give you a war.
Mr. Krabs	Bubkes.
Mr. Krabs	Problem?! I don't have a problem! You're the one with the problem! Look at this. It means nothing. It's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front...  ...a sham, a snow job...  ...bologna with a side of flimflam and an order of Jive! See?! Who's the one with the problem?!
Mr. Krabs	I knew you'd come back.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, hey.
Mr. Krabs	Glad you could make it, buddy.
Mr. Krabs	That was truly amazing, Plank, old buddy. I guess I really can trust you 100%.
Mr. Krabs	Things are different now. Honestly. It would mean a lot to me.
Mr. Krabs	I never gave you the formula. I fooled you with an even more convoluted charade.
Mr. Krabs	Arrgh, alright, but it's coming out of your paycheck.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, that's SpongeBob all right.
Mr. Krabs	OWWW!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this...SpongeBob, take a vacation.
Mr. Krabs	Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work.
Mr. Krabs	Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here.
Mr. Krabs	Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?
Mr. Krabs	Well, boy...  off ya go! And don't come back 'til it's over.
Mr. Krabs	Now what?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  I've had enough for one day, son.
Mr. Krabs	Far out, little man. Far out.
Mr. Krabs	Why'd you do it, laddy?
Mr. Krabs	Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work.
Mr. Krabs	Well, take it off. The hair's getting into the patties.
Mr. Krabs	Well, if it means that much to ya, you can keep it. But you gotta wear a hairnet.  And if I see one more hairy patty, your wig goes in the dumpster.
Mr. Krabs	Well, stop wearing that nasty thing to work.
Mr. Krabs	Almost ready to open.  There.
Mr. Krabs	There be no such thing as opening too early, me boy. Excuse us, miss. Huh?  SpongeBob, who's your friend?
Mr. Krabs	That's Patricia, our newest Krusty Krab employee.
Mr. Krabs	This order goes to table 7 and remember your manners.
Mr. Krabs	Patricia, we may have only known each other for a short time, now, but I feel like a special connection has been made.
Mr. Krabs	So, let me get this straight, uh, you're not a woman?
Mr. Krabs	I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.
Mr. Krabs	Zip it, SquarePants... I'm talking to the rich guy.
Mr. Krabs	How about you pay the check, instead?
Mr. Krabs	Settle down, son. What are you all riled up about?
Mr. Krabs	That kid needs a vacation -- unpaid of course.
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy there, mateys. Motorcycle vehicles headed over the horizon.
Mr. Krabs	What the...why didn't that guy order a deliciously over-priced fountain beverage with his krabby patty?
Mr. Krabs	Refill? That's it. Listen up, everybody! New rule: No outside drinks. No exceptions!
Mr. Krabs	Let me see that.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no! Confound you, new KelpShake store. What's your secret?  Of course. Plankton, I bet he's behind this. A-ha! I knew you were behind this!
Mr. Krabs	Wow. I guess you're really not behind this after all. Plankton, they have... a secret formula.
Mr. Krabs	We've got to do something about this.  You sure this is going to work?
Mr. Krabs	I think we lost them. Well, you got any more bright ideas?
Mr. Krabs	Never mind that. What about SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	That's right. That's right. We have to fix the roof. It's, it's, it's leaking.
Mr. Krabs	Who you are calling a gorilla, you one-cent, one-eyed bottom-feeder!?
Mr. Krabs	Hi there. Uh, could I get one KelpShake?
Mr. Krabs	And to think this whole time I could've been selling these meself!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, I paid good money for this thing. Of course I'm gonna drink it.  What the...? I don't get what the big deal is. This tastes like a wet gym sock.
Mr. Krabs	Ah, phooey. You don't know what you're talking about.  KelpShake, KelpShake. Oh how I love a KelpShake.
Mr. Krabs	Hold it right there. You're not going anywhere...[He opens the safe] without a ten second head start.
Mr. Krabs	Reward? How much we talkin' about?
Mr. Krabs	Uh... Squidward, me cephalopod, I'm sorry to tell you this -- well not that sorry -- the customers prefer the new smaller Squidward to you. And so do I! 'Cause he's making me some bucks. So I'm changing your job to busboy, effective immediately.  Now pipe down and watch how it's done.
Mr. Krabs	It's okay, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	No.  It's about us!
Mr. Krabs	That wasn't in the budget!
Mr. Krabs	Hmmm, something ain't right.  For me?
Mr. Krabs	Attaboy, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Things were all peaches and creams.  Until we hit grade school.
Mr. Krabs	Then one day, as Plankton and I were plotting our revenge, I met the love of me life.
Mr. Krabs	I've got a pretty good idea, yeah.
Mr. Krabs	Two Stinky Burgers, please.
Mr. Krabs	We finally emerged the best-looking burger under the sea. We went back to Stinky's to rub our patty in those kid's greasy faces. But Stinky's had been shut down by order of the Health Department. So we seized the opportunity and converted our hideout into a restaurant.  Our adventure into capitalism began. One dollar, please.
Mr. Krabs	But what about satisfying the customer?
Mr. Krabs	"Which one? The one that says ""Eject"" or the one that says ""Trap Door""?"
Mr. Krabs	Don't know what you mean.
Mr. Krabs	Stop, you're gonna bust it.
Mr. Krabs	I'd know that theme song anywhere. It's Old Man Jenkins. Old Man Jenkins!
Mr. Krabs	Hey. that guy is like family to me.
Mr. Krabs	Well, that's ruined. But, no use letting this go to waste. These kids'll eat anything.  I've done it. I've discovered the perfect patty batter.
Mr. Krabs	Here ya are, sir. You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs	You were my only true friend that didn't have a president printed on him. But money doesn't hug back.
Mr. Krabs	Me, too. Me, too.
Mr. Krabs	Don't worry, Jim. No one could ever replace you. The original is still underneath.
Mr. Krabs	Aye, you always knew how to make me laugh. You just don't find employees like that anymore.
Mr. Krabs	It's a thing of beauty!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  That smells like a resignation letter.  SpongeBob's resignation? Oh, this is terrible! No one's making patties! And that mean I'm not making money!
Mr. Krabs	Anything for you, Jimmy, me boy. Cop a squat and lay your wreck and tell me what's on your wig, Jim.
Mr. Krabs	"A raise? That's not in my ""Hiptionary"". Help me get with it, Jack."
Mr. Krabs	You see, SpongeBob, you've got one quality Jim will never have: you're cheap!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, Squidward, have you seen SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Get a hold of yourself, boy.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, thats enough! We've got 15 orders to fill! Now go in the cooler and get some fresh patties.
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy, there, lads! Up a bit late to be playing pirate, aren't ye?  Wait! Don't shoot. Okay, okay, shoot me, but don't take me money!
Mr. Krabs	What's all the commotion about?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, stop it! You're tickling me, Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Now can I get you a Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs	Aye, and a great money maker ya are, too. Now, back to work!
Mr. Krabs	I was just gonna ask if someone can spy on Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to discover what Plankton's up to. Don't let him out of your sight. You'll need to rustle up some spy gadgets. If you don't accept it, you're fired! This patty will self-destruct in 10 seconds.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah? Yeah?
Mr. Krabs	You found out what Plankton's up to?
Mr. Krabs	I think I put off my cataract surgery too long.
Mr. Krabs	He's driving me customers away! All right, Plankton, you want my customers so badly?  You can have 'em!
Mr. Krabs	That's right!  I stole me own formula!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, yeah right. If I was you, I could steal me formula on me first try.
Mr. Krabs	Oh. You bet you, SpongeBob. Listen to this. Individual waste of the enus will substantially broaden the probability of multiple substantial visits, generating an inverse negative revenue margin of three quarters and one half of one percent: meaning if you call the customers by their names, they keep coming to spend more of their green back! So I want you two to learn the names of every customer.
Mr. Krabs	He's the ticket to your prize.
Mr. Krabs	Vacation? Who said anything about a vacation?
Mr. Krabs	Hey, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	Well, uh, don't do it again.
Mr. Krabs	And good night, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	How long you been here?
Mr. Krabs	Rent? Okay. Well, let's get ready for the customers. Start scrubbing the grill...
Mr. Krabs	Must be a full moon.  Mr. Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Oh! I have a disgusting clientele. Who spend their money freely.
Mr. Krabs	Oh... Okay, but I'll have to raise your rent.
Mr. Krabs	Argh.  That boy's taking the manliness out of me restaurant. Oh, he didn't. Floral print curtains in me office? That's it. That's the last straw! I'm not putting up with this any longer.
Mr. Krabs	Me customers!  Gone! Gone! Gone! All they wanted... was to give me...their money!  SPONGEBOB! Pack your bags, boy. You're moving out.
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward, you're always going on about your book club. Read this.
Mr. Krabs	It means that he's a big fat cry baby
Mr. Krabs	All right, quit clowning around and get to work.
Mr. Krabs	Quit your lollygagging and get a move on.
Mr. Krabs	This is fantastic. The local hockey team is paying me to practice here.
Mr. Krabs	The thermostat.
Mr. Krabs	It looks more like Plankton trying to steal me restaurant.
Mr. Krabs	You don't really think I'd leave me secret formula behind when I go on vacation. do you?
Mr. Krabs	And the computer?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! Where the barnacles is our fry cook? He's been gone all day. That boy's never been a work shirker. We got a crowd of hungry customers waiting.
Mr. Krabs	A dinner date? Well, blow me down, boy. I didn't know you had it in you. so when do we get to meet the little lady?  By the way, is she rich?
Mr. Krabs	Your date's a Krabby Patty? Me thinks the boy's really lost it.
Mr. Krabs	What was that? I couldn't hear you.
Mr. Krabs	Krabby Patties are meant to be loved and eaten. That's what they're put in the ocean for. And it looks like yours is way past due.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, all right. Presents for me darling little sardine. It's from me.
Mr. Krabs	But I got them for a bargain!  Oh, what am I gonna do? I spent two whole dollars on these boots and now I'm stuck with them!
Mr. Krabs	Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition. And these boots were given to me by the most famous fry cook in the sea.
Mr. Krabs	Paycheck! You got a deal--
Mr. Krabs	Hold on there, lad! You're gonna give me a heart attack!  You got yourself a deal.
Mr. Krabs	What's wrong, Mr. Squid-ard?
Mr. Krabs	I... uhh, I see you're still wearing them boots.
Mr. Krabs	I gotta go to my office!  I can still hear it!  It's still coming through! The infernal squeak!  Those boots have got to go! And I need an aspirin.
Mr. Krabs	It's okay, son.
Mr. Krabs	Poor lad.
Mr. Krabs	What did you say?
Mr. Krabs	Huh?  Huh?  I didn't write that!
Mr. Krabs	I do, son.  Here's the paycheck I owe you.  Plus a bonus!  Well, there's your paycheck anyway.  I need a vacation.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward!  Stop distracting SpongeBob and serve the customers!
Mr. Krabs	Listen up. Me customers come here for cheap food and verbal abuse, and if you can't get it right, get back in the kitchen with SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	He is now. Give him an apron and put him to work. You know, he might be as good a fry cook as you.
Mr. Krabs	A smiley face with dimples?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what's the problem?
Mr. Krabs	Don't go goofy on me, boy. Money can't really talk. Only fish can talk.
Mr. Krabs	If I could talk to money, and it could talk to me. We'd always be the best of friends, for all eternity.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, yeah, my immortal soul. I've heard that speech before.
Mr. Krabs	Who said that?
Mr. Krabs	It worked! I can talk to money. Oh...
Mr. Krabs	You're coming home with me.
Mr. Krabs	Now that we're alone, let's tell each other secrets.
Mr. Krabs	Ok, so how can I make you happy?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, wait a minute. I am not spending you on corn dogs, diapers, or fairy princess outfits.
Mr. Krabs	Ah, you're all shallow and self-absorbed. What did I ever see in you?
Mr. Krabs	Take this bag as far away as possible and bury it.  What have I done?  Give me that back.
Mr. Krabs	To those guys.
Mr. Krabs	But how are the patties? I mean, how do they taste?
Mr. Krabs	Ready, set, go...!
Mr. Krabs	Why hello. You're the television food critic Gene Scallop, aren't you? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Eugene Krabs, owner and proprietor of this fine...
Mr. Krabs	Turn it up, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Okay, a little lower, lower that's perfect.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, what's going on over here?
Mr. Krabs	They're our new Krusty Sponge napkins! Extra absorbent.
Mr. Krabs	I got it right here. Here you go, Squidward.  You're on grill duty now.
Mr. Krabs	No.
Mr. Krabs	My pleasure.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, you're going to love this. Spongy Patties.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, you're right! All this instant success must be scrambling my brains! We'll make them $2.98.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob  Great Neptune's mother's stockings! Zombies they're here to eat me money.
Mr. Krabs	No, your honor.
Mr. Krabs	It's good to have you back, boy. Let's see how Squidward's enjoying his new position.  Take him around as many times as you like.
Mr. Krabs	Time to pack it in, Sponge- Bah! Wha?!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, and, uh, lock up when you're done.
Mr. Krabs	Spontaneous molecular distortion, hmm? I guess I better go see what the lad's up to.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, this time you've done it, boy. What've you got to say for yourself?
Mr. Krabs	I'll take that.
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, a penny.  A trail of pennies!
Mr. Krabs	I can't tolerate your stinky gas!
Mr. Krabs	He's got the Krabby Patty! Catch him!
Mr. Krabs	That's it! Knit, little nitwit!
Mr. Krabs	Here, use this!
Mr. Krabs	We need to get you thinking about work.
Mr. Krabs	Ah, quit your blubbering and have a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs	You got three seconds to get out of me restaurant before I kick you out! Fine, have it your way!
Mr. Krabs	Oh. Uh, yeah. Well, you'll be shipped off to some other restaurant somewhere far away from here! Uh details are kinda hazy, but I packed your bags and your bus leaves in five minutes!  Heh, looks like it's early.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, Squidward, look at this!  We're charging 52 smackeroos for this little guy.
Mr. Krabs	Shredded...  gold?  Couldn't we use less expensive ingredients?
Mr. Krabs	No, those aren't burglars, Pearl. Those are just friendly repo men.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, Mr. Le Schnook... I lost everything! I'm bankrupt! You and your fancy eats are all I got left now.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I can still hear his sweet little voice.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob me boy. You came back! And you brought customers!
Mr. Krabs	Oo...uh...beautiful day for standing outside a museum doin' nothin'.
Mr. Krabs	Enjoy the artifacts!  Don't stand in one place too long, people might mistake you for one.  SpongeBob!  Hew, that was a close one.
Mr. Krabs	Money!
Mr. Krabs	Quite a vessel, but who's manning it?
Mr. Krabs	Huh?
Mr. Krabs	What a ripoff! This street ain't gold!
Mr. Krabs	Comin' through, boys!
Mr. Krabs	I'd know that smell anywhere. Me pockets. They'd be smelling loot.
Mr. Krabs	I'm alright, sonny! Industrial accidents can make quite a mess. Unless you fall into a money press. Oh, make me into money, Mr. wonderful machine, I always knew that me true color was green! Oh, ever since I was a little kid, I dreamed of such a place, yes I did! With mountains of money, and rivers of cash. And a pool of coins to make a splash! Oh, I'll open up a Krusty Krab with patties made of money. They'd be delicious, and expensive, and taste like golden honey! Money and gold and treasure untold! And all of it for me!
Mr. Krabs	Never mind! Just keep doing what you're doing!
Mr. Krabs	There's no place like Atlantis!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, he needs one, eh?  Methinks a paying customer's in our midst.  Patrick, how's a Krabby Patty with extra cheese sound?
Mr. Krabs	My good man, how you doing?  Excellent. Now, let's get down to business.
Mr. Krabs	Non-paying customer!
Mr. Krabs	See these ice cube trays?  I want you to put 'em in that bucket.
Mr. Krabs	You've destroyed me refrigerator.  You've destroyed many of the things I love.  I got another job that even a nimrod like you couldn't mess up.  Alls you got to do is throw all of these trash bags down the trash chute, like so.  See?
Mr. Krabs	Well, well, let's see how the poor boy's doing. Well, did you earn me money back yet, Patrick?
Mr. Krabs	Gotta hand it to ya, boy.  Gettin' Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy to shoot for me restaurant was a stroke of genius.
Mr. Krabs	Back, you! Back!
Mr. Krabs	Every time!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, come on, Squidward. Can't you just pretend to listen for once in your life? Do it for old Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs	That's it! We'll take the Krusty Krab on the road.  So long, boys. Make me lots of money!
Mr. Krabs	You let go of all the money I earned as ballast?
Mr. Krabs	He's already 10 seconds late! I'm docking him a month's pay for this.
Mr. Krabs	I'm fine, as long as me money's OK.
Mr. Krabs	Don't talk back to your superior officer, you...
Mr. Krabs	All right, all right, group meeting. Everybody out! The Krusty Krab's closed until further notice!  Now...  how do you propose we find me money-making employee?
Mr. Krabs	If you don't find him, you'll be out of a job forever.
Mr. Krabs	Don't recognize the Krusty Krab? Stop your kidding, boy. And start frying up them patties.
Mr. Krabs	We're really sorry we ran you out of town, boy. But we're glad you're back.
Mr. Krabs	And I'll even throw in a free soft drink for an extra $3.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! Where you been, customers are blowin' in here like nobody's business!
Mr. Krabs	Hello, and welcome one, and all your money to ye olde Krusty Krabbie!
Mr. Krabs	'Course ya did, because you're about to find out. SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Ah, it don't matter anyway, lad.  She can't close us down.
Mr. Krabs	It's no use!  I'm ruined!
Mr. Krabs	You know, lad, I can remember a time when people used to knock before entering someone else's home!
Mr. Krabs	Okay, thanks. I'm gonna see what SpongeBob's doing.  Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob?  SpongeBob? What are you doing under the table?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, Ms. Gristlepuss! I'm sorry we sold Krabby Patties. But do you really have to send us to jail?
Mr. Krabs	Well, is he!
Mr. Krabs	You're on probation, boy!
Mr. Krabs	Yes, yes. The one I hired entirely on your recommendation. Hurry up, boy.
Mr. Krabs	I even turned down my three adorable nephews.
Mr. Krabs	Wait a minute...I know the perfect job for you!
Mr. Krabs	I didn't think so. Ooh wait, I almost forgot me coupons!  There's a couple double ones in there too.
Mr. Krabs	Come to papa! Come to papa!  Yay! Two nickels.  Hey, that's SpongeBob out there!  What in blue blazes is that boy up to?  Well I'll be a geriatric jellyfish! SpongeBob found a penny! A bright shiny penny just sitting there, and he picked it right up! Huh, I can remember the whole thing as if it just happened a moment ago.
Mr. Krabs	Interesting how things work out that way. Some folks just walk along and stumble over free money, while others, others, they work!
Mr. Krabs	Really?
Mr. Krabs	Wha.. What?
Mr. Krabs	But did you check all your pockets?
Mr. Krabs	Shirt pockets?
Mr. Krabs	Hey, maybe it fell in your sock.
Mr. Krabs	So, uhh, no penny, huh?
Mr. Krabs	Yes I did.
Mr. Krabs	by a... by a plucky young sponge.
Mr. Krabs	No, wait. Noooooooo!
Mr. Krabs	Hello, and welcome to a very important evening. Tonight's event is entitled: Pennies, for the penny-less. And before the following images are shown, I would ask each of you to look not look with your eyes, but with your heart.  Three dimes, two nickels, one quarter, zero pennies. And since I realize the images seen here tonight may be wretchedly hideous, I am going to tell you what you can do to end this travesty: You can donate one penny to me: Mr. Krabs. Also known as: Mr. Krabs, the man who doesn't have one.
Mr. Krabs	Hiding it, somewhere. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it.
Mr. Krabs	Hiding it, inside,  in there, somewhere.
Mr. Krabs	Ah ha ha ha ha hooooooooo hoo. I fell so relieved. There was no penny after all! Well, I'll be going now, You can keep the metal detector, SpongeBob. See ya!
Mr. Krabs	There's gonna be some changes around here.  A customer! Welcome to the Krusty Krab!  SpongeBob, cater to his every whim. And don't screw this one up.
Mr. Krabs	The money?
Mr. Krabs	Hooray! My little girl is finally a star.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward!  This show is a disaster! You're ruining me!
Mr. Krabs	I'll be needing another wheelbarrow for next week's show!
Mr. Krabs	Man alive!  He's taking us down!
Mr. Krabs	That lower life form can slender my name, and desecrate me mother's grave,
Mr. Krabs	Exactly!
Mr. Krabs	But of course, my good customer. That'll be ten dollars.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what are you doing sitting around? We need Krabby Patties out there.
Mr. Krabs	Wait, where're you going?  SpongeBob! What are you doing back here? Do you expect the customers to eat this? And now, thanks to you, they're leaving in boat loads.
Mr. Krabs	Sheesh. Calm down, boy.
Mr. Krabs	Uhh... yeah well... we kinda milked it a little.
Mr. Krabs	I suppose you can have the honor today, lad.
Mr. Krabs	Behind your back?
Mr. Krabs	Have you always had three legs?
Mr. Krabs	"Yeah, what do ya think ""compersation"" stands for?"
Mr. Krabs	Well, Plankton finally got what he deserved.
Mr. Krabs	Arr, mutiny!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, may I speak to you in private.  You won't mind if I set this here, will you?
Mr. Krabs	Uhh... suit yourself.
Mr. Krabs	He's deceiving ya! Reach into his pocket now and take what he's got!  You too, boy!
Mr. Krabs	There ya are!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, that new honker of his has turned him into a complete jerk!
Mr. Krabs	Ata' boy! Now for the moment of truth!
Mr. Krabs	That said fact aside, midway through today's lunch rush, we ran out of, the secret ingredient  to the secret formula!
Mr. Krabs	Wait!
Mr. Krabs	Hop to it! There's a lot of hungry customers out there!
Mr. Krabs	That would be... you, SpongeBob! You stole me secret ingredient!
Mr. Krabs	Uh, what are you talking about, SpongeBob? I'm not holding any secret ingredient.
Mr. Krabs	It's simple, $1.99 is a lot to pay for the secret ingredient every time I get a delivery, so I s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s... took it to avoid paying, you know.
Mr. Krabs	Give away me Patties for free? Oh no, I couldn't bear the sight of that.
Mr. Krabs	You're really funny man! You think you can compete with me? Look Plankton, look at all these loyal customers. Loyal to me, not to you!
Mr. Krabs	Why go to the Chum Bucket, when the Krusty Krab is adding tasty Chum to our menu?
Mr. Krabs	Well, what do you think?
Mr. Krabs	Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing. You see, crabs are not born with an innate inkling of irony.
Mr. Krabs	What? And miss this? I've never enjoyed me self more! This irony is pretty good stuff.
Mr. Krabs	WHAT? What do you mean none? Don't these people read the paper?  Oooh, this thing hasn't been touched in months.  While that paper's selling like Krabby Patties. Uh, pardon me, sir. Could I interest you in a copy of the Examiner, this fine day?
Mr. Krabs	No, thank you.  Now let's see how much they charge for advertising.  25 PER WORD! The newspaper business sure is easy money!  That gives me an idea!
Mr. Krabs	What a money-tastical day! Eh, Mr. Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	: Too boring?    What's the meaning of this?
Mr. Krabs	: Don't think of it as lying, boy. Think of it as... uh... a practical joke. You know. Something everybody can have a good laugh about. The public expects a little embellishment here and there, so I want you to go out there, and get me a lead story that'll sell!
Mr. Krabs	: Thanks for your business, and here's your paper.
Mr. Krabs	: Ah, you just don't get it, do you boy? We're not hurting anyone. We're just making their lives interesting, for everybody else.  Now get out there, and fetch another story!
Mr. Krabs	: Don't be silly, boy! We're a success!
Mr. Krabs	: You've really outdone yourself this time!
Mr. Krabs	: Surprise me! Give me a shocker!  Good night boy. I'll check on you tomorrow morning. And remember, the wildest story ever!
Mr. Krabs	: What's going on?
Mr. Krabs	How can I be okay when me money's gone?! All gone!  It just goes to show, trying to make an easy buck doesn't pay.  Or does it?  Get me some scissors, boy-o! It's time to use  imagination!
Mr. Krabs	You make Corn Crunch come out me nose!
Mr. Krabs	Good night, sweetie.
Mr. Krabs	OK, you could have your allowance early.
Mr. Krabs	Just putting up the house rules.
Mr. Krabs	Open this door or Ill...
Mr. Krabs	Is that what girls do at slumber parties?
Mr. Krabs	Look what theyre doing to that mans house!
Mr. Krabs	Isaidturn it off!
Mr. Krabs	Ooh look, thisll be fun to destroy!  Whee!  Now do you get it, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Who the heck is that?
Mr. Krabs	Right, boy!
Mr. Krabs	I know, son.
Mr. Krabs	What in Neptunes toupee is going on here?  Me knick-knacks!  Me root beer!  Me pile of old newspapers!  I was maybe gonna read that someday!  I knew I shouldnt have trusted you!
Mr. Krabs	Nooo!
Mr. Krabs	Were you talking to me, Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Melted off?
Mr. Krabs	That reminds me. Where are all me customers?
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy there!
Mr. Krabs	Yes! Today, they're only three dollars! Each.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, show him the menu.
Mr. Krabs	Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Wha? Where'd the beach go? These waters are calm. Too calm.  Dark sky.  Water spouts.... of blood.  Jelly donuts falling from the sky. What could this mean? There's only one logical answer. I've landed right in the middle of Dutchman's Triangle. Right above Davy Jones' Locker. In the Devil's Galley.
Mr. Krabs	Well, there ain't no use crying over it.  Yah! Don't worry, Cashy! Ill protect ye!
Mr. Krabs	Please! Please, Mr. Dutchman! Let Cashy go! I promise I'll never soil your waters again!
Mr. Krabs	How do you know?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, all alone again.  Cashy!
Mr. Krabs	And Cashy!  CASHY!!
Mr. Krabs	We dont want any trouble, now just keep moving.
Mr. Krabs	Dont be late for work tomorrow, boy.
Mr. Krabs	Free?! Gimme, gimme, gimme!  Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!  Gimme. Gimme. Gimme?  Uhh... what do I get?
Mr. Krabs	Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money! Money, money...   Money... money... money.  Money?
Mr. Krabs	Now go get them!
Mr. Krabs	Don't we all?
Mr. Krabs	The Krusty Krushers. Now go out there and wrestle me up a million dollars!
Mr. Krabs	That's the million dollar winning spirit.
Mr. Krabs	Okay, but you still have to try to win in fake wrestling.
Mr. Krabs	Get up! Get up, you guys!
Mr. Krabs	Goodbye, money.
Mr. Krabs	Or?
Mr. Krabs	Huh?  Oh. Ahoy, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	I sure am.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, this promotion is designed to save US money. Now, don't forget. Each participating patron who purchases any drink in our new Krusty Krab Viking Size cup gets to a chance to try on this genuine cardboard Viking helmet.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, well, uh... the Vikings lived a long time ago.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, I'm expecting a fifty cent rebate check. Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie.
Mr. Krabs	So I bought me a ship, hired a crew.....
Mr. Krabs	For all he knows, the Krusty Krab is a pirate ship. If he were to find out the truth, it would break his salty, barnacle encrusted heart. Boo-hoo!
Mr. Krabs	All right, me hearties! Get this one thing clear. If Grandpa Redbeard is ever gonna believe I'm a pirate, ye landlubbers are gonna have to pass as a pirate crew. Which means, I want you to look like a pirate.  I want you to talk like a pirate.
Mr. Krabs	He's comin'!
Mr. Krabs	Oh.
Mr. Krabs	"I better take the helm and guide us to safer waters. Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there, eh, Granddad? I said, ""Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there!"""
Mr. Krabs	Not to worry, Granddad.
Mr. Krabs	Clear!
Mr. Krabs	Oh no. If Granddad sees something, it must be the real deal.
Mr. Krabs	Go get it, Granddad.
Mr. Krabs	Nooooo!
Mr. Krabs	Don't worry! I have it under control!
Mr. Krabs	I bet you're wondering about that.
Mr. Krabs	Now, Granddad. There's a simple explanation.
Mr. Krabs	You see, Granddad? I'm no pirate. I'm just a lowly restaurant owner! I'm sorry I failed ye.
Mr. Krabs	I knew I got me talent from someone!
Mr. Krabs	Well... it's almost quittin' time, Squidward. You... got any big plans for after work? .
Mr. Krabs	Oh boy.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, so?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead.
Mr. Krabs	Babies?
Mr. Krabs	Hey there, little critters.  Come to...
Mr. Krabs	Well, it's like they always say back in the old country, lad.
Mr. Krabs	Battle stations men!!! Here he comes!
Mr. Krabs	Everybody has a secret, SpongeBob, and mine's gonna take 15 minutes.  Maybe 20 if she can spruce up my cubicles.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, sure, why not?  You okay, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Me customers cowering in fear?
Mr. Krabs	All my secrets...?  So, is there anything else I can do for you, acting manager SpongeBob?  Ah, Gwenevere!!!
Mr. Krabs	I've got a special assignment for you. This is a build-it-yourself telescope. The only problem is, I can't figure out how to put the darn thing together. That's where you come in.
Mr. Krabs	"Excellent! Because I was looking at your annual employee report card... ...and it appears the ""Does Laborious Task for Supervisor"" box is unchecked. See ya tonight!"
Mr. Krabs	Or you could sit there and watch me fill out your employee report card...
Mr. Krabs	Boy? Hold on, boy, you're supposed to be using that motorized hex drill! Now, where is it?
Mr. Krabs	Hey, SpongeBob was supposed to bring that to me!
Mr. Krabs	How would you like a job, Patrick?
Mr. Krabs	You're buddy Patrick. I hired him to stand out there and hold that sign.
Mr. Krabs	That ain't the kind of attention we need! Why don't you show a little razzle-dazzle, maybe give the sign a little twirl or something.  Just keep workin' on that one, eh boy? Listen, if any tourists come by, why don't you blow them away with a little extra twirl.
Mr. Krabs	Ehhh... what the heck. It pays to advertise.
Mr. Krabs	Five dollars please. Alright.
Mr. Krabs	What the barnacles is going on out here?
Mr. Krabs	A bloody nose, eh? Do ya think I was born yesterday? He doesn't even have a nose. Now everybody, get back to work! I'm Not Running A Happy Factory Here  keep up the good work, Patrick!
Mr. Krabs	Well, what if he fell from two boxes...?  ...into cream pie?
Mr. Krabs	It's OK, boy, he signed a waiver.  Is he ready, Mr Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Come on, Patrick! We've got a perfectly good bucket of spiny sea urchins down here!
Mr. Krabs	Well you'd better figure it out. These people paid good money for a floor show full of pain and humiliation. Now make with the cods-wallop, pal, understand?
Mr. Krabs	Thank you.
Mr. Krabs	Hey boy, what's with all that snivelin'?
Mr. Krabs	Well, I'd be honored to help you and your snivelin' snail during such desperate times. I love helping others. Like helping meself Now, how much ya got?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob me boy, I need to borrow a blanket.
Mr. Krabs	"The Chum Bucket?  ""Chum...is...Fum?"" SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs	No.
Mr. Krabs	I thought you'd say that.  So we need to infiltrate the Chum Bucket and steal the formular back.
Mr. Krabs	We made it SpongeBob. We're in!
Mr. Krabs	No, uh  I'm full thanks!
Mr. Krabs	Yep.  Keep up the good work boy'o!
Mr. Krabs	No, no baby, no more crying. We'll get you a date. Why, uhh... I'll take you!  Well, what about Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, they would. We've got to find someone else. Listen up! Which one of you lucky lubbers wants to take me lovely daughter Pearl to the prom?
Mr. Krabs	Hello?  What do you think Pearl? Cleans up pretty well, doesn't he?
Mr. Krabs	Good job, laddie.
Mr. Krabs	No. It's a holographic projection of The Krusty Krab. I want you two to watch all the entrances.
Mr. Krabs	Don't make me have a flashback.
Mr. Krabs	Plankton doesn't stand a chance.
Mr. Krabs	Now to add some special anniversary deals to the menu.  Krabby Patty... 20 bucks. 39 bucks. 30.  Oh, number zero, how I love you so.  SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	What? But you are.
Mr. Krabs	Well, you want want to do it, then?
Mr. Krabs	Decorations, check. Security?
Mr. Krabs	So, let's get out there and sell some Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs	The door!
Mr. Krabs	No,  the air duct.  This way boys.  All we have to do is head through this duct.
Mr. Krabs	Oh. All right,  then, let's try this one.
Mr. Krabs	Back then, Krabby Patties only cost a dime.  It was a dark and  evil time.  I still have nightmares.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, uh... uh... uh...  I just want to make sure you all floss after ever meal.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, you've been working here for a while now, so I think I can trust you. It's time I told you.
Mr. Krabs	What's that?
Mr. Krabs	What's the sound? Customers!
Mr. Krabs	What?
Mr. Krabs	Come back with me money!
Mr. Krabs	I didn't make any money.
Mr. Krabs	Ow!
Mr. Krabs	Money!
Mr. Krabs	It's launchin' time.
Mr. Krabs	Wow, that's some coincidence 'cause I just lost one earlier today with 50 bu...! Hey, wait a minute! Come back with me wallet, ya thieving bilge rat!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, that's funny.
Mr. Krabs	Me formula! Darn these flimsy nails! How am I supposed to hide me formula with this nonsense? Ah, well. It's the life I choose to live.
Mr. Krabs	I'm here to steal back me customers, with the savory flavor of the Krabby Patty!  Now, go get it!
Mr. Krabs	We're trapped! Trapped, I tell you!
Mr. Krabs	Aw, look at us! Old, gray...
Mr. Krabs	Hang on a minute, don't you hear that?
Mr. Krabs	Where'd he go?
Mr. Krabs	That's it. Just wait 'till I get me claws on your...
Mr. Krabs	Oh she does, does she? I'll handle this, laddie.  Yes, Queen Amphitrite.  Very convincing, but you're gonna have to call pretty early to fool ol' Eugene Krabs, PRANKSTER! . They think I was born yesterday. Aye-aye-aye. Does 7:00 work for you, your majesty?  Oil up yer spatula boy, for tonight you fry for a king.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, that's better. Looks lovely, Squidward. Excellent work. How goes it over here?
Mr. Krabs	This ain't for you, lad. This is for King Neptune. Today is his birthday.
Mr. Krabs	Thank you.
Mr. Krabs	Huh? Okay, who's ready for a piping hot Krabby Patty? Would you like the first one, your highness?
Mr. Krabs	Come on, Krabs! Think, think!  Ooh!
Mr. Krabs	Ready for a room temperature Krabby Patty yet?
Mr. Krabs	What he say?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward has his own TV show?
Mr. Krabs	The Krusty Krab! The Krusty Krab! Eat at the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs	That sounded like me beloved teenage daughter, Pearl. I'm coming, princess!
Mr. Krabs	Okay, Pearl! I wasn't sure what to get, so I just brought the whole--
Mr. Krabs	You're havin' one of them, uh, you know, one of them, um, growth spouts. It means you're healthy.
Mr. Krabs	Uhhh, can't. It's late, and all the shops are closed. We're just gonna have to wait until morning to find you something to eat.
Mr. Krabs	No, wait! I'll think of something.  Food. Where? Where? Food. Where? Where? Huh?
Mr. Krabs	Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today.  And don't even think about coming back here until that destructive device of yours is gone.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, thank you Sandy. Thank you Sandy.
Mr. Krabs	The secret of the Krabby Patty formula. Jackpot!
Mr. Krabs	The secret to the Krabby Patty formula is...!
Mr. Krabs	Money, money, gonna make some money!  Ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. Boys, you're early!  Wait!
Mr. Krabs	Boys, boys, boys!  Help! Help!
Mr. Krabs	Grease slick, eeh?
Mr. Krabs	Hmm.
Mr. Krabs	So I'm gonna go find  out what that rascal's up to!  Excuse me! Excuse me! Comin' through!  What the?  Try Plankton's... new delicerous... Chummy Patties... now with edible flavor?  Clearly somethin' crabby is goin' on here.
Mr. Krabs	Be that as it may, Plankton! It takes 2 to tango.
Mr. Krabs	Unhealthy? Boy, didn't anybody tell yeh?
Mr. Krabs	Just hangin' a new sign, Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Uhh... I already see the...  Whoa!  Gribbets Mollusk!  Eeeagh! What in the name of Neptune is this?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! Get those seven orders of Wow soup out to table 3 pronto! We gotta keep these customers happy or Plankton will steal them back!
Mr. Krabs	You know what I think SpongeBob? I think you should be thinking about NOT thinking and get back to work!
Mr. Krabs	It is. Unless I can find a way to get this grease soaked up.
Mr. Krabs	Are you kidding? He's an absolute treasure to have around the restaurant!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, as much as I don't like doing it, I have to let him go.  Gotten too big for his cage.  Go on, little guy. Fly away. You'll be missed.
Mr. Krabs	Ever so gently...
Mr. Krabs	Eh?  Hey, hey, hey. Let's not be hasty. Why didn't ya say you were buying your pet a Krabby Patty? Listen. Tell you what, for your troubles I'll give you two Krabby Patties at regular price.  SpongeBob, give this responsible pet owner two Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, sure just come in five hours early tomorrow to finish up the parking lot.
Mr. Krabs	Money back?!
Mr. Krabs	Eww.  Disgusting. Ahem. yep it's pretty special all right. And it can be yours for only...
Mr. Krabs	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, settle down. All this brawling is over a toy? You two shouldn't let a little trinkle between youse two. You should be ashamed of yourselves. If I give you each of ya another toy, would that make you happy?
Mr. Krabs	Now listen up, son. I called ye here on the official Krusty Krab business. Every year, me fellow cheapskate crabs meet and discuss new ways of being stinky in the workplace. But more than that, they bestow the award for Cheapest Krab. And this year,  I've been nominated!
Mr. Krabs	No.
Mr. Krabs	No.
Mr. Krabs	Ooh! No! Now, this'll be a great learning experience for you, so keep yer brain peeled!
Mr. Krabs	Chintzy McGee?!
Mr. Krabs	It means he wants money for nothing.  So watch closely.  There ye are, lad.
Mr. Krabs	Go on boy! The quarter's getting away!
Mr. Krabs	Of course.
Mr. Krabs	Let's mangle.
Mr. Krabs	I need ya to testify about how cheap I am! So if you need to do a little exaggeratin'...  Ye not getting it, are ye?  Exaggeratin' is like tellin' the truth, only with little lies sprinkled in to make it, uh... true...er.
Mr. Krabs	Exaggerate!
Mr. Krabs	Thanks.
Mr. Krabs	"Sure, boy! But why not ""exaggerate"" the whole wall?  Well, I didn't win the award, but it's been nice exaggeratin' with you, boy."
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, you're late! Why are you bright green, and what happened to your legs?
Mr. Krabs	Ewww.
Mr. Krabs	I told you, there's no early-bird special, now stop calling me here-- Mother!
Mr. Krabs	Hmm.. Okay, uhhh. I suppose you could put it with the nacho cheese, no one's got near that in years.
Mr. Krabs	Oh! Here we go! Found it!
Mr. Krabs	Now not so fast, Mr. Squidward, the law requires that all employees have a secure place for personal items. So you are required by law, to share.
Mr. Krabs	Private SpongeBob! Ahoy!
Mr. Krabs	Sure, why not?
Mr. Krabs	Yes! I've already calculated how many new customers I'll get once it's finished. You can see fo yourself in this series of these charts and diagrams I have displayed!
Mr. Krabs	Alright, Plankton! It's Eugene Krabs, here, with, What's-His-Name! Now c'mon out!
Mr. Krabs	Don't play coy with us, Shelly. We both know you've been up to no good. Now start talking.
Mr. Krabs	I don't know.
Mr. Krabs	Well, I'm gonna do the only thing I can do when me character is tested by insurmountable odds: lie on me back and sob loudly.
Mr. Krabs	No, SpongeBob. Squidward's right.  It's high time we started accepting facts. [SpongeBob runs over to a fax machine and pulls out a new one]
Mr. Krabs	No, SpongeBob. And its time to activate Plan Zed-9er9er.
Mr. Krabs	Plankton, I'm ready to negoitiate a price for me secret formula.
Mr. Krabs	Up there!  Whoa, nelly!!!
Mr. Krabs	Hold on. Don't you want to hear my annual scary story?
Mr. Krabs	Have a seat, me boy.  Every year on Halloween night, the Flying Dutchman descends on Bikini Bottom, in a pirate ship, just like this.  Only bigger!
Mr. Krabs	Ah, Scaredy Pants gets easier to scare every year!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, guess what?  Yeah, I'll come back later.
Mr. Krabs	It's gonna cost a fortune to get this fixed. Thanks to you.
Mr. Krabs	She'll be filling in for Squidward while he's...  ...on vacation! Isn't that right, Mrs. Puff?
Mr. Krabs	It certainly has. Now SpongeBob, would you please show Mrs. Puff her new duties vis-a-vis with her recently changed life? 'Cause I'm sure a snail can't be bothered to do it.
Mr. Krabs	Ahh, that's the stuff.  Hey, something don't smell right. SpongeBob! Hey, what are you burning out here, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Ready for instant?  Fire!  Take cover!  Oh, ha, ha, it didn't blow up another dud, Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	Ha ha ha ha!
Mr. Krabs	Who knew Plankton was so afraid of whales?  Pearl me darling daughter, you saved my business and my Formular now get us out of this trap.
Mr. Krabs	It's all catching up to me...  Please, Pearl?
Mr. Krabs	Really? He's a mess!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, Plankton. Back for more, aren'y ya? Okay, here it goes.  Boo!
Mr. Krabs	No. No. Muh-muh-make it stop! Please!
Mr. Krabs	You, I'm used to. Why is he so happy?
Mr. Krabs	Um, I suppose...
Mr. Krabs	Oh, you. Oh, sure.
Mr. Krabs	Please take your seats.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward...
Mr. Krabs	Oh, well, that's OK, then. But get him a Krabby Patty!
Mr. Krabs	And for you?
Mr. Krabs	Good news. The play is such a success, I've added two more shows and a matinee! Break a leg tomorrow!
Mr. Krabs	Where the devil are we?
Mr. Krabs	Well... You know... Unwinding. Enjoying the free parking.  What's happening to your little critter here?
Mr. Krabs	Thank you SpongeBob. How about you bring your sneagle into work with ye.
Mr. Krabs	There you go. Bring in that change. I've been working on that one for months. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr!
Mr. Krabs	Anything on the floor gains.
Mr. Krabs	Heh, heh. Excuse me mam.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah. But you still have work to do.
Mr. Krabs	Now back to our treasure hunt. Eh, boy.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. There's no stopping. There's a laundromat that needs to be cleaned out. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr. Cleaned out. Get it. Ahh. Never mind. MUSH!
Mr. Krabs	What!? How is that possible? Uhh. Now I want you to paint the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs	Now little sneagle. Ready to do some laundry. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr.
Mr. Krabs	Arr, arr, arr. I guess he didn't see that coming.  Hey what's the big ide-er. We've just found a pot at the end of the rainbow. Aieeeee!
Mr. Krabs	Arr, arr, arr, arr.
Mr. Krabs	You look fine to me. Now stop being such a baby and make me some money. Excuse me pregnant lady coming through!  Uh, he he. Hoo boy. It... it's sure hard being pregger!
Mr. Krabs	What do you mean? I'm just showing Rory off.
Mr. Krabs	No, if I was rich I wouldn't have to hire the likes of you!
Mr. Krabs	Arr, arr, arr, arr. Well what do ya know?
Mr. Krabs	That would be me.
Mr. Krabs	Look, SpongeBob, you see all this stuff, including you and me, are brought here when the mermaids sing their beautiful song, the mermaids' song triggers this here contraption, to suck this pile like a vacuum. Dumpin' all the contents here on this island, that is how we ended up surrounded. With all this valuable and resellable stuff!  Oh, Yippee! Another shipment! Free stuff, here I- come?  Pretty neat, aye, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Oh me little angel. Thank you mysterious signing mermaids.
Mr. Krabs	What's the matter, boy-o?  You're Krabby Patty meter is on empty! We've got to get a Krabby Patty into you quick or-  Please great vacuum cleaner, please just give us just one-  ...Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs	Look, boy, I've got a way with the ladies, and I guarantee the old Krabs charm, will have them telling us exactly how to get out of here.  So there's really no way out of this place? I really need to get back to the Krusty Krab to stop my arch-nemesis from ruining my business.
Mr. Krabs	The mall? But Pearl-
Mr. Krabs	It sure is, what?
Mr. Krabs	So, you've been the one making me Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs	Well, I've certainly seen enough .
Mr. Krabs	Too late!
Mr. Krabs	How did you know I wear a sleep mask?
Mr. Krabs	Okay, let's see what's under the hood.  I think that should do it.
Mr. Krabs	See, boy, just a bonical ramblings of an old lady. Nothing to worry about.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, you're right, there is no such thing as curses. Ha.
Mr. Krabs	Don't worry, SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs has a special technique when dealing with situations like these. It's called beggin' and pleadin'
Mr. Krabs	Because if ya' don't, me business will be ruined forever.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, wait a minute, granny, what part of this-
Mr. Krabs	Hold it, SpongeBob, Look.
Mr. Krabs	I really don't have a choice
Mr. Krabs	Ahh, now it's time to lift that curse, like you promised.
Mr. Krabs	THE DRAIN PLUG!?!?!?  SpongeBob!!!  What in Neptune's bathtub do you think you're doing, lad?
Mr. Krabs	Anyway,  it said that the Main Drain beckoned to them, putting them under its spell.
Mr. Krabs	Legend has it that their curiosity got the best of 'em.  And they pulled the plug.  The entire ocean rusted in the drain and sucked those two kids right down.  The drain was so powerful, it pulled all of Bikini Bottom into its gaping maw, causing an apocalypse to the sea!  And nobody was ever heard from...again.
Mr. Krabs	That's right one day, Plankton and I were wandering around.
Mr. Krabs	Eh, ya lemons. Afraid of a little lavar? CASHY! Noo! Make it stop raining fire of destruction!
Mr. Krabs	What is it, boy?
Mr. Krabs	I know this process like the back of me claw.  We always start with...  ...flour.  Next, we add  barnacle shavings. It's like riding a boat-cycle, ain't it, boy?
Mr. Krabs	What are you on about, boy? Third step's always sea salt.
Mr. Krabs	Aren't you getting a little tired of this, Plankton?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, that's it, you genius. You just solved me decades-old dellemer.
Mr. Krabs	All right, boy, let's get back to making them patties.
Mr. Krabs	On the opposite side of the ocean, yeah.  And now I've gotta go  all  the way  there  to  get it.
Mr. Krabs	This, No. This is the key to me heart?  This is the safe-deposit box key.
Mr. Krabs	Good luck, me boy! Don't let me down!
Mr. Krabs	Sure. I believe ya.  Say, since you went through all the trouble of getting here, there you go, Plankton.  Enjoy the scenery. Hey, where'd he go?
Mr. Krabs	No...!
Mr. Krabs	Hmm. Future generations, huh?
Mr. Krabs	And there's your commemorative time capsule key chain. That'll be $49.57.
Mr. Krabs	But, before we do, I'd like to make a contribution of my own. A copy of the Krabby Patty formula!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! Boyo, you've got to help me. Pearl's got her heart set on a new pair of shoes. Your job is to tell her no.
Mr. Krabs	Overtime? O... o... o-ver-time...  Overtime? Hm, let's see here. Over, oversold, overspend, ah! Overtime. More money per hour...  What a filthy, disgusting word!
Mr. Krabs	Arrrgh! Out, out, and STAY OUT! And don't you come back until you've swabbed that poop deck you call a mouth!
Mr. Krabs	Okay, SpongeBob. Time to hit the road. SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Pushin' your luck a bit, aren't you, kid?  You were nearly late this morning. You got to be more concientierous or I'll have to start dockin' your pay. Oh, yeah. That's what I'll do.  Doo dee doo, doo dee doo, doo doo doo!  Musical Doodle! SpongeBob! Wake up, boy-o! Don't you need some patties to get started there?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! You gotta cut out that singin', boy! It's repellin' me profits.
Mr. Krabs	Let's just rip the little sucker out!
Mr. Krabs	Oh how do they know my name?
Mr. Krabs	It's not that! It's just that you haven't paid the fee.
Mr. Krabs	Closing time already?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, okay! You may give your snail a Krabby Patty. But please give me a tip, cause pets are sooo special!
Mr. Krabs	Did you check the freezer?!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, yeah.
Mr. Krabs	What?
Mr. Krabs	Plankton?
Mr. Krabs	Don't forget the cheese.
Mr. Krabs	What are you going on about? I let you turn the sign every day. (cut to SpongeBob walking up to the closed sign and puts a briefcase down. Opens it up to put on his 'ceremonial gloves' to turn the sign)
Mr. Krabs	(jumps on Squidward, squishing him) Who dares lay claim to the title best restaurant in the sea?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, I don't need a spy.
Mr. Krabs	Just tell me what you see, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	What you're describin' is an absolute dump. Are there any unique or interesting amenities that might attract me customers in any way?
Mr. Krabs	Someone among us with a big talent...
Mr. Krabs	Um, Larry The Lobster?
Mr. Krabs	My mom?
Mr. Krabs	"Hey, hey, now hold on, Mr. Squidward. You and I aren't that different from each other. We both ""make product."""
Mr. Krabs	You got it, long as it's done by opening tomorrow.
Mr. Krabs	Here you go. (SpongeBob is Squidward's assistant)
Mr. Krabs	Like this?
Mr. Krabs	Or this? (poses as the thinker)
Mr. Krabs	Come on, Squidward, I'm about to give out!
Mr. Krabs	What's that supposed to be?
Mr. Krabs	Well, we should do a dry run before we let the general public use it. SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Oh it's a piece all right, a piece of junk!
Mr. Krabs	Welcome to The Krusty Krab!   You seem to be a mollusk of deserting taste. Could I introduce you to a side of Kelp Fries?  Hey! I'm not on the menu!
Mr. Krabs	Now I'm impressed!
Mr. Krabs	Would you pay the same as what a Krabby Patty costs?
Mr. Krabs	"It says ""Krusty Dogs, only $3.99! Or $4.99 with cheese!"
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! Three more orders of Krusty Dogs! Extra Krusty!
Mr. Krabs	I'm just going to make a few changes to the Krusty Krab menu. That's all!
Mr. Krabs	Pardon me.
Mr. Krabs	Maybe. But now we have this!
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy SpongeBob! How's go the wieners?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! What happened in here? Where all me customers?! What are we gonna do?
Mr. Krabs	What's all the racket?!
Mr. Krabs	That's odd.
Mr. Krabs	Found it!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, yeah, nobody's treasure. You're such a nice boss. You expect me to believe this malarkey?!  You're a stonewall, eh? We'll see about that!  Where'd you two blunders find the gold coin?
Mr. Krabs	"Eh? What's this? ""Token Has No Monetary Value?"" Tokens?! This must be a decoy."
Mr. Krabs	"""Must Be This Tall To Ride?"""
Mr. Krabs	This place ain't got no treasure! Keep your worthless hunk of junk!
Mr. Krabs	That's right, folks! We spare no expect to restore this plastic ship to its former glory!
Mr. Krabs	Whatwhatwhat are you talking about? You can't take me to the pokey! I
Mr. Krabs	Are you on some new allergy medication, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Shh! No more of this karate stuff, lad. Or you're fired.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, you're fired!
Mr. Krabs	Huh? What the barnacle?
Mr. Krabs	Now, how much is that- Mr. Krabs gets cut off by Plankton going through his eyes.  Eugh!
Mr. Krabs	Hmmm. Sounds like a mutiny.  What the...?!  What in Neptune's knickers is this?!
Mr. Krabs	Oooooh. He requires , does he?  What's all the ruckus?!  Oh no! Please, no! This is terrible!  Are you hurt?
Mr. Krabs	Injured? On the job?! Oh no! That would mean...
Mr. Krabs	Please don't report me to the OWS. I'll do anything. Anything for you.
Mr. Krabs	What did you say?
Mr. Krabs	Well, at least there's not that much customers anyway.  Of course.
Mr. Krabs	I ain't touching your tentacles with a 10-ft pole...
Mr. Krabs	Oh, for the love of peat moss.
Mr. Krabs	No!! Oh, Why, why, why?!  Hold on a sec. That's my security surveillance camera.
Mr. Krabs	That's nice.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, just a little security measure I've been working on. Now all Krabby Patties self-destruct 10 feet beyond the Krusty Krab! Sucker!
Mr. Krabs	And that's the way we like it.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no they won't, because I'll steal the Flabby Patty recipe first!
Mr. Krabs	Will!
Mr. Krabs	Ha! Recipe theivin' is as easy as pie.
Mr. Krabs	That'll show hi--
Mr. Krabs	Okay, so here's the plan. I want you to--  I'm sorry, do you mind?  Let's go some place more private.  Once I stand in line I want you to--  Waitin' in line here. That's all.
Mr. Krabs	Looks like you blew it again, Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	We look ridiculous. Nobody's gonna buy this disguise.
Mr. Krabs	Stop whining!
Mr. Krabs	No you don't, Plankton!  Ah! Give it here!
Mr. Krabs	Wait a minute, this isn't a recipe for patties. It's a recipe for friendship.
Mr. Krabs	Great idea, pal.  We'll teach you about teamwork. () Get back here!
Mr. Krabs	It-it-it's just a hole in the wall, boy. It doesn't have a flavor.
Mr. Krabs	Boy, I don't know how I think think of this stuff, but I think I got a winner! We are putting in a drive through!
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy, SpongeBob. What's with all the booty?
Mr. Krabs	Because it was...  Free!
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Oh? Here comes one now!
Mr. Krabs	Well...they cost as much as...as uh...as a...real microphone and...speaker.
Mr. Krabs	What do I look like I'm made out of tin cans?
Mr. Krabs	Oh? Why SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	I guess I'll be retiring early after all! .
Mr. Krabs	Oh sure! Right! Phew! Hah hah hah...SpongeBob can you get the kind officer two-
Mr. Krabs	Well...don't you worry Mr. Mayor! I have a answer for that too!  There you go! See now we have two drive thrus, two lines, and I'll make money twice as fast! .
Mr. Krabs	Easy boys! Easy! Don't you think you both are getting a little carried away? I mean, I hardly call this a riot! Right, hah hah. Like-  Oh....kay...Don't worry! I can solve this!  More drive thrus! More money!
Mr. Krabs	Come on, boys! Get me to the green mats!
Mr. Krabs	Heeelp!
Mr. Krabs	Great. Now we're trapped.
Mr. Krabs	Not you again!
Mr. Krabs	That, me boy, is none other than the Abominable Snow Mollusk.
Mr. Krabs	Argargarg! I'd sooner swallow a jellyfish the winning with y--
Mr. Krabs	My formula! We've got to get back to Bikini Bottom!
Mr. Krabs	Lookin' clear so far.
Mr. Krabs	The Chum Bucket, now serving... Krabby Patties?!
Mr. Krabs	Not if I have anything to say and or do about it!
Mr. Krabs	You get back here, Plankton!
Mr. Krabs	We're trapped!
Mr. Krabs	He'll have to wait for nature to take its' course.
Mr. Krabs	There, there, laddie. Just let the legal system run its course.
Mr. Krabs	What?! It was your idea, huh?
Mr. Krabs	"Please be money, please be money.  Oh! That's not money. It's from SpongeBob.  ""Dear Mr... Krabs, please come to my house tonight. I am having a free money party."" Free money party!? This sounds too good to be true!"
Mr. Krabs	Heh, it's supposed to be three wishes.
Mr. Krabs	Well, I suppose I could make that extra ticket available to, say, who ever is to be me man-servant?
Mr. Krabs	Ah, ha ha ha! Now push me back to the top, push me to the top!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, well. One more time around the deck!
Mr. Krabs	Oh yeah!
Mr. Krabs	Uh, I don't know how anyone can stand this slop. It makes me miss our grub over back at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob, be a good man-servant and fix me up a Krabby Patty, would ya?
Mr. Krabs	Come to daddy!  Hey, wait a minute, there's chum all over this bill. Hey, buddy! Where did you get this?
Mr. Krabs	Who's ready for some excitement?
Mr. Krabs	I'm sure you know this charming fellow!  Here's the one that almost got away!  Look at these pile towers of golden green!  Here's how the whole thing started!
Mr. Krabs	For a nominal fee of course. So, what do think boy?
Mr. Krabs	Pearl my dear! Are you all packed and ready to go?
Mr. Krabs	See? You two are already having fun together!
Mr. Krabs	Noooo! No. The place we are going is much better!
Mr. Krabs	Bathroom Land! Oh SpongeBob! You kill me!
Mr. Krabs	It's the Bikini Bottom Mint! Where they make all of the money! Have you ever seen anything so beautiful in all of your life?
Mr. Krabs	You hear that boy?  The entire money making... process!
Mr. Krabs	Oh!  Uh... uh...
Mr. Krabs	He he he he!
Mr. Krabs	Pretty neat huh boy? That's where they...  ...DESTROY MONEY? NOOO!  NOOO! WHY? WHY?
Mr. Krabs	Grrrr... YAHHH!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what's holding up those patties?
Mr. Krabs	Alright, SpongeBob, you're too sick to work.
Mr. Krabs	Shiny dimes.
Mr. Krabs	You had a what?
Mr. Krabs	Great, then it's settled, let's go catch us some ghost gold!
Mr. Krabs	Who needs a soul when you're filthy rich?
Mr. Krabs	All righty, then. Let's get while the getting's good! Ooh!  Looks like I missed one! Uh... it seems to be stuck... uuuuuuhhhh...
Mr. Krabs	Thanks, lassie. Now, let's just get this here bag of doubloons back to the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs	How's the holdup, Mr. Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Good job Laddy, another fullful day pushing patties.
Mr. Krabs	Obsession is kind of a strong word.  Sleep tight, my little angels.
Mr. Krabs	Me Krabby Patty Formula!
Mr. Krabs	You know, I don't think I trust this nice, polite, pleasant Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	Didn't you already mop this area?
Mr. Krabs	Pearl, what brings you in on such a fine afternoon?
Mr. Krabs	Oh-ho-ho-ho. Now, calm down there, my little Pearl. I'm sure it can't be half as awful as you...  Great rusty hinges of Davy Jones' Locker!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, SpongeBob.  How would you like to...  Ease it!   How would you like to do your dear old chum a favor and raid this beautiful daughter of her evil barnacle?
Mr. Krabs	Don't just stand there, boy! Come help me with this!  There we go. Sometimes it just gets a little stuck.
Mr. Krabs	Their precious essences are harvested, and after a brief cooling process, tumble out this conveyor belt as fresh, wonderful bars of soap!  Fresh and invigorating! Plus, it's absolutely free.
Mr. Krabs	Got to go, keep your cellphone!
Mr. Krabs	Hey! What's going on out here?
Mr. Krabs	Wait a minute. Those straws cost me money!
Mr. Krabs	Well uh, I just happen to be in the neighborhood and was wondering if you could see you in clear and grace me with a comprehensive tour of your homesweet treedome.  I hear the giant soybean is lovely this time of the year.
Mr. Krabs	Huh? Oh yeah, that sounds interesting Sandy, but uh actually...
Mr. Krabs	Or a supply of entire rest---.
Mr. Krabs	Put it there!  Hey!
Mr. Krabs	You better get him out of here if you wanna keep him that way!  Bubbles today. They don't seem to understand the value of money.
Mr. Krabs	Let me see that!  Thank you! Look boy, I don't know what in coral cabins what a restraining order is, but I do know whatever's going on here clearly ain't working. Now I want this ship sailing smoothly! On the double! Or I'll be forced to remove more gold stars from your employee performance chart!
Mr. Krabs	It'll stand. Oh, unless you want to talk with SpongeBob
Mr. Krabs	Nice work, Patrick! Break time's over, Mr. Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Nah, I don't think so!  We need a gimmic that's nothing short of a masterpiece.
Mr. Krabs	Heh, you call this art? Looks like a swappy's footlocker.
Mr. Krabs	Great idea, Farkle. Gotta protect me valuable property.
Mr. Krabs	I know that scream anywhere! It's me profits dying!  Stop that thief!
Mr. Krabs	Thanks very much. Enjoy the show. You sure saved the day boy-yo.
Mr. Krabs	Relish Patties! Get your Freaky Clone Jelly Relish Patties! Only 4 bucks extra!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, you're right. We have to do everything in our power to bring those customers back. We'll triple the prices.
Mr. Krabs	Don't you say it, boy.
Mr. Krabs	NO!
Mr. Krabs	Well, that was better than I expected. Well only one more thing left to do now. I have to leave back with me mom.
Mr. Krabs	Good point.
Mr. Krabs	And, Squidward! I expect more from you. Well, actually, no... I don't.
Mr. Krabs	Not a bad bit of wooden starry if I do say so meself. Time to put the finishing touches on her.  Hm.
Mr. Krabs	Ho ho, kiddo. Look out. Just applying some plaster stucco exterior here.
Mr. Krabs	Good work, boy!
Mr. Krabs	Yes, sir, sure as the sea's wet.
Mr. Krabs	Huh. He always has been a knucklehead.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, that sounds promising.
Mr. Krabs	You're right, must be interfering with her circuitry
Mr. Krabs	"SpongeBob, what part of ""free computer"" are you not understanding?"
Mr. Krabs	I see Squidward must not have gotten the last company text mail. Karen will be taking over your duties from now on Mr. Squidward. She's efficient and more importantly: I don't have to pay her.
Mr. Krabs	Welcome to the fight of the century! Where for only $5.99, and the purchase of two Krabby Patties, you will plead the answer to the age-old question. Which is superior? High-speed integrated circuits?
Mr. Krabs	Keep it up, Mr Squidward. The kids love robots.
Mr. Krabs	You obviously you didn't use your hydronic mustard gage.  You think mustard grows from seeds!  Oh, at this rate, I'll be broke in  411 years!
Mr. Krabs	That's it!  You're insomniac!
Mr. Krabs	That's right!  Now, get!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	You didn't hear my words, did ya? You couldn't be bothered to get some shut eye, could ya?
Mr. Krabs	Just terrible.
Mr. Krabs	"Haven't ye ever heard the saying ""If you don't stop making that face, it'll freeze that way""?"
Mr. Krabs	Permanently!
Mr. Krabs	Good. I hope you've learned your lesson.
Mr. Krabs	: Ahem. But what's with this cubed posture
Mr. Krabs	: Wait, come back!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, you better stand up this instant or... Huh?
Mr. Krabs	: LOOK! Squidward has it too!
Mr. Krabs	Now open wide.
Mr. Krabs	Well, Mr. Squidward, in my expert opinion, you look fit as a fiddle.
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Krabs nothing! Just go ahead. I'm gonna keep sayin' it.
Mr. Krabs	That's better. Now what can I do you for?
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward, got a minute?
Mr. Krabs	I need you to make yourself scarce for a while.
Mr. Krabs	Well how about a little less pleasure and a little more work.
Mr. Krabs	Who's gonna run it? I could run this place blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back. I'll show ya.
Mr. Krabs	Well, SpongeBob, funny you should ask. Because in me expert medical opinion, I think I may be coming down with a nasty case of Squid's Disease.
Mr. Krabs	Today only, the Krusty Krab presents our first annual bun seed guessing contest.  Guess how many seeds are in the jar and win a f-- f-- sorry, a f-- f-- I'll try again. A f-- f--  free Krabby Patty!
Mr. Krabs	Nope.
Mr. Krabs	That's not even a number.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, right. Like they would even take your call.
Mr. Krabs	New trainee.
Mr. Krabs	No worries. That nitwit Plankton hasn't got a chance.
Mr. Krabs	500298, 500299, 500300.  I win.
Mr. Krabs	Doesn't your spatula need aligning or something?
Mr. Krabs	No, this is isn't part of the show.
Mr. Krabs	So, one day, when the lad was minding his own business, Flankton struck and took a huge bite out of the Laddie's face.
Mr. Krabs	Psst. I got a plan. You keep that blasted bureaucrat busy.
Mr. Krabs	No buns? Drat the luck.
Mr. Krabs	You gotta swallow it here on the premises.
Mr. Krabs	Why, Christmas is me favorite time of the year! After all, 'tis the season of gettin'!
Mr. Krabs	Will you get some nerve, SpongeBob! This is comin' outta yer salary!
Mr. Krabs	Huh?  Get out of me pocket, ya foul goblin!
Mr. Krabs	Sooo, we're having a slow day. At least Old Jethra has stuck with us. That Krabby Patty hitting the spot, Jethra?
Mr. Krabs	Good evening, Madam. Table for two, please?
Mr. Krabs	What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
Mr. Krabs	I figure it's the least I can do for him after causing all that mayhem over at the Chum Bucket. In fact, I promoted him. He's our new doormat!
Mr. Krabs	You two! Follow me!
Mr. Krabs	Well, according to my research, a full 2% of the population of Bikini Bottom has never set foot in the Krusty Krab. That's 2% of money that's not in me pocket. And when I see that 2%, I get soooooo maaaad!
Mr. Krabs	I don't know what you're doing, boy-o, but it's working like cake busters. This place is as packed as the trills-with-gills. In fact, I'm seeing some of the same holdouts I saw this morning
Mr. Krabs	That's him! Let him in! It's the last 1%.  Gotcha!
Mr. Krabs	Its true.
Mr. Krabs	Ohoho no you are!
Mr. Krabs	Ha! Good luck with thatludicrous idea! .  Petition?  Squidward! SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Thanks for saving me shell, boy!
Mr. Krabs	This is outrageous!  You see what Plankton's doing, don't ya? He's undermining the democratic process by lab raging his temporarily financial windfall in order to buy every signature in Bikini Bottom.  There's 20, 40, 50... We just bought mine 4 times! And me tasty food is one thing.  But how can I compete with free money?  I'm doomed! Well... clean around, boy. Border up. I'm afraid we're closing up for good.
Mr. Krabs	If you wanna bulldoze me restaurant,  it's gonna be long and painful!
Mr. Krabs	Uhh... yeah.
Mr. Krabs	What's this? Where are the doubloons?
Mr. Krabs	Ha ha ha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.
Mr. Krabs	You're fired!
Mr. Krabs	Treasure.  There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, you can't walk out on me now.
Mr. Krabs	That's awful lad. If the Dutchman hears ya, we'll never get his treasure.
Mr. Krabs	One, two, three...
Mr. Krabs	Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?
Mr. Krabs	Arrgh!  Keep a sharp lookout. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.
Mr. Krabs	Out with it man, arrgh!
Mr. Krabs	Answer Patrick. Which was is east?
Mr. Krabs	That's west, Patrick. You're fired again. 9,551... 9,552...
Mr. Krabs	I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!
Mr. Krabs	That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?
Mr. Krabs	Well, what are you waiting for lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
Mr. Krabs	What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!
Mr. Krabs	All for one.
Mr. Krabs	All for one.
Mr. Krabs	Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest.
Mr. Krabs	Thanks for all the great tips! I think you should be on your way! Good bye! Good luck! Have a nice day! SOOO!!! What are we waiting for? It's high tide time we went on tour!
Mr. Krabs	Roadie! Check!
Mr. Krabs	Anywhere is fine.
Mr. Krabs	We have a tour bus, sound equipment, a roadie!
Mr. Krabs	Deal!
Mr. Krabs	Sorry Squidward but that is physically impossible!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah...hard to believe, I know! My heard aches when I think of me old girl cold and lonely. Just sitting in the front window of that dirty pawn shop at the mercy of any random joe who just happens to pass on by.
Mr. Krabs	Thank you Mr......Supermarker Manager.
Mr. Krabs	Oh don't worry Squidward! These geezers really know how to party!
Mr. Krabs	It's uh...uh...um... Well it's right over there obviously!  I'll just leave the three of you right here to set up! I some important tour management business to attend to if you know!
Mr. Krabs	Phew, that's good! 'Cause for a second there I thought that we maybe...
Mr. Krabs	Quick! On the bus!
Mr. Krabs	But Mr. Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Thank you! Come again please!  He he he!
Mr. Krabs	Why'd I owe you money for!?
Mr. Krabs	Well Krusty Krab, this is good bye... WHY!? WHY!?
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward, what's with all the dilly-dallyin'? We got customer's money  to take!
Mr. Krabs	Patrick-Man? What kind of ridiculous name is that?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, sweet dollar. Oh, just look at you. So clean. So crisp. Now come to Krabsy.
Mr. Krabs	Enough!  We've all had our fill of Patrick-Man!
Mr. Krabs	Not so fast! I think I need you to use your superpowers one last time.
Mr. Krabs	There you are boy!  The Milkshake Academy! You know boy? Milkshaking technology and know-how is advanced since you were last a cadet!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, Squidward, enough duff-dragging! Get to your stations, pronto!
Mr. Krabs	All right! That's enough, you two. Time to serve some customers!
Mr. Krabs	Watch his head? Why don't you watch his diaper?  And get it changed!
Mr. Krabs	What are you talking about? The Krusty Krab is a standard in fast food cleanliness! An urchin wouldn't dare step hide into this establishment.   The grill is still on...isn't it?
Mr. Krabs	Hmm...it may take a pest to catch a pest.  It's a deal but no tricks, or you'll be the chef's special!
Mr. Krabs	You think? SPONGEBOB!
Mr. Krabs	Cactus?
Mr. Krabs	Spray can?
Mr. Krabs	Psst! Go on, Plankton! Make with the romance!
Mr. Krabs	Ah, who cares about Plankton? What about me restaurant?
Mr. Krabs	I don't care. As long it's far away from the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs	No! Farther!  Well, that takes care of that particular problem!
Mr. Krabs	(screams and yells) SPONGEBOB!!!!
Mr. Krabs	Tonight eh? That doesn't leave me much time! This is gonna be close, but we'll be ready for them!
Mr. Krabs	Plankton! Don't do it!
Mr. Krabs	Yep! I'm a winner!
Mr. Krabs	Hold on, kiddo. We still have one more ingredient.
Mr. Krabs	We can get it later.
Mr. Krabs	Quit that, boy. It's creepy. Spatulas can't talk. And if I catch yous talking to your next one, I'll lock you up in a padded kitchen.
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, that's great SpongeBob.  Wait a minute. What did I tell ya about talking to spatulas. Only do it if it makes me money.
Mr. Krabs	Just read it.
Mr. Krabs	You got that right, boyo.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, yeah? Well, I can't see nothing from down here!
Mr. Krabs	Ok, I'll do it.
Mr. Krabs	Well, darlin', it's like this: Where you see disaster, I see dollar signs. So, SpongeBob, you got any of that bubble soap left?  Please have your money ready!  Thank you!  Right this way.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, hi! I want to see all of your money!
Mr. Krabs	Not again...  Scallops!
Mr. Krabs	So far so good...
Mr. Krabs	Oh, yes! I'll have that please!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, yes! Penny will have one of those!
Mr. Krabs	Gasp! This can't be true!  'Tis true! I landed in money nirvana!  Me wildest dreams finally come true!
Mr. Krabs	I'm fine boy! In fact, I'm dancing with a beautiful lady.
Mr. Krabs	Ah. This is the life.  Sun, sand, and surf. And of course. Mrs. Greenback by my side. What's that? Eh, don't start on me now. I'm sure this remote island has a food source! Krabs just hasn't found it yet, that's all. I'll just eh. Heh heh. So hungry.
Mr. Krabs	You know, boyo. Through this whole ordeal, I've learned a little something about greed. A little something about isolation. Heh. Even a little something about love. And you know what I realized through it all?
Mr. Krabs	Because we never did. That sandwich was on the menu of an old restaurant that lay here a long time ago! Twas' an old ramshackle shack called Rusty's Rib Eye, and the only one who ever knew how to make that sandwich was the owner, Rusty Rickets. However, old Rusty bought the farm 20 years ago.
Mr. Krabs	Good night, kiddo.
Mr. Krabs	You better have a darn good reason for getting me outta bed!
Mr. Krabs	What's going on around here?
Mr. Krabs	Uh, no.
Mr. Krabs	Hundreds, you say?
Mr. Krabs	All right, you ready to sign for these fine dollarsI mean, uh, suckersI mean, uh,some autographs?
Mr. Krabs	My problem is that you aren't workin'! Which means I lose M-U-N-E-E! Which means you lose your J-O-B!
Mr. Krabs	That's a perfect example of what I'm talkin' about! Stayin' busy!
Mr. Krabs	Excellent idea, Mr. SquarePants! Squidward, I'd like you to sweep--
Mr. Krabs	Wash me boat!  Listen, Squidward, I'm gonna get a full day's work out of you one way or another.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah. Everyone's heard of the abominable Yeti Krab...  ...with his long, wide hair, and six-pack abs...  ...and yeller' teeth! And everybody knows that he only comes out of his mountain cave to feed on lazy workers.  He's attracted to the scent, he can smell your lazy, lazy stench from hundreds of miles away!
Mr. Krabs	Precisely. See ya, boys!
Mr. Krabs	We're as good as Yeti food! I blame Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Build me a new safe!
Mr. Krabs	Well, you see, I've been doin' some calculatin' and, you know, crunching the old numbers. And it turns out that I'll save a whole nickel if I cut your salary. Completely.
Mr. Krabs	I'm afraid not, Squidward. You've got seniority.
Mr. Krabs	I'll also need the hat. Allow me.  Go ahead; take a moment to collect yourself. Long as you need.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, laddy.  I shoulda never let you go. The Krusty Krab has fallen apart without you. You're rehired, boy.
Mr. Krabs	Well, look at this. Lazing about.  Can I get you anything else, another pillow, maybe? A cappuccino machine?
Mr. Krabs	Oh no, lad, you're not coming in here looking like that!  You're going straight home for a nice long bubble bath!
Mr. Krabs	"Oh no! It says ""Buy one for a fee!"""
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, okay, always nice to hear.
Mr. Krabs	All right, that's enough. Patties with emotional flavors...  ...it's two bits extra. Now pay at the register. What in Davy Jones' locker is going on in here, Mr. Squidward?!
Mr. Krabs	Avast there, lad!  You're wasting your valuable tears, salting me patties with grief.
Mr. Krabs	$100 a semester?!  Well, I can do it for double the price and half the time!
Mr. Krabs	"Why, I couldn't be sure, lad. You don't need a...  ""professional""to teach you how to drive."
Mr. Krabs	Well, rookie mistake, boy. It happens all the time.
Mr. Krabs	This empty parking lot is just the ticket.  Like every young person, the novice boater needs plenty of open, obstacle-free space and the freedom to make mistakes.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, broken wall. That's about $15,000. Oh, kitchen fire. Oh, that'll be about 6 grand.  Ooh, lawsuit? Oh, that's a lot of zeroes! Ugh.     Bleah!
Mr. Krabs	Upsell!
Mr. Krabs	A simple trip to Patrick's house: a line so straight and true.
Mr. Krabs	Now hand me one of them tokens. You'll need your protective headgear.
Mr. Krabs	No, no. It's my fault. We've been going about this all wrong, boy. It's not a pampering you'd be needing. It's a bold and reckless display of confidence!
Mr. Krabs	Thar she blows. The dreaded double roundabout, the most treacherous stretch of road in all of Bikini Bottom. To your starboard, you yield. To your port, they yield to you. And when you're in the middle, it's every man for himself and the devil take the rest!
Mr. Krabs	Buck up, me boy-o.  It's  turn next.
Mr. Krabs	You sure did...uh, I mean, you didn't...I mean, well, no...I mean, well, yes...I mean, uh, look, it was just a friendly, little example: a colorful example.  I was teaching the lad to drive.
Mr. Krabs	Well, no. But I taught me own little girl to drive, you see, and you understand. Do you have any kiddies of your own at home, officer?
Mr. Krabs	Ha! What could be worse than spending money?
Mr. Krabs	: Let me see that.  Alright. Pay is real. Now get in line!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, stop your drama, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Well, I mean you could, OH! You can dust the pickles! Or uh, alphabetize the buns! Ehhh, you could, uh... water down the ketchup!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, what's wrong with Pete? He's not working!
Mr. Krabs	No! Not leaving the workplace for pleasure!
Mr. Krabs	Just in time, Mr. Squidward! You're about to go on the greatest company picnic ever!
Mr. Krabs	Right you are! Here's the food!
Mr. Krabs	Ho, ho. This is so much fun.
Mr. Krabs	Oh no you're not.  You're going to sit right there and enjoy yourself until your productivity increases!
Mr. Krabs	"""The greatest company picnic ever!"""
Mr. Krabs	"""Chumpany Picnic""? That's not how you spell ""Company Picnic""!"
Mr. Krabs	Oh yeah! Well, it's my spot now!
Mr. Krabs	Now, look here, Plankton! Me loyal employees would never be takin' in by such a shallow display...
Mr. Krabs	Huh? Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah.
Mr. Krabs	You sure?
Mr. Krabs	Hey, Squiddie-bird!
Mr. Krabs	My candied pen!
Mr. Krabs	Alright, enough relaxin'. Back to work!
Mr. Krabs	Oh my! That's quite a storm! You know, a storm like this puts me in the mind of me old navy days.
Mr. Krabs	The man whose mission was to make my life a living nightmare!  The roughest, toughest, scaliest old barnacle that ever roamed the briny deep! He was me commandin' officer and he loathe me with the white, hot hatred of a psychotic madman!  They called him,  Captain Scarfish!
Mr. Krabs	But I don't know how!
Mr. Krabs	Aye, sir!
Mr. Krabs	Yes, sir.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, sorry boys.  Captain's orders.  Oh, I can't stand it!  I don't care what the captain says!
Mr. Krabs	Well, flaming cherries jubilee.
Mr. Krabs	I managed to worm some useful information out of him right away. You see, he was an aspiring cook and I talked him into seeking some things down into the brig for me. The tombs of me trade you might say.  I set him to work on a sponge-sugared cathedral that took up most of his attention.  He never suspected that I was using the scraps to fashion a candy-key. Where's your sourpuss friend tonight?
Mr. Krabs	Then listen carefully! We'll have to go down to the cargo-hold and poke holes in the barrels of suntan lotion and scuttle the ship!
Mr. Krabs	Get down to the cargo-hold and check on the captain!  Charge! Hup! Hey! Whoop! Whoa! Hi-yah! Woo!  Close one! Ha-ha!
Mr. Krabs	I can't let you go, lass. That'll be violation of the naval code. Enjoy your last meal. I hope you like sponge-sugar!
Mr. Krabs	Then you'll have to do SpongeBob's job too!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob? That's you, boy? Why aren't you at work? And why are you all dressed up like a nanny puppet subsea hooligowl?
Mr. Krabs	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't abandon ship! I have to work all by meself!
Mr. Krabs	Sure thing Mr. Commissioner! See you at Founders' Day!
Mr. Krabs	"No takers for ""McNulty Challenge"". Ha! What's that suppose to mean?"
Mr. Krabs	Ah! Dumb and hungry. Well, if it isn't Patrick!
Mr. Krabs	You're going up against the best, so you have to be the best! We're gonna light a fire under you boy-o!
Mr. Krabs	Eat!
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, I didn't know you had false teeth.
Mr. Krabs	Or maybe we should be asking what Oswald McNulty is not doing.
Mr. Krabs	We're gonna teach this sea star, a new way to eat! Without tasting.
Mr. Krabs	Krabby Patties, T-shirts, conical hats, and, Patrick's chompers!
Mr. Krabs	That, is a bill, for all those Krabby Patties you ate during training.
Mr. Krabs	What are you doing Patrick? Don't make me charge you for those patties too!
Mr. Krabs	Not for you! Your tails have to stay here and pay me back some of that money I spent.
Mr. Krabs	I sure hope you're right.
Mr. Krabs	Ah, relax. That's what my grandma's dentures are made of.
Mr. Krabs	Hmm. Is that bad?
Mr. Krabs	So they are! You'll run the register today!  Into the galley with you Mr. Squidward, and start cooking!
Mr. Krabs	You should be the maitre' d! Greeting customers when they come in! Charming the pants off of everyone with your longpants!
Mr. Krabs	A place called... manhood.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, for Pete's sake. Sorry 'bout the legs boyo.
Mr. Krabs	You said everything was free.
Mr. Krabs	Ow!
Mr. Krabs	Nice potbelly!
Mr. Krabs	I think I'm done! Would you mind rubbin' a little butter on me?
Mr. Krabs	'Course it is!  Money makes the world go round, and makes me heart go pound.
Mr. Krabs	Ohh... another lonely evening... dumpin' trash...  ...alone.  Huh?  Umm...  Hello? Miss?
Mr. Krabs	What??  Hey, if I met the scallywag that stood you up, I'd knock him down.  Dooh!
Mr. Krabs	Whoa! Oof!  Allow me.
Mr. Krabs	Wow, what a woman!
Mr. Krabs	Pearl, me little beluga...  I never thought I'd say this, but...  I may have found you a new mom.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, don't worry, sweetie. Nothing will ever come between us.  She's here! Out of me way!  Hello, me little money stack.  I want you to meet me daughter, Pearl.
Mr. Krabs	Hey-hey, you two! How about inviting me into your inside joke? Eh?
Mr. Krabs	Great!  Here's your budget.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, OK. Whatever you want, me sweet. Just ask.
Mr. Krabs	Alright, me sweet. Here it is. (He starts to get emotional) Ugh. I'm gettin' a little emotional. While, I never told anyone the secret... Krabby Patty formula before.  So, here goes.  Erngh.
Mr. Krabs	I've been alone for so long, and for the first time in forever, I felt for someone. Well, I mean something: A pile of cash with lips. It was all too good to be true. Cashina may have not been real, but me feelings were, weren't they?
Mr. Krabs	Yahoo! Oh, this is great news, Pearl, me dear!
Mr. Krabs	That's the spirit.
Mr. Krabs	Spongebob, you shifty sea-slacker, have you counted the cups like i told to do?
Mr. Krabs	All right, you boneless invertebrate lazy bones...  Come on.
Mr. Krabs	Now where's me new fry cook?
Mr. Krabs	And the winner is... SpongeBob Squarepants and the Sharks!
Mr. Krabs	Under where?
Mr. Krabs	Woah! You guys are multiplying faster than me moneys! Alright, pipe down! I'm only gonna tell you the secret formula one more time!
Mr. Krabs	Wait a minute! What's the matter with you, boy?  You like you slept in a pile of trash!
Mr. Krabs	What'd you catch?
Mr. Krabs	No, SpongeBob, we are not handing out anything free with every purchase! Even the smiles here cost a nickel.
Mr. Krabs	Look out, Mr. Squidward, I'll teach ya how to run a cash register.
Mr. Krabs	"""Unless you give a tiny copepod the Krabby Patty secret formula, you will die?!"""
Mr. Krabs	Me money!
Mr. Krabs	Well, I figured the funeral fortune was phony Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	"""Lonely Krab Dinner for One: Now 30% lonelier."" Eee, can't believe what they're charging for this frozen debris, and I can't believe they're selling so much of it. But it sure is convenient."
Mr. Krabs	So, Mr. Grouper, what do you think?
Mr. Krabs	Ooh. Okay.
Mr. Krabs	Don, will this commercial really help me make money?
Mr. Krabs	What? Forget what? What? What?! What are you saying?
Mr. Krabs	Heh, no, I-I can well, it's just a little tweak, me boy.
Mr. Krabs	"Well, it's imported. It's spelled ""sand"" but it's pronounced, ""filler."""
Mr. Krabs	Yes, yes, we can.
Mr. Krabs	No, ever.
Mr. Krabs	Then follow me.
Mr. Krabs	You see? Customers at the museum can cook the patties themselves, like this.
Mr. Krabs	Heh! No, you're just fired.
Mr. Krabs	And here to say a few words is the face of the Frozen Krabby Patty, our own Patrick Star. Come on up, Patrick!
Mr. Krabs	That's strange.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, did you do all this?
Mr. Krabs	No, no I
Mr. Krabs	Agh, SpongeBob, me boy, you've done a good thing here, lad, but you could use a little frelp, I think.  How about we partner up, and I become your boss and pay you minimum wage while I work you mercilessly? What do you say?
Mr. Krabs	Well, you're more than welcome to go to each table and tell them about your satisfactory experience.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, everybody! Our community bulletin board is here! Tell your friends and come on down and use it for the good of me business! Me wallet! Me... I mean the community.
Mr. Krabs	Not on my bulletin board!
Mr. Krabs	Alright, that's a good one. Heh, heh. Hey, you know all this note-writing must be making you folks hungry. We have a short line at the register.
Mr. Krabs	That's not true!
Mr. Krabs	Tastes like old baseball gloves, do they?
Mr. Krabs	Okay, that's it! Everybody out!
Mr. Krabs	This is Maddaddy. I read you, Pineapple1. Any movement?
Mr. Krabs	Well, I'm still angry and I need somethin' to calm me down! Ooh!  This knittin' circle oughta do the trick. And you all are joining me! Especially you, Delicate Flower.
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward! Food Con is the biggest convention of food fans in the entire ocean!  The best chefs and cooks gather together and compete for the top prize: The GoldenCornucopia!
Mr. Krabs	Ta da!
Mr. Krabs	We are not stoppin' 'til we get to Food Con!
Mr. Krabs	Not a peep!
Mr. Krabs	Maybe I could just eat a pickle.
Mr. Krabs	"Did I say ""soothe""? I guess I meant enrages."
Mr. Krabs	Ok, just do it already!
Mr. Krabs	I think mine is mostly stones!
Mr. Krabs	Well, in that case, you leave me no choice. Get him!!!
Mr. Krabs	Get him!
Mr. Krabs	What's all the racket out here?
Mr. Krabs	Why you little...
Mr. Krabs	Whew! That was too close my lad. Three more safes and he would've had me secret formula.
Mr. Krabs	Take this home with ya and hide it while I reevaluate my security situation.
Mr. Krabs	You'll never get me secret Krabby Patty formula, Plankton! Adios!
Mr. Krabs	Just a minute. I think I've perfected the Krabby Patty formula!  Yes! That's it!
Mr. Krabs	Here you go, Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	You've finally been schooled, drop-out!
Mr. Krabs	As soon as you buy some patties to go, you can go.
Mr. Krabs	Listen up, everybody! New store policy! All money brought into this store must be spent here!
Mr. Krabs	Darn arthritis!
Mr. Krabs	This is mutiny! Listen here, Squidward! Fun is fun, but get me outta here!
Mr. Krabs	Whoa! Man overboard!
Mr. Krabs	And that's comin' out of your pay!
Mr. Krabs	I don't care.
Mr. Krabs	Oh yeah? What's that?
Mr. Krabs	Come on! It starts with a T!
Mr. Krabs	Hold on to me dime, boy-yo.
Mr. Krabs	You, Ex-Captain Squidward, have gone from pay day to mayday! Mush! Every last one of ya! All the way back to Bikini Bottom!
Mr. Krabs	I lost me bet!
Mr. Krabs	Come here, you.
Mr. Krabs	Hello?  Mr. Squidward, step into me office.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, it's deeper than that.
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy, you high-sea halfwits!
Mr. Krabs	What are you waiting for?
Mr. Krabs	Ha! See? I just stole some money!
Mr. Krabs	And then we can play?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, yeah! Thanks old timer! Um, we're pretending to rob this bank. Where's the tellers? Where's the money?
Mr. Krabs	Eh, okay, Squidward. Playtime's over. This is getting a little intense here.
Mr. Krabs	Open the doors and let the consuming commence! I'll be in me office polishing yesterday's booty.
Mr. Krabs	Well, you got me there. I do love money.  Excellent observation, Mr. Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	The salty tear trail leads right in here.
Mr. Krabs	Sure, SpongeBob, I got it right  Oh, no, you don't, Plankton!
Mr. Krabs	If customers find out you're touching patties with your wormy hands, the health department will shut us down for sure.
Mr. Krabs	Oh! That's the last straw! Mr. Squid
Mr. Krabs	Any ideas?
Mr. Krabs	Hey, I'm not paying you to play hide-and-seek! These children want to be entertained! Get down here!
Mr. Krabs	Me money! Do I look like a piata to you, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Yes.
Mr. Krabs	Tuxedos? Oh, just give us a moment to suit up, me good lady.
Mr. Krabs	We are anything we need to be for me to make this money.
Mr. Krabs	Hmm, you might be right. SpongeBob, go find something to fancy-up the food.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, kid, easy, easy. Just calm down, will ya? I got your cake.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, were those jewels on the patties?
Mr. Krabs	Okay.
Mr. Krabs	Give me those! Young boy like yourself shouldn't be playing with fireworks. They're too dangerous.
Mr. Krabs	Um, yes, ma'am?
Mr. Krabs	Ooh-ee. That is one bigwater bed?
Mr. Krabs	Get over here!
Mr. Krabs	Barrel roll, four somersaults!
Mr. Krabs	Whoa!
Mr. Krabs	Is there something wrong with your sandwich, sir?
Mr. Krabs	Huh?
Mr. Krabs	Don't you believe in ghosts?
Mr. Krabs	What? What's wrong with them?
Mr. Krabs	Now go ahead! Call attention to me!
Mr. Krabs	Ha-ha!  It was  who cooked those patties! You're all enjoying my food!
Mr. Krabs	Ahh! Ow! Eee! Hey! Oh! Whoa! Ah! Blazes!
Mr. Krabs	Stop! Stop here!
Mr. Krabs	You deserve your own place.
Mr. Krabs	Huh?
Mr. Krabs	You know, I know of an empty restaurant that's got all its papers in order. We can move in right away.
Mr. Krabs	You know, I've been doing some thinking. You're a big part of this place, boy-o, and I believe I should share the name with you.  Take a gander.
Mr. Krabs	No!
Mr. Krabs	That's not how life insurance works.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, hey there, boyo! Lovely day for a boat wash!  Isn't it?
Mr. Krabs	The hooks! The hooks!

Mr. Krabs	Yow! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!
Mr. Krabs	Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs	Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you lade?
Mr. Krabs	Uhh...lad?
Mr. Krabs	Gotcha!
Mr. Krabs	Pull!
Mr. Krabs	Gotcha.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, ha ha!  All hands on deck, SpongeBob!

Mr. Krabs	You see? He's got an evil belt to match those evil shoes!
Mr. Krabs	Ooh.
Mr. Krabs	Oh-oh, sure. Whatever you say, old-timer. How would you be doing that when you're all the way over here in Dullsville, hmm?

Mr. Krabs	Thanks, Doc.
Mr. Krabs	Why, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Me money never looked better. Thanks, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	Thanks, buddy!
Mr. Krabs	Wow, that's impressive.
Mr. Krabs	You may know me daughter Pearl. She's growing up fast.  It seems like it was just yesterday I was teaching her how to breach. Me mammalian angel. Oh...  Anyway, uh, so she's going to be working here during her summer vacation. She's got a lot of fresh ideas to bring in some hungry customers!
Mr. Krabs	It makes me jolly as a roger to have you finally aboard the family business!
Mr. Krabs	Come on in, me boy! Have a seat.
Mr. Krabs	How about my cuddly executive buddy?  Reduces stress for only five easy payments of $9.95.
Mr. Krabs	You could fire her! It's ok if she hates you.
Mr. Krabs	Don't be too hard on her, now. Why does it have to be this way?  It's for the best.
Mr. Krabs	Really?
Mr. Krabs	Not FREE!
Mr. Krabs	No money, eh?
Mr. Krabs	Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe.  Even if you quit.
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	He owes me money!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, Nickel Buddy, I'll never spend you!
Mr. Krabs	Just fooling sonny, and besides, why would I start saying no to free labor now?
Mr. Krabs	Buy some, buy some, buy some Krabby Patties! Buy some, buy some, buy some Krabby Patties! Remember the plaidy patty? Painted up so nice! You'll like me newest patty more, it's frozen up in ice.
Mr. Krabs	No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day.
Mr. Krabs	After you present your brotherhood gift.
Mr. Krabs	Not yet. I got to make sure you did it right.  Wait a second... this would go great with some milk!  So, you tried to kill me over a little new aged management, eh?
Mr. Krabs	You had to kill him. The boy cries you a sweater of tears and you kill him. How are you gonna live with yourself?
Mr. Krabs	Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours.
Mr. Krabs	Quit fooling around, SpongeBob, we got customers.
Mr. Krabs	That Plankton is a clever beast. You've got to keep a sharp eye out for him, SpongeBob. The Krabby Patty law must be enforced. The future of the Krusty Krab depends on it.
Mr. Krabs	That's no reason to rip other people's heads off, boy! Just remember the most important rule.
Mr. Krabs	What is today, but yesterday's tomorrow?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	That sound, it sounds like... the pitter-patter of...  money!  Hey, where you going, beautiful?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, no! Don't listen to him. I'm the real Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs	Okay then.
Mr. Krabs	That's an easy one. You just...just... let's see... if its..uh.. if it's January... with...with vanilla pudding...you...uh...pass?  Wait, SpongeBob! Give me another chance.
Mr. Krabs	Phew, that's okay, me lad. Long as the secret formula's safe again.  However, that penny's coming out of your paycheck.
Mr. Krabs	So I can open me latest money maker, The Krusty Pool!
Mr. Krabs	What the barnacles? It suddenly got a little warm in here!  Who turned up the hea...?  SpongeBob, what are you doing?
Mr. Krabs	All me customers have moved to cooler climates.
Mr. Krabs	"""Money!"""
Mr. Krabs	Now just 'cause you swabs haven't seen a creature like this doesn't mean it's dangerous.
Mr. Krabs	Please settle down.  We've got a situation in there. I'd rather not discuss 'till me manager gets here.
Mr. Krabs	Money.
Mr. Krabs	Yes. Well, anyway... The new manager is a loyal, hard-working employee.
Mr. Krabs	Please welcome our new manager...Squidward Tentacles!
Mr. Krabs	You... did not... get... the job.
Mr. Krabs	No, wait, that's not right. Not a dork.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	What's this? King Neptune is riding toward the Krusty Krab at lunchtime! He's got money!
Mr. Krabs	"""I stole your crown. Signed, Eugene Krabs?!"""
Mr. Krabs	Wait, Neptune! Please, I'm begging you! I ain't a crook! Ask anyone, they'll vouch for me!
Mr. Krabs	Ooh! Me pants are on fire! Me underwear's on fire! I'm on fire!  Oh, yeah.
Mr. Krabs	13, 14, 15...
Mr. Krabs	Don't worry, little formula. You'll be safe in this...safe.  Fire!
Mr. Krabs	Money?  Thank you. Come again.
Mr. Krabs	Sounds to me like someone's just a wee bit...broke!
Mr. Krabs	It sure does, boy.  Why don't you scurry along?  Thanks for coming! Have a nice day!  He's been out there crying for twenty minutes.  Pathetic.  I'm just gonna go out there and gloat a little.
Mr. Krabs	A robot?!
Mr. Krabs	Where's me formuler, Plankton?!
Mr. Krabs	Knock-Knock.
Mr. Krabs	Hehehehe... You'll see.
Mr. Krabs	Curse you, fine print!!
Mr. Krabs	Not now, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Enough with that niceties, Plankton! This is the last time I'm gonna ask you.
Mr. Krabs	Soap in the eye, eh? Diabolical.
Mr. Krabs	So, you've been runnin' a long con on me, eh? All these years, you've been working for Plankton?!
Mr. Krabs	But SpongeBob, me most trusted employee, working with me sworn enemy?  You know what this means, Mr. Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	LET'S GO GET HIM!!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, is that me formuler?  Oh, happy day.  I've missed you so much. Where was it? Where'd you find it?
Mr. Krabs	Let the sacrifice begin!
Mr. Krabs	I smell 'em, too. Ok SpongeBob, Go Get It!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, this guy just wants a free lunch.
Mr. Krabs	All hands on deck!
Mr. Krabs	What the--?
Mr. Krabs	What story?
Mr. Krabs	Incoming!
Mr. Krabs	Ah!
Mr. Krabs	Finest under the sea!
Mr. Krabs	Money walking! I need to think up a gimmick like that to bring customers back in here!
Mr. Krabs	Why can't someone give me an idea?
Mr. Krabs	Great Barrier Reef! That patty's spoiled!
Mr. Krabs	Wait! Gimme an orange patty... with extra purple!
Mr. Krabs	How can you make money with such a stupid idea?
Mr. Krabs	I've never had a line.
Mr. Krabs	I bet you miss Squidward... and the grill. And the crow's nest.
Mr. Krabs	No! I've got a better idea! I'll take this old roadside stand off your hands. For keeps. An in exchange, I'll give you the Krusty Krab. With Squidward, the grill, and all those squeaky pickles!
Mr. Krabs	Don't worry, boy! I'll fix it! Get this to the Krusty Krab on the double! Good luck, lad!
Mr. Krabs	Wha-!?! Who? What?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, let me in! SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Or I'll feel your life with misery and woe.
Mr. Krabs	Earrings! Well, Cashy, I guess the Devil's Galley isn't so bad. As long as that Flying Dutchman doesnt appear and stick us in Davy Jones' Locker! But that won't happen, will it Cashy?
Mr. Krabs	WHAT?!
Mr. Krabs	Man the lifeboats!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, that's where I rent me pickles from.
Mr. Krabs	Well, I, uh...
Mr. Krabs	Oh, they're...
Mr. Krabs	Ah, permission shmermission! You can borrow anything you want, anytime, as long as if you give it back  before it's missed.  Everyone knows that! Right?
Mr. Krabs	I dunno about you, lubbers, but any fella who's giving away free stuff, is a friend o' mine.
Mr. Krabs	A pony.
Mr. Krabs	Okay, everybody settle down. Welcome  to the Komedy Krab!  Now please give a warm welcome to our first comic, the indiscernible Dougie Williams.
Mr. Krabs	The headliner's the one who cleans up after the show.
Mr. Krabs	It's true, I am cheap!
Mr. Krabs	It's free!
Mr. Krabs	Wait, boy!  Make it last.
Mr. Krabs	Three cheers for feeling sorry for ourselves! Hip hip!
Mr. Krabs	Aha! Top of the mornin', boys!  Next stop: gift shop.
Mr. Krabs	Come on SpongeBob, it's quittin' time.  I've got a card game tonight.
Mr. Krabs	I lost.
Mr. Krabs	I lost...  you!
Mr. Krabs	I'm sorry, boy! It's all my fault!
Mr. Krabs	A patty is a patty, that's what I say.
Mr. Krabs	It's just a greasy spoon
Mr. Krabs	How 'bout... you give me fifty bucks, and I'll take him off your hands.
Mr. Krabs	That's what I thought you said.
Mr. Krabs	Aye, he's been trying to steal me secret formula for years. But you haven't got it yet, have ye bug?  Okay.  Enough lad, it wasn't that funny.  Get back to work!
Mr. Krabs	So when do we get the free food?
Mr. Krabs	I think I'm gonna be sick.
Mr. Krabs	See ya in the morning, boys! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life.
Mr. Krabs	It's money that paid for all them renovations we did!  Oh, nothing in all the seven seas could matter more. Not even that...  ...scrumptious curvy cutie.
Mr. Krabs	Then what happened to Mr. Puff?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, no, wait! I'm too nervous! Ooohhh...

Mr. Krabs	Oh, SpongeBob! I couldn't help but spend every cent I had on her! I couldn't control myself!
Mr. Krabs	You come with me on the date and don't let me spend any money!
Mr. Krabs	It's me, my beautiful bell buoy!
Mr. Krabs	Hurry, boy! Get the flowers!
Mr. Krabs	Of course, my beautiful Puff.
Mr. Krabs	For you, Mrs. Puff!
Mr. Krabs	Buy, buy, buy! Spend, spend, spend! Is that all you can think about?!
Mr. Krabs	The sun's beatin' down on poor Mrs. Puff's head!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, hurry!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, I'm sorry. This is my fault. I'm not thinking clearly. I'm making a sailor's promise, boy. From this moment on, I won't ask you to buy anything for Mrs. Puff!
Mr. Krabs	You're breaking me boy!  She needs fine jewelry!  Not that fine!  SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Please lad, I'm begging you! I'm a lonely old crustacean who's found love! Don't let me lose her!
Mr. Krabs	Uh, OK.
Mr. Krabs	Hold on there, SpongeBob!  Take that pile of filth out with you.
Mr. Krabs	Huh?  SpongeBob and friend! Front and center! Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!
Mr. Krabs	Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use.
Mr. Krabs	What, what, what?
Mr. Krabs	Yes?!
Mr. Krabs	Do my ears deceive me?! You two should be ashamed! Time to take out the trash.  You two need to be taught a lesson. I thought I made it clear. Never, and I mean, never use number 11 or any of the 13 bad words! Now the both of youse wait right here. I'll be back.
Mr. Krabs	!
Mr. Krabs	Mother!
Mr. Krabs	Messing with the patty's formula, that's mutiny! Why I oughta...!
Mr. Krabs	Now go get me some jellyfish, and make it  ...quick. Uhh, SpongeBob? We're gonna need more than one puny jellyfish.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I'll keep 'em comfortable all right, inside me wallet!
Mr. Krabs	More, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	That's it, boys! Keep that gelatinous gold mine flowing!
Mr. Krabs	No!
Mr. Krabs	You'll never catch me!  Blasted exercise craze!
Mr. Krabs	What's that smell in the air? I smell Plankton!
Mr. Krabs	Look at him. In his prime. You ain't got no chance!
Mr. Krabs	He's making a mockery of your profession. Are we gonna let some pretender take away what belongs to the Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs	Medal!
Mr. Krabs	Hey! Where ya going?
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Breathe on your own time. I don't pay you to breathe.
Mr. Krabs	And here's yours, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	You mean you're going to make picket signs?
Mr. Krabs	But they didn't, did they, Mr. Squidward? 'Cause they were too busy eating out of mine. I wish you two had gone on strike earlier. Thanks for attracting all these paying customers with all your signage and your sloganeering!
Mr. Krabs	Yes, anything. So what do you say, Mr. Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Now I can fire them teenagers and get me two golden boys back. Well, see you at work!
Mr. Krabs	I've got it! Let's all buy a Krabby Patty!
Mr. Krabs	No! You'll never get a cent out of me!  Never! I'd rather that worm come in here right now and eat you all alive!  Sorry.
Mr. Krabs	And he's finally got a Krabby Patty! Ar, ar, ar, ar!
Mr. Krabs	Enjoy your victory screech, Plankton, because someday the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!
Mr. Krabs	What's with all the ruckus?  A monster scaring away me customers!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, thanks for finally getting rid of that horse!
Mr. Krabs	Well, keep working on it! That was terrible!
Mr. Krabs	So, my eyes are correct! You still have that horse even when I ordered you to get rid of it! Well, now I'm going to get rid of it once and for all!
Mr. Krabs	[sniffles] And one day at the beach, it was so hot and I was so thirsty! I spent it on a soda!  My best friend (crying)!
Mr. Krabs	Get that horse!
Mr. Krabs	We're doomed.
Mr. Krabs	Fresh Sludge Pudding?
Mr. Krabs	Free food?!
Mr. Krabs	That's not even a word, and I agree with ya!  Look at him. I bet he never changes his underwear.
Mr. Krabs	Well, fish it out, and I'll dry it with me gym socks!  Why that's the most diabolical Krabby Patty ever spawned!
Mr. Krabs	Because that patty killed him!
Mr. Krabs	Get a hold of yourself, boy. We've got to get rid of this body before anyone sees it. We've got to take it out and bury it.
Mr. Krabs	Well toss it out and get back to diggin'!
Mr. Krabs	They don't need air where he's going.
Mr. Krabs	And what would be the charges?
Mr. Krabs	Why?  Put it in the trunk, boy! I'll keep them cops busy!
Mr. Krabs	Now listen, SpongeBob, when we get to the Krusty Krab, I want you to take that  shovel and bring it around to the back entrance and stuff...err, I mean, stow it in the freezer. Understand?
Mr. Krabs	Okey dokey, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Ice? Ice? You want ice? Is that what you want? You want ice? Is that what you want?
Mr. Krabs	He was insane! Out of control! He would've killed me too if you two hadn't come along.
Mr. Krabs	We killed the health inspector! Buried him and then stuffed his body in the freezer!
Mr. Krabs	Come on, everybody. Krabby Patties at half price! Well, not really.
Mr. Krabs	A buck-50 for that? But it's an antique! It belonged to a queen. Ten bucks.
Mr. Krabs	Ah, the sweet smell of an all-day sucker.
Mr. Krabs	Five bucks.
Mr. Krabs	"This hat says, ""Hey, I'm number 1, and I let gravity do my drinking."" This hat was made for you, boy.  You were born to wear this hat."
Mr. Krabs	Well, I guess it's no deal.
Mr. Krabs	Yes, I am.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!  There he is with me million dollar hat. I gotta get it back before he finds out how much it's worth.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, well, um... you're... you're beautiful.  Uh... heh-heh.  All right, now give me the hat back.
Mr. Krabs	Not sick of that boring old hat, yet?
Mr. Krabs	Well, then I guess you don't want to see what's in my bag.
Mr. Krabs	Foxy Grandpa?  So, what do you say? Your silly hat for all these hats?
Mr. Krabs	Now, listen, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	Uh... Smitty something.
Mr. Krabs	Immediately...
Mr. Krabs	Ahh! SpongeBob! What are you doing here?
Mr. Krabs	"Huh?  Ahh! Hold yourself together, Krabs. It's just a boneyard... filled with bones.  Ah!  What's that? It's Squidward. What's he doing here?  ""Here lies Squidward's hopes and dreams."" What a baby. Where was I? Oh yeah. Gotta find Smitty Whatsajipster.  Nope. Nope. No. No. No. Uh-uh... No. Not there.  I've checked every headstone in this cemetery and there's no Smitty Wabbablabba buried here. Think, Krabs. Maybe something SpongeBob said will give you some type of clue."
Mr. Krabs	Ah!! Barnacles! I'll never find--  The grave! Am I really going to defile this grave for money? Of course I am!  Jackpot!  Ooh. It's beautiful. Come to papa.  Hey, come on, Smitty, let go!  Rest in pieces, Smitty.  I got the million dollar hat.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no. I've seen this on the late show. You ghoulish fiends hold me down and take turns nibbling on my innards. Then you eat my brain and leave my body for the buzzards.
Mr. Krabs	Well, that's a spirit breaker.
Mr. Krabs	What in Neptune's name is going on?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, well, then how do you explain that?  A 2nd Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs	What are you talking about, Squidward? We got the cheapest crew in the world. You, me, and SpongeBob. Speaking of which, where is the little barnacle?
Mr. Krabs	Don't throw your buts at me, Mr. Squidward. We got a timetable to keep. This thing airs tonight.
Mr. Krabs	Why, we're at none other than the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs	We start with a fresh patty, grilled and juicy. Add some crisp undersea veggies and cheese. Topped off with secret sauce and some buns. Voila! A Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs	There you are, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	The only thing you better lay is some patties on the grill, Fry Boy.
Mr. Krabs	Oooooh... I've never felt such a strange combination of pity... and indigestion.
Mr. Krabs	Perhaps, one of our more loyal workers can enlighten you on company policy.
Mr. Krabs	Hmmm, are you prepared to say that with your hand on top of a stack of interpretive dance quarterlies?
Mr. Krabs	Well, the way I see it there are three possibilities: One, you stole it. Two, you stole it? Or three, you stole it!
Mr. Krabs	You, you can't do that to me! I'm your boss!
Mr. Krabs	You can't put a price on me first dime! And I can't forgive that thieving bilge rat, Squidward for stealing it!
Mr. Krabs	Aye, lad, just let the dime and me have our privacy.
Mr. Krabs	After all I'm sure ya didn't mean to misplace me dime.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, we'll see you after your lunch break, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Scrih- Scray- Screh- Squilliam?  That guy who made millions doing what you wish you could do?
Mr. Krabs	Peas!  Made 'em the old-fashioned way.
Mr. Krabs	Run for your lives, everyone! It's the appetizer!
Mr. Krabs	I feel completely recharged!
Mr. Krabs	"The one that goes ""bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep."""
Mr. Krabs	Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious?
Mr. Krabs	I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!
Mr. Krabs	What is it, SpongeBob?!
Mr. Krabs	Ahhh! Oh, my eyes!
Mr. Krabs	Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?!
Mr. Krabs	I'm Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs	That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs	No! That cost me $24.95!
Mr. Krabs	I loved it like it was me own.
Mr. Krabs	Huh?
Mr. Krabs	Special...?
Mr. Krabs	The two of you are to paint the inside of me house!
Mr. Krabs	You both look like you got a dirty little secret. Ha! I'm kidding. Let's see how you did. Oh, not bad boys, not bad. A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own.  That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar...  ...rama!  All the dolls in this dollarama were perfectly aligned!
Mr. Krabs	Get down onto the floor, boy.  Alright, now you're just being silly.
Mr. Krabs	All right boys, you know what I've got to do now?
Mr. Krabs	Nah, I just like to mess with ya!  The old man's still got it!  Aww, crud, I really gotta learn to say it, not spray it.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, give me a break, Mr. Complainsalot! As if you would know anything about running a restaurant!
Mr. Krabs	This is mutiny! And the public is actually eating it! Well, at least our loyal clientele haven't jumped on the chum wagon.
Mr. Krabs	Say, kiddo, why don't see if you can't get old Kenny and his throng of fans to visit the old Krusty Krab for a while?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, me boy! It's time to give them a crash course in Krabby Patty making.
Mr. Krabs	Oh really?  Then what do you call?... this?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, you sure? She's no myth! She's as real as Santy Claus. Back when I was young sea captain,  sailing in the Atlantic sea.[???]
Mr. Krabs	Trademarked by Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs	So, uhh, how's it going, Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Well how are you gonna make Krabby Patties WITHOUT A SPATULA?!
Mr. Krabs	Ho-ho, no he didn't, boy! Don't you know whats behind these screens? Solid concrete!
Mr. Krabs	Why don't I, but...hmm...one sec.  Time for a scary story boys. The story......of the Main Drain.  Patrick.
Narrator	Sounds like a lot of...
Narrator	"All of this modernization seems a little overwhelming, doesn't it?  Well luckily for you, Mr. Krabs fear of robot overlords keeps the balance of technology in check.  But if modernization is the heart of the Krusty Krab, then employees are the liver and gallbladder.  Let's see if you got what it takes. Hmmm, poised, confident, and a smile that says, ""Hello world! May I take your order?"" You've got the makings of a good employee, Mr. SquarePants! But for every good employee, there is one who is not so good.  Let's see, inattentive, impatient, a glazed look in the eyes.  Look carefully at the ""I Really Wish I Weren't Here Right Now!"" button. There's a name for employees like this, but we'll call him Squidward."
Narrator	Once you understand POOP, you'll understand your place at the Krusty Krab. But what does POOP mean?  It's actually a carefully organized code. Watch closely. People Order Our Patties.
Narrator	Ah, POOP! You never let us down!  Now that you understand POOP, I bet you think you're ready to make a Krabby Patty.
Narrator	Don't worry Squidward, Mr. SquarePants can cover for you.  Now that your workstation is up and running, perhaps you think you're ready to make the world-famous Krabby Patty.  Calm down.  There's plenty of time left. We have to make sure you're ready for the psychological aspect of the job:  Interfacing with your Boss.
Narrator	Like precious, precious blood in an animal, the customer is what makes the Krusty Krab strong and alive.
Narrator	He's stealing the formula! What are you going to do, Mr. SquarePants?
Narrator	Hang in there Squidward, it's all part of the job.  Now that you've learned the basics of your training, it's time for the moment you've been waiting for.  Preparing the Krabby Patty!  At the center of every great dynasty is the crown jewel which keeps it alive and thriving.  For the Krusty Krab, this is the Krabby Patty.  And now you, the humble employee off the street, the all-too-necessary human resource that keeps this business afloat, will learn the sacred and dark secrets of how to prepare, with your very own hands...  the sumptuousness, lip-moistening, spine-tingling, heart-stopping pleasure center that is a Krabby Patty! Are you ready?  Are you sure?  Okay! The secret formula i-
Narrator	Ah, the Barg'n Mart. A consumer's paradise of brand-like items, stocked as far as the eye can see.
Narrator	Thank you for coming to SpongeBob's House Party!
Narrator	The Quickster...with the ability to run really...quick!
Narrator	And Miss Appear...now you see her...  ...now you don't.
Narrator	Meanwhile.
Narrator	Will Patchy ever get control of the special?  What will SpongeBob do with fire?  Stay tuned to SpongeBob SquarePants B.C. and find out!
Narrator	Perhaps certain events in history are better left untold.
Narrator	Later...
Narrator	Six hours later
Narrator	Several days later.
Narrator	Gentle rhythm!  Oh, never mind.
Narrator	One minute thirty seven seconds later...
Narrator	Today, SpongeBob has learned one of the sea's harshest lessons: wild animals can throw very wild parties.  Ooh, I felt that.
Narrator	And so kids, always remember to follow your dreams, unless you're Patchy, and just stay in bed.
Narrator	It is a cold and windy day, and Bikini Bottom is covered with goosebumps.
Narrator	The machine wanted his job to make SpongeBob quit. But SpongeBob didn't like it. No, not one bit. Pushing his grill, SpongeBob burst through the door.
Narrator	They cheered full of glee. All except Patrick, who had to go pee.
Narrator	Yelled out Squidward.
Narrator	But SpongeBob cried out...
Narrator	Lightning flew from its maw. It looked ready to burst. But SpongeBob, still standing, yelled...
Narrator	What's that? You thought SpongeBob was buried down there? They just buried the gadget. Ha-ha, this I swear.  Well, that ends me tale, straight from the book. Now I gotta go and polish me hook!
Narrator	Ten seconds later.
Narrator	Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy  have been captured by the evil Man Ray.  ... Tickled to the point of wetting themselves   and sent on a conveyor belt of doom...  To their watery grave.
Narrator	"Opening Night"". We then see an actual red curtain and stage lights at the dock. We see 3 chairs in the front of it. They all sit down."
Narrator	Three weeks later...
Narrator	Two hours later.
Narrator	Perhaps not, Monsieur Krabs, for it's...  SpongeBob SquarePants!
Narrator	Ah, learning how to surf. To some it comes as easily as eating an ice cream cone on a hot day.
Narrator	And sometimes, it's the retreat.
Narrator	But all in all, in life, it's not whether we win or lose, but whether we get totally stoked.
Narrator	For the first time, we learn about these legendary superheroes' origins, and their rise to stardom. Tomorrow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy will appear in the flesh signing their new books!
Narrator	Ah. Another quiet day in Bikini Bottom. But it wasn't always this way. Once, it was horrible.  The unimaginable happened. One day, SpongeBob SquarePants... changed his pants!  I remember it as if it were yesterday. But, in fact, in happened three days ago.
Narrator	Shady Shoals, mild mannered rest home and secret headquarters of Mermaid Man - Master of maritime justice and defender of Bikini Bottom.
Narrator	But wait, what's this? Why, it's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's biggest fans. SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star.
Narrator	Several song-filled hours later...
Narrator	Two Hours Later.
Narrator	15 minutes later...
Narrator	Thousands of tears later...
Narrator	Ah, the eternal expanse of the deep sea. Teeming with fantastic creatures. Uh, teeming Im sure theyre around here somewhere! Aha!  Oh, thats a rock! Where is everybody?   Oh, it is just SpongeBob. Watch and witness one of the rarest and mysterious rituals of the deep, the staring contest.
Narrator	Many Hours Later...
Narrator	2,000 years later...
Narrator	One wiener later...
Narrator	The first day of spring in Bikini Bottom. The flowers are blooming, the rainbows are... how you say? Bowing. The jellyfish are buzzing,  and it's time for the traditional...
Narrator	Early the next morning...
Narrator	Two weeks later...
Narrator	Johnny Krill! Not Dead Ted!  Grand Moul Granny!  Drastic... Radicals!  The drasticals!
Narrator	Ah, Goo Lagoon. A relaxing retreat for the citizens of Bikini Bottom.  A place for fun and frolic, but soon fun shall turn to fear,  for deadly danger creeps their way  and it came from Goo Lagoon.
Narrator	One hour later...
Narrator	And now, Astrology with Squidward.
Narrator	And now, Astrology with Squidward.
Narrator	Ahh, Bikini Bottom, fresh city to go to and what next, let's go.
Narrator	And all the toons in ToonVille say
Narrator	The Krusty Krab has been shelling out quality service with its signature Krabby Patty is the sizzling source of revenue. Mr. Krabs has served over 50 billion aquatic customers.
Narrator	Ah, Bikini Bottom. Home to the friendliest creatures under the sea.
Narrator	You know you are from Bikini Bottom when... this is customer service.
Narrator	Or a stone head, or a treedome, or a rock.
Narrator	Good, 'cause this city-slicker necktie has got to go.  And this hat...ridiculous.  Now all you need is some uncut facial hair , a handlebar mustache , a scar ...
Narrator	What if SpongeBob was gone?
Narrator	Welcome to Bikini Bottom, where can be found some of the finest specimens of undersea life.  Well, you know.
Narrator	Things to do when encountering a legendary creature.
Narrator	Well, that was unexpected.
Narrator	But wherever there's a secret recipe, there is someone who wants to steal it.
Narrator	Ah, Sandy Cheeks is going out of town and has asked SpongeBob and Patrick to do a little pet-sitting for her.
Narrator	Ask Patrick Anything!
Narrator	Told ya. He knows everything.
Narrator	Hmm, probably not the answer you expected. Now viewer, think of a really big question. Ready, Set, Ask!
Narrator	Umm, that was... Ask Patrick Anything!
Narrator	"Number 1: ""Setting boundaries"""
Narrator	"Number 4: ""Affirmation"""
Narrator	"Number 7: ""Compassion"""
Narrator	This is where everyone's favorite underwater hero, SpongeBob SquarePants, is animated. Let's go in and check it out.
Narrator	While this is happening, the background artists are painting all the backgrounds that are needed for this episode.
Narrator	And now, direct from Encino, America's favorite pirate and president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate.
Narrator	Ah, ze early morning in Bikini Bottom, when the jellyfish are buzzing about and making their jellyfish jelly.  Oh, what is happening here?  Collectors?
Narrator	Free drinks...
Narrator	And now the host of You Wish. He's got puffy and better loons then Captain Kidd, and fuzzier facial hair then Black Beard. He's America's favorite Pirate, Patchy of Encino.
Narrator	Day two.
Narrator	A few moments later...
Narrator	Ah, springtime in Bikini Bottom. All sea creatures have an innate sense of the seasonal changes...  ...like the starfish. A quick survey of his environment...  ...and he knows that.
Narrator	Twelve seconds later...
Narrator	Ahh, the Krusty Krab. Through these doors pass all the many kinds of undersea life.
Narrator	For Mr. Krabs, all trash is treasure.
Narrator	Three weeks later...
Narrator	Tomorrow...
Narrator	Uhhh...
Narrator	One hour later...
Narrator	Ah, the sea... so fascinating. So wonderful. Here, we see Bikini Bottom, teeming with life.  Home to one of my favorite creatures, SpongeBob SquarePants. Yes, of course he lives in a pineapple, you silly.
Narrator	Remembering SpongeBob.
Narrator	Today,  we study the gentle of rhythm of the sea.
Narrator	3 hours later--
Narrator	One frozen wasteland later.
Narrator	One week later....
Narrator	Flashback...
Narrator	The next day...
Narrator	Pushed by Mr. Krabs, whose desires blind him to the pain he influenced. In short, this whole trip is beginning to look like a whoopsie.
Narrator	"Uh-oh. It looks as if the domesticated snail has unintentionally deformed the word ""Frying."" Making it look like the word ""Flying."" This is probably going to be a problem later on."
Narrator	4 to 6 more days later...
Narrator	More moments later...
Narrator	Would you please stop imitating me? It is starting to get very annoying.
Narrator	Later...
Narrator	The next morning...
Narrator	And now, some simple guidelines from your visit to Jellyfish Fields. Always pack lightly.  Dispose of litter properly.
Narrator	This message is brought to you by Nickelodeon and BBC Earth.
Narrator	Later that evening...
Narrator	We rejoin the artist in a creative slump.
Narrator	Ahh, another beautiful day in Bikini Bottom's own Jellyfish Fields. An untamed world of natural order where the little jellyfish jellies roam free across the salty seascape. And where there is jellyfish, there is the Jellyfish Hunter.
Narrator	Two hours later...
Patrick	No you're not. You're going to the Krusty Krab and get that job!
Patrick	Who's a, uh who's uhh. oh! who's a big yellow cube with holes?
Patrick	Who's ready?
Patrick	Who said that? Are you a ghost?
Patrick	The ceiling is right Squidward, you're not a very good employee.
Patrick	Me neither.
Patrick	Thanks.
Patrick	Kcirtap si eman ym o77eh. I don't get it.
Patrick	Was he talking to me or you?
Patrick	So, do you come here often?
Patrick	Okay, hold on.  SpongeBob, you out here? Phone's for you!
Patrick	That was the greatest party any of us have ever been to!
Patrick	Hey, the mail's here! What did you get?
Patrick	Uh...  More time for thinking.
Patrick	Yes sir. With or without nuts?
Patrick	He said we were mediocre...
Patrick	I love you.
Patrick	I'll take 10!
Patrick	Did you say something?
Patrick	I can't understand anything
Patrick	Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth, they wouldn't sell as many.
Patrick	Hooray for lying!
Patrick	You'll walk through walls!
Patrick	No! Don't hurt us, Tom. Please Spare Me!
Patrick	I do!
Patrick	Does this mean we're not getting pizza?
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing?
Patrick	Hey, that's a great idea!
Patrick	And these are the Stairs Of Learning, right?
Patrick	Hey!  When did I start wearing a watch?
Patrick	Huh? Uh, sorry. Ohhhh!
Patrick	What does he teach us?
Patrick	I'm learning!
Patrick	Uh...uh...
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	Let me hear it.
Patrick	Psst! SpongeBob?
Patrick	Hi.
Patrick	I'll deal with you after class!
Patrick	SpongeBob and I were fighting.
Patrick	I'd hate you even if you were me. That's how much I hate you.
Patrick	I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs...
Patrick	Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm!
Patrick	Wow, a snail made out of bread.
Patrick	No!
Patrick	Yeah, thanks, I know. He's got nerves of steel. See you at the big race.
Patrick	My snail's really got Squidward scared, huh, SpongeBob?
Patrick	A burglar!
Patrick	Don't worry, Squidward, I know how much you wanted to win, so I had the trophy engraved to you.
Patrick	I'm already hearing voices!
Patrick	What shouldn't we do first? We're young,  we've got wheels,  the world is our oyster! SpongeBob, you got something on your shoulder.
Patrick	Let's see if he knows the secret cool-guy handshake.
Patrick	I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Debauchery!
Patrick	I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.
Patrick	Oh, yeah.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, your house is gone!
Patrick	Well, sure, its easy! I built my house all by myself!
Patrick	I wish I lived there.
Patrick	Well, you can't move back in with your parents! When my parents kicked me out of the house, I never went back. Wait! You and Gary can come stay with me!
Patrick	Spiders! Spiders!
Patrick	No, your other bottom!
Patrick	That was fun.
Patrick	Never ever?
Patrick	Thank you, Chip.  I guess I'll to have to find a new best friend. Hey, Squidward!
Patrick	I caught one!  Huh?
Patrick	Two ice creams!
Patrick	What do we do?
Patrick	Genius!
Patrick	Patrick to SpongeBob. I like going . Over.
Patrick	Bum! Bum! Bum!
Patrick	Yeah! And Fake Science Monthly!
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	Ever...
Patrick	Good thinking! All the experts say it's the only defense against a sea bear attack.
Patrick	The sound of a sea bear attack.
Patrick	As I do every morning.
Patrick	You lost your name tag?
Patrick	Hi.
Patrick	What's my motivation?
Patrick	That's it! Your name tag is in the apple on Mr. Krabs' desk!
Patrick	I wish I had a nose.
Patrick	I'm looking. I'm looking.
Patrick	Yes.
Patrick	I know where your name tag is.
Patrick	Uh... I forgot again.
Patrick	Don't mention it, buddy.
Patrick	You cut a hole in Farmer Jenkins' grain silo!
Patrick	Oh boy, a birthday party!
Patrick	Oh boy, Seanut Brittle--Gimmie!
Patrick	Hey, Seanut Brittle!  Oh, darn it, not again!
Patrick	But I can see it.
Patrick	OK, I'm ready.
Patrick	Yeah, but I said it was a good idea!
Patrick	Yeah.  I see what you mean.
Patrick	Hey SpongeBob, do you know what time it is?
Patrick	Me.
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	It says he isn't scared of ghosts.
Patrick	Uh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, we're visible again.
Patrick	Yeah?
Patrick	Jumping Jellyfish, Mermaid Man. He's destroying the shield!
Patrick	Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the flesh!
Patrick	Did you re-unite our heroes?
Patrick	Hehehehehe.
Patrick	All thanks to you. .
Patrick	10.
Patrick	And we got you a card.
Patrick	' Wow, he really does care.
Patrick	Why not?
Patrick	Wow.
Patrick	Squidward, what are you doing in there? You were suppose to keep watch.
Patrick	"I think I know why our code name is ""Worm-bait""."
Patrick	Gimme that cologne.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Oh, sure, but there was something I wanted to tell you...something important. Oh, I remember. Uh...  Who was I talking to?
Patrick	SpongeBob?
Patrick	What is it, buddy? You can tell me.
Patrick	Uh-huh.
Patrick	Yeah?
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	Can't hurt to look.
Patrick	It's the apocalypse! Office products falling from the sky!
Patrick	Pine cones, pine cones, pine cones.
Patrick	I want peanuts.
Patrick	Hey, watch where you're going.  Newspaper monster!
Patrick	Maybe.
Patrick	Okie dokie.
Patrick	Or maybe he's on a secret mission!
Patrick	Yeah, I guess we aren't good neighbors after all.
Patrick	That's not it, either.
Patrick	What'd you say?
Patrick	You can't? Oh, I know what to do!  That usually knocks him out.
Patrick	Let me take a look.  Hmmm, it's dark in here. I better light a match.
Patrick	Yeah, wanna see it?  It's fun to shake it up and watch it bounce around.
Patrick	Methinks it's mutton-tastic.
Patrick	Glad that's over.
Patrick	Oh no, I think I left the water running at home!
Patrick	I guess so. I'm gonna miss you, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Yeah, we need some gloves.
Patrick	No, uhh, I mean yes. Yes! That's what I said, heh. Yes.
Patrick	Yeah. Hey, can we eat those Krabby Patties now?
Patrick	It is?
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	Popcorn?
Patrick	Well, there's a city...
Patrick	The end.
Patrick	Hey...
Patrick	Oh, it's a camera.
Patrick	You're it.
Patrick	I find all this laughter to be highly illogical.
Patrick	Yes...  I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner.
Patrick	Indeed.
Patrick	I'd like a Krabby Patty, please.
Patrick	I didn't know there would be a test. I didn't study!
Patrick	This is a hotel?
Patrick	Wow.
Patrick	There's plenty more where that came from, my good friend  Squidward!
Patrick	Could you do one more thing for me?
Patrick	Well, because Mr. Krabs said you would! Well, be sure to make my back extra shiny clean.
Patrick	Wow, an indoor pool?! Well, this place  fancy!  Cannonball!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Wow.
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	Right.
Patrick	Ooh, ooh, this is a good one! It's a glass ball that lights up so you can see in the dark.
Patrick	Who?
Patrick	And I used to be dumb.
Patrick	I thought she ran away because she couldn't invent anything.
Patrick	Hey, you're the unpaid intern. You do the work.
Patrick	Okay.
Patrick	It works! It works!
Patrick	My turn.  Whoo-hoo!  All right!
Patrick	Ok, magical talking trashcan.  I wish SpongeBob were here to see this.
Patrick	Tag, you're it.
Patrick	Tag, you're it.
Patrick	Is that good?
Patrick	Party!
Patrick	Yeah, you should work out more.
Patrick	Ho, ho, ho!
Patrick	And you got your elbow in my ribs.
Patrick	Nice try, Squidward, but there's no Santa Claus here.
Patrick	Oh, SpongeBob, it's you.
Patrick	Sorry, officer.
Patrick	Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream!
Patrick	It's the maniac! Take him away! Take him away!
Patrick	SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer.
Patrick	Hurry SpongeBob, I think it's getting...  ...dark.
Patrick	Uhh, he's just standing there... menacingly!  Get out of there, SpongeBob!  That's his maniac shriek. He's going to attack!  He's acting all crazy! Run! Hide behind that building!  No, he's behind that building! Oh, quick, hide behind that street sign!  No wait! The maniac just went behind that sign! Quick! Get under the street light!  No wait, he's there, too! Run for your life!
Patrick	You mean your pet hasn't been vaccinated for mad snail disease?  Looks like the rash has already started.
Patrick	You need to get that snail of yours to a doctor before he bites someone important.  There's a mad snail on the loose!
Patrick	I don't believe that's the real SpongeBob. He looks pretty zombie-fied. Just look at how yellow he is.
Patrick	Yeah. What do you know about it?
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	Working at the Krusty Krab. Making krabby patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember.  Huh?
Patrick	I'll save you.
Patrick	Well, I thought it was a new type of cotton candy you wear on your head.
Patrick	SpongeBob.
Patrick	Whirlpool.
Patrick	Wow! I've never been in a submarine. Let's look inside.
Patrick	You're so tiny.  A giant SpongeBob!
Patrick	I don't know, but it's a real dump.
Patrick	No, give it back!
Patrick	We can filter the CO2 through our ballast tanks, refire the engines, and ride the shock wave out of here!
Patrick	Grow?
Patrick	I gotta get out of town!  Oh, thanks SpongeBob.
Patrick	It'll have to be one of your other chums 'cause my mind is set.
Patrick	And my pickles!
Patrick	Oh, no. I'm not Patrick Star?
Patrick	Goodbye sky.
Patrick	Oh, I'm not his girlfriend. I'm Pat...
Patrick	Do it again, do it again.
Patrick	Squidward, what's this about?
Patrick	Squidward?
Patrick	I dunno. Let's get a closer look.
Patrick	I don't think Gary likes Smelly.
Patrick	You're absolutely right.  It needs mustard.
Patrick	You're my hero.  SpongeBob! Help! Ah!
Patrick	I think we lost them.
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob, whatcha doing?
Patrick	Oh...soft serve.
Patrick	It's pistachio.
Patrick	Why's he saying the same thing Mister Magic's saying?
Patrick	Right here, buddy.  Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards.  Mmm.
Patrick	Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner.
Patrick	Who's a winner?!
Patrick	No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged.
Patrick	You're not the judge of me.
Patrick	Yeah, I thought you said it was hard.
Patrick	Ready.
Patrick	Yeah! All right!
Patrick	Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.
Patrick	I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?
Patrick	You will never guess what happen to me today.
Patrick	Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?
Patrick	The horn still works.  Hey, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Do you want me to give you lessons?
Patrick	What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test.
Patrick	Let's see what this baby can do.
Patrick	So?
Patrick	How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!
Patrick	I don't know! I don't have a license anymore.
Patrick	Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.
Patrick	Ready, buddy?
Patrick	SpongeBob, help! He's onto me! I don't have much time!
Patrick	Exactly!
Patrick	What's a king?
Patrick	I'll have ten Krabby Patties, a Krabby milkshake, large fries...
Patrick	Oh sorry, Mr Krabs, no can do. As king of Bikini Bottom, I am allowed to have anything I want. Isn't that right, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Tell him, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Life isn't fair, pal. Get used to it.
Patrick	I love being king.
Patrick	Back. Back. Okay. Yeah, that's good.  Perfect.
Patrick	[enraged] Get him! Attack! Attack!  SpongeBob, get him! So I decree. Attack!
Patrick	And what...
Patrick	Huh?  A knock knock joke!  Who's there?
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	Oh, I heard you. What I didn't hear was a hello.
Patrick	Hide me!
Patrick	No! No more running.
Patrick	Little baby doody-heads?
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	Ooh, I don't know. That one's pretty exclusive.
Patrick	Wow! I would kill for a net like that! You know, something small like a carrot. But not spiders, they're icky.
Patrick	SpongeBob, did you get your net back?
Patrick	Uhh, oh, not really. I just got lonely.
Patrick	A present? What is it?
Patrick	Well, it involves my best friend SpongeBob. I don't think he knows what happened, but it would really upset him if he found out.
Patrick	Uh, don't come in! I'm not decent! The house is a mess! There's a radiation leak!
Patrick	Nothing.
Patrick	I would kill for a net like that!
Patrick	Bye.
Patrick	You're acting weird.
Patrick	What street said that? Was it this one?  Mind your own business!
Patrick	This means more to me than money. It's my friend SpongeBob's.
Patrick	What?! I'm your best friend!
Patrick	It's my friend SpongeBob's gift.  I made you a new net.
Patrick	Barring the unforeseen hand of fate, I'm afraid it is.
Patrick	You want to go jellyfishing? I just got a new net.
Patrick	I broke my net!
Patrick	Yeah?
Patrick	Best Friends Day. Best Friends Day. Best Friends Day. Best Friends Day.
Patrick	Yum. Sweet, hot, and juicy. SpongeBob, this is a great gift.
Patrick	Thanks. Good-bye, Gummy. You be good to SpongeBob, you hear?  I love you, too, Gummy.  Well, he's all yours.
Patrick	Well, how do you explain this?
Patrick	Yeah, he does look rather dashing from this angle. Be that as it may, Gummy must be displayed properly and proudly. And I know just the place.  Isn't he breathtaking? All right, SpongeBob, we got to go. I'm gonna learn how to use a fork. Right, Robo?
Patrick	It's-it's...it's amazing. It's like a gummy wonderland. Whee! Wow, I wish I were having this much fun. I knew you'd love it.
Patrick	Squidward? Sandy? Gee, everyone is having fun with my Gummy but me. I-I-I mean, your Gummy.
Patrick	Oh, that's easy.  I told you it was easy.  Wow! This is the best Best Friends Day ever!
Patrick	Oh! I had to move my rock out of the dark and into the light.
Patrick	No, Squidward! Don't go out in the dark!  Oh, why won't he listen?
Patrick	More lights, SpongeBob! More lights!
Patrick	Too much light! Too much light!
Patrick	Oh, you know, usual.
Patrick	No. Uhh, SpongeBob, is Sandy's rocket alien proof?
Patrick	Come on!
Patrick	Look, I'm winning!
Patrick	I like rockets.
Patrick	We've started the rocket!
Patrick	Hey, who turned the heavy back on?
Patrick	So you mean to say they've taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we've been thinking our thoughts we think we thought? I think...
Patrick	Wait, what's that?  I think I'm gonna be sick.
Patrick	It's awake!
Patrick	Or should I say Ms. Alien Pants.
Patrick	I'm waiting.
Patrick	There's the mailman!
Patrick	What's wrong SpongeBob?
Patrick	You missed your surprise birthday party, so I just wanted to bring you a present and some cake because you missed it.
Patrick	Oh, yeah.  The fork!
Patrick	Could you come back later? He's having a moment.
Patrick	SpongeBob?
Patrick	For a sec, I...
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob! Eww!!!
Patrick	Scratch it like there's no tomorrow!
Patrick	This.
Patrick	Really? How about if I squeeze it like this?  Or this?  Or this?
Patrick	Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, I can see you through this straw.
Patrick	That's going to leave a mark.
Patrick	What's he doing now?
Patrick	Self destruct!!  There's a call coming through on my Pants-A-Phone.
Patrick	This looks like a job for Patrick Star Laser Pants!
Patrick	My laser pants aren't working right.
Patrick	Abandon ship!
Patrick	I really am Patrick.
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	You ready to ride the Fist O' Pain?
Patrick	Really, really scary. I mean fun-ifying. I mean horror-tastic. I mean fun-ible! Fun, really, really fun.
Patrick	Yeah, bad luck. I mean good luck, very good luck.
Patrick	Yeah, only a real baby would be afraid of a roll... Whoa!
Patrick	That ride's for babies.
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	I'm hungry, too.
Patrick	It's just a ride. What are you so scared about? You can do it.
Patrick	Big deal, I did half that stuff this morning.
Patrick	After you.
Patrick	Me too.
Patrick	Good-bye, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Uh-huh. I came prepared too.  Alright, lets do it.
Patrick	Wait, you wanted to see out the window? Weird.
Patrick	Could you pass the chips, SpongeBob?
Patrick	I've never picnicked on a catapult before. Have you, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Uh, new glasses?
Patrick	Oh. SpongeBob?
Patrick	Thanks, SpongeBob. Party at my house!
Patrick	Yeah, what's the big idea?  I don't need this aggravation!  are you still standing here?!
Patrick	Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Want to give me a ruling, SpongeBob?
Patrick	SpongeBob?
Patrick	Ok, here I go. Watch me now.  Cramp!
Patrick	No, no!  Yay!
Patrick	Sponge--
Patrick	I never thought about anything!
Patrick	It's a sign! A sign that fell from the back of your pants. I've learned to trust signs like that.
Patrick	SpongeBob! THIS PENCIL IS BROKEN! Why won't it make words?
Patrick	Don't hit me with a dodgeball!
Patrick	I'm worried my poem's not gonna be any good and you're going to hit me with dodgeballs.
Patrick	I'm making art!
Patrick	Um, I don't know. You're not gonna throw dodgeballs at me?
Patrick	You need it louder? Okay!
Patrick	Then let's go right now, come on!
Patrick	What record?
Patrick	Good idea.
Patrick	Oh, you mean the angry mob with the pitchforks and torches?
Patrick	Oh, yeah. My song.  Oh, Twinkle, Twinkle, Patrick Star--
Patrick	Two whole days?!
Patrick	Is Sandy the one I call Mom?
Patrick	Ow! Ah, Ooh, ow, ooh, ah, yah, aah.  Connect the dots.  I drawed a horsey.  Ouch! Why does this flea keep biting me?
Patrick	Eee!
Patrick	Yeah, good to see ya.
Patrick	Oh, I've got half a mind, buddy.
Patrick	Whooooo! Chamomile, chamomile, chamomile! Oh, she really knows how to pound 'em down, huh, SpongeBob?  SpongeBob... SpongeBob? Sponge-  That's a good lookin' donut... Wow...  ...This donut's connected to SpongeBob! Oh...  It worked!  A beautiful specimen of donut-hood. A donut this nice deserves to be served on fine china!  The good plate.  Don't worry, donut. No longer will you suffer the indignity of sub-par dining wear! I don't think I've ever seen a donut this nice before...  Except maybe that donut SpongeBob showed me last night...
Patrick	And now...  SpongeBob's donut, I ate it!  I've gotta sneak this back into SpongeBob's house before he-  Hello...?
Patrick	Ow, hot, hot, hot, ow!
Patrick	I don't have anything behind my back! So don't look there!
Patrick	...When?
Patrick	Are are are are you sure you want to give me this mayonnaise?
Patrick	Patrick sad!
Patrick	No! SpongeBob!
Patrick	Ok! So this is the way it's gonna be. I hope you're happy.
Patrick	More like the scrap-heap.  They never come out right! Oh well, let's try again.
Patrick	It's not?
Patrick	...All day.  Um, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Whoa, what is it? It looks really old.
Patrick	What's it doing?
Patrick	Where'd SpongeBob go?
Patrick	Oh golly! Oh, I don't know how much longer I can hold this!
Patrick	I thought I heard a popping sound?
Patrick	But Atlantis had the oldest bubble which I cruelly destroyed!
Patrick	Hey, buddy.
Patrick	Ah. I have solved my hunger problem.
Patrick	SpongeBob, get out of my taco!  What's the matter, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Oh, yeah, I can pay for it.
Patrick	Oh, I'm payin' for it all right.
Patrick	I accidentally tried the hand soap.  It doesn't taste as good as it smells.
Patrick	Almost done, Mr. Krabs.
Patrick	I have to get rid of this trash, but it won't go down.
Patrick	Can I eat now?
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	Then what happened?
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!  You forgot to tell me you're leaving!
Patrick	Summer camp? But I'm not even ready yet!
Patrick	Actually, I am a little hungry.
Patrick	Not bad! Except for this aftertaste.
Patrick	If only we could think of some sort group activity that we can all do together, then we would all be having the same amount of fun as each other.  Good night!
Patrick	Can we come?!
Patrick	And a nice fire to keep us warm.
Patrick	Um...maybe,...uh...
Patrick	Do you wanna go play hide and go-seek?
Patrick	I don't know about you, but I've got all the comforts of home right here.
Patrick	...cake. I was just going to share my golden sponge cake with him. It has delicious cream filling too!
Patrick	Well not if I eat you first!
Patrick	I was not! It was supposed to be stew!  Whew! I'm getting tired.
Patrick	No, got you!
Patrick	Me too.
Patrick	No. I was only pretending to be my famous, Great-Great-Great Uncle, Patrick Revere! He rode through the streets warning Bikini Bottom of the coming hordes of ravenous, man-eating mollusks!
Patrick	Oh, well then it's lucky you have me as a famous friend. Or your life would be a hollow shell.
Patrick	SpongeBob doesn't like me anymore!
Patrick	Oh! Let me try! Let me try!
Patrick	Nope.
Patrick	OK.  I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
Patrick	...Go!
Patrick	Hello?
Patrick	Oops.
Patrick	I think I landed on a rock. [Patrick shows a big rock on the back of his head]
Patrick	We?
Patrick	Now hold it, SpongeBob. You better let me drive.
Patrick	"You said ""Bye, Squidward"" twice."
Patrick	"No, but I see a sign. It says. ""Warning: Ab...eyes?"""
Patrick	[the submarine loses its bolts and breaks in the water] And now a deafening warning siren!
Patrick	[a close up to SpongeBob & Patrick] Neither do I!
Patrick	And paper.
Patrick	You...found a new best friend?
Patrick	Yeah, look at this guy.
Patrick	And that's how we won our right to wash as we please.
Patrick	Oh, wait. You've got something on your tongue.
Patrick	"Ugh, do I have to spell it out for you?  U...R... huh... How do you spell ""not my friend""?"
Patrick	Dirty!
Patrick	Yeah, well  I got your eyeballs!
Patrick	I'll fix it.
Patrick	No! Not a pedicure!!  No, not that, anything but tha-- Nail Polish?!  You sick little monster, face my morning breath!!!
Patrick	No, not...not deodorant
Patrick	Ha! I got you now!
Patrick	That's right, your precious patties on my stinky feet!
Patrick	No, not soap! You wouldn't dare!
Patrick	Man! To get my filth back, I'll have to wallow in mud forever!
Patrick	And since I'm clean, I can get even filthier! Thanks, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Well, it was great until you showed up.
Patrick	What am I gonna do without my best friend? I should never have been mean to you!
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	Oh, wait a minute! SpongeBob, you already do work in a fast food restaurant!
Patrick	Hey guys!
Patrick	Thank you, come again!  Can I help whoever's next, please?  What's the password, please?
Patrick	Looking for your calling, huh?  Hmmm... So, what are you good at?
Patrick	Come with me. First, sit down on this chair. Clear your mind. Empty it off all thoughts... until you're doing... absolutely... nothing.
Patrick	Who's Nick? Sorry Squidward. I couldn't wait any longer, I've gotta use your toilet. No questions! Thanks.  Phew! I wouldn't go in there for a couple days. Or weeks.
Patrick	Me too! Me too!
Patrick	All right! I play a mean belly.
Patrick	Perhaps you didn't notice My new hairdo.
Patrick	Hey, check this one out.
Patrick	I once searched for my innermost secrets. All I found was this.
Patrick	Ohh. Nice kitty.  Here, kitty. Want a sausage? A nice, delicious, tasty...... sausage.  Spawn of a gefilte fish!
Patrick	Yeah, thanks buddy! You really saved my behind! No joke!
Patrick	I think, I broke my bottom.
Patrick	Exactly.
Patrick	What happened to you?
Patrick	Hey, listen...when you decide to do something fun you know where to find me.
Patrick	It won't be easy but I'll do it.
Patrick	SpongeBob, the weird therapy is working. Your craters are coming back. We just have to keep pushing the boundaries. We've gotta get stranger.  Talk backwards.
Patrick	No!!
Patrick	SpongeBob, you're back to your square shape.
Patrick	Yeah?
Patrick	You called the right person, Mr. SpongeBob.  Now, let's see where the problem's at.  Hmmm... interesting.
Patrick	Oh, but I'm sure you can figure it out with your 12 years of med school.
Patrick	Okay. But we play by  rules, SquareBob.  Well, here's your problem. Don't you worry, buddy.  We're gonna make it go away.
Patrick	Probably not.
Patrick	How do we do that?
Patrick	SpongeBob, these are the best years of our lives, and you want to waste them blowing bubbles? We should be living in the moment! We should be living like Lar...  This is it SpongeBob! This is where we redeem are miserable lives! It's time to start...  ...  Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob?
Patrick	You must defeat your reason, before you can start...  ...living like Larry!  Wo-hoo! SpongeBob, this is it!
Patrick	Here's to living like Larry!
Patrick	I feel sorry for you.
Patrick	Are you sure about this SpongeBob?
Patrick	No, I just didn't want to get it all wrinkled up. Last one in is a rotten egg!
Patrick	We've gotta look our best.
Patrick	Got 'ya, 15 seconds, it'll take a few minutes.
Patrick	Afraid so. Bye girls.
Patrick	Ew, what are you gonna do?
Patrick	One caramel sundae please.
Patrick	What?
Patrick	They're pretty.
Patrick	Boy I do! Thanks Squidward. Want some SpongeBob? Last one to the cone is a rotten clam!
Patrick	Do you want your grow juice back?
Patrick	Yeah, I'll go first.
Patrick	Get ready.
Patrick	No, the other one.
Patrick	Try it again.
Patrick	I know! I know! Um, made you a monster!
Patrick	Yeah! Squidward, tell them about all those times that you didn't punch me in the face.
Patrick	You do?
Patrick	I guess I'll always be a noseless freak.
Patrick	Sorry doc, but I don't really think it's me.
Patrick	I will! Now, how do I use this thing?  What is that smell?  Pastries? I never knew they smelled so good!
Patrick	There's another one! No! I can't take it!
Patrick	You are sick, Squidward!  There's that smell again!
Patrick	Well you can't go to work smelling like that. You should be thanking me, SpongeBob.  Smell's like, something greasy!  Nobody move! I am ridding this place of it's disgusting stench, with these scented candles!
Patrick	Say no more, you can thank me later. Right now, I've got plenty more stink holes to swab clean.
Patrick	I heard that!
Patrick	Here you go, buddy.
Patrick	Good one!
Patrick	You know what to do.
Patrick	Hey guys. Could you fix me and the wife up a couple of Krabby Patties?
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, what are you doing?
Patrick	You don't understand, SpongeBob! You'll never understand what it's like to be alone behind the red rope!
Patrick	Uh, I can't quite see it from here. I'll just have to climb on board.
Patrick	What'd she say?
Patrick	Wow.
Patrick	Plus, we wanna talk to you.
Patrick	Not since I saw my first triple-layer cheese cake.
Patrick	Hey, that's what they used to call me!
Patrick	Hey, I was gonna eat that!
Patrick	I love this song!
Patrick	Well, the last time I remember coughing like that, I was sitting at home eating a box of Kelp Jerky.
Patrick	No! You always give a choking victim the Slimelich Maneuver, first! And if that doesnt work, you walk away and pretend like you never saw them before.  Like this! Ready, clam?
Patrick	Thats not a baby, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Thats my specialty.
Patrick	Having good ideas?
Patrick	Huh? Oh, I dont know. I am getting kinda hungry, though. Ill catch up with you later, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Well, my dad always told me: when you have money, you need to do more than just spend it. You need to have a plan.
Patrick	You can say that again!
Patrick	A lifetime supply of strawberry gum!
Patrick	Well, I dont think so. Normally, I
Patrick	SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
Patrick	SpongeBob, if you keep throwing your money away like that, you wont have any left to
Patrick	Oh, hey SpongeBob.
Patrick	There is no right or wrong when it comes to that stuff, SpongeBob. There just either is or there isnt.
Patrick	Inside the Bikini Bottom Diamond Mine!
Patrick	Is it time to look yet?
Patrick	Can we wear costumes?
Patrick	Whoo!
Patrick	Whoo!
Patrick	Oh, right, it's just those guys we're gonna wrestle.  Hello, fellow competitors.
Patrick	Oh, hey, SpongeBob.
Patrick	With pleasure.
Patrick	Huh? Oh, I'm fine. I just like to suck on my hand.
Patrick	1 and 2 and squeeze.
Patrick	One, two, three, four...
Patrick	Ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred! Oh! I hate counting! Just give me what he's having! Oh, boy! Let's see which card I got! Is this a good card, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Yes, sir.
Patrick	What?
Patrick	Sheesh. Don't get your pants up in a square knot, SpongeBob. I don't even believe in pockets. I keep everything I need right here. In the folds of my back fat.  You seem to be pretty fond of this little thing. Why don't you just keep it?
Patrick	Do you mind if I hold on to it? Just for today?
Patrick	Ugh!  Man, this card is fantastic!  Breaking and entering sure makes a fella hungry. Hey, why don't we eat some dinner? And then I'll give you your card.  Ew! This barbecue's really filthy. Oh, but this'll take care of it.
Patrick	Dinner is served.
Patrick	Aw... sure you will.
Patrick	They're all yours, buddy. See ya tomorrow.
Patrick	What do you mean?
Patrick	That's the one! Why don't you take a bathroom break tomorrow, sneak out the window, get your book signed, and sneak back into class! It wouldn't take long at all!
Patrick	Yeah?
Patrick	SpongeBob, look!  Let's go catch it!
Patrick	I didn't do it. They did.  They're friendly.
Patrick	Oh, don't be such a sourpuss.  Here, I'll buy you a cone.
Patrick	Nah. I found the institution had nothing of to offer me. I was stagnating.
Patrick	Well, at least you still have the hat.
Patrick	Was it my fault?
Patrick	Ever!
Patrick	Secret!
Patrick	Initiation.
Patrick	Yeah. Those Feather Buddies better hope they don't run into us in a dark alley.
Patrick	That's what I'm talkin' about!
Patrick	It works!
Patrick	Borrow something, and he'll have to come over to get it back.  Uhh!  Well... hey, thanks for lettin' me play puzzle with you. See ya later!
Patrick	Hey, hey. You want to hear how long I can do this for?
Patrick	Do I know you?
Patrick	Oh, right. You're that round pants fellow.
Patrick	Wow!  can you beat me up next?
Patrick	Really?
Patrick	Heroes! Heroes! Hero...  ...oes.
Patrick	Well duh!
Patrick	Out of the way gramps! That's my trophy old lady!  It's going to be and action packed thrill ride of geriatric proportions! And the best part is, there is no way we can lose with these costumes on!
Patrick	For Neptune's sake SpongeBob, if we're not going to go around town pretending to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, then who is?!
Patrick	Too harsh?  Explain.
Patrick	You handle Man Ray, I'll take care of his lackey.
Patrick	And then some.
Patrick	It was. I traded with SpongeBob.
Patrick	Actually, that time, it really was me.
Patrick	Well, actually, there  a railroad convention in town last week, and I bought myself this nifty conductor's cap.
Patrick	I see that now. There's never been any choice for me.
Patrick	Tartar sauce!
Patrick	Go!
Patrick	Don't worry. I know how to do this.
Patrick	You know, you worry too much.  The Patrick is here and SpongeBob I know a lot about head injuries, believe...  ...me. Hey, what's that on your shoe?
Patrick	It's working, it's working...
Patrick	Don't, don't hurt us!
Patrick	One watermelon fresh from the manure field, your spookiness.
Patrick	I found it.
Patrick	Yes.
Patrick	Oh look, you missed some.
Patrick	You're right. He really needs to get up to the great beyond.
Patrick	No, what you said before when you..
Patrick	How high's he going to go?
Patrick	Okay SpongeBob! It's your turn! I'm ready!
Patrick	Ball! Let me see it!  What a weird ball.
Patrick	That sounds delightful!
Patrick	SpongeBob, something tells me that Mr. Wormsley is actually a  Wormsley.
Patrick	Maybe you could take care of them.
Patrick	Then why aren't you saying the words?
Patrick	Yes, tonight! Well, when else am I gonna celebrate it? At least I had the courtesy to start the party after my best friend got off of work. See ya tonight, buddy
Patrick	Hello!?! My birthday cake!
Patrick	I'm so excited, I've been waiting for a whole year!
Patrick	SpongeBob, why are your clothes invisible?
Patrick	Hold on, where're you going?
Patrick	I'm waiting for you, so we can play the day away.  Oh, barnacles! You're wearing that dumb hat, again! Every time you wear that stupid thing, you're, you're gone for the whole day!
Patrick	Oh no! He's got the hat, too!
Patrick	Oh boy, gimme my hat!
Patrick	Any thing for my new hat.
Patrick	Yeah! Wheeee!
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	I like pie.
Patrick	What's that, pal?
Patrick	Hey, good idea. Hey, Squidward, could you hold me hat so it won't get hurt?  Thanks buddy.
Patrick	Argh, I think I'm stuck!
Patrick	Hey, Squidward, d'you think you could, uh, you know
Patrick	I figured it out; it's the hat that makes me fall, it makes me top heavy!
Patrick	Really?
Patrick	I don't know.
Patrick	Hm.....nope. No. Nope. Nope. Uh-uh. No. Nah.
Patrick	There's gotta be something we can do.
Patrick	Almost there!
Patrick	But where's the toy store?
Patrick	Mm-hm.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob. whats with the tutu?
Patrick	"What part of ""never"" don't you understand?"
Patrick	Oh, it's sneaky alright. Really sneaky. C'mon, haven't you always wanted to have a toy store all to yourself?
Patrick	Push, SpongeBob! Push! Push, man, push!  Okay, SpongeBob gimmie your hand. That's my boy. Brace yourself.
Patrick	I can't hear you! It's too dark in here! Don't worry. I'll just use my Night Vision.
Patrick	Well, I guess it worked its way into my brain. Shoot! The batteries are dead! It's dark... and scary!
Patrick	That...want...to...get us.
Patrick	That was fun! Now let's dress up like fairy princesses! .
Patrick	What?
Patrick	No, besides, I don't really think my shins should be involved. They're a bit flabby today.
Patrick	Small plastic disc that you throw!!!  I love to play... small plastic disc that you throw!
Patrick	I caught it!  Wasn't that cool, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Boring, SpongeBob, boring!
Patrick	Whoa! What are you doing!? You destroyed my castle!
Patrick	Now, we're even!
Patrick	You tyrant! You've done it again! I'll show you what for!
Patrick	No way! You started it.
Patrick	I like you this much!  Feel me!
Patrick	I wasn't going to do this, but you've left me no choice.
Patrick	I bet I can clean up faster than you!
Patrick	Hey, look at this!
Patrick	...METAB...BO...
Patrick	Okay, I forgive you. And... I'm sorry for yelling. Okay, so can I tell you something honestly?
Patrick	Uhh, what's that number before one?
Patrick	They seem to think it's interesting.
Patrick	OOH I like that one!
Patrick	Hmmmm, Mhmmmm, Uh huuuh. I think I see the problem. Your potty has a shocky thing in it.
Patrick	Excuse me sir.  My resignation.
Patrick	Yes, sir.  Who are you? And Who are you working for?!
Patrick	Hey, there's my house.
Patrick	Nice.
Patrick	Sandy's trapped in that box!  Sandy?
Patrick	Hmm. You guys ready to give up?
Patrick	I didn't get to sleep in  this morning.
Patrick	Owie!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob.
Patrick	What is?
Patrick	Hmm.
Patrick	Violin.
Patrick	I thought it was cocoa!
Patrick	I never realized how delicious your hot cocoa is.
Patrick	Darn it!
Patrick	Darn it!
Patrick	Well played.
Patrick	Who's the green guy?
Patrick	Will there be any spelling in this game?
Patrick	Hey, I want some too.
Patrick	Hey, you'll never guess what I found on the street  yeah, I'll hurry
Patrick	I just peel the stickers of the squares and put them back on in the right spaces
Patrick	Do you think Triton was in that cage for a reason.
Patrick	Gotcha pall  What?
Patrick	You thinking what I'm thinking?
Patrick	Don't rush me! Okay got it!
Patrick	Do you think now's a good time to get those Triple Gooberry Sundays you where talking about?
Patrick	I'm not on TV!  SpongeBob! I went home and turned on my TV, but... I wasn't on the TV. Why did you lie to me, SpongeBob? Why?
Patrick	SpongeBob! You gotta try this!
Patrick	All right!
Patrick	My shorts are wet!
Patrick	Huh...
Patrick	There, is that better?
Patrick	That's the spirit!
Patrick	Dig in!
Patrick	We wanna play!
Patrick	Oh, come on! How many times does the carnival come to town?!  Ready?
Patrick	Well, have some. It'll make you feel better.
Patrick	I was only trying to help.
Patrick	Who asked you?!  Forget it. I'll just play...uh... fetch!  Where is it? Where is it? Gotcha!  Is SpongeBob okay? Oh, what do I care? I'm no longer supposed to help.  Buddy!  Uhh! SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Hey, whatcha watchin'?
Patrick	This is all my fault! Me and my dumb ideas!  I'm so sorry!
Patrick	Oh, well. Never mind.
Patrick	Oh, sorry to interrupt your fit of self-loathing, SpongeBob.  I'm just borrowing your refrigerator again.
Patrick	Oh, no! What are you gonna do?!
Patrick	Ohhh. Mayhaps you should talk to the sponge behind you. He looks happy.
Patrick	Oh, you have the talent. But do you have the natural ability?
Patrick	SpongeBob. Hey, SpongeBob. Did you say something?
Patrick	Yeah.  Let's see here. I have a question about the Krabby Kiddy meal. Is it really, really, really cute?
Patrick	Is this enough?
Patrick	Yeah yeah yeah.
Patrick	What?
Patrick	My Kiddy meal didn't come with a toy!
Patrick	"It came from the meal that we're ""sharing."""
Patrick	Aren't you supposed to be working?
Patrick	NO TOUCHING!!! See you tomorrow  Say goodnight Patty Pal  Goodnight SpongeBob
Patrick	Got any ID?
Patrick	Deceiver! You didn't leave at all!
Patrick	I can't! Patty Pal and me have really bonded!
Patrick	Mm-mm!
Patrick	Mm-mm!
Patrick	One.
Patrick	Oh boy.
Patrick	No, it's mine!
Patrick	I did not!
Patrick	This time it's on me.
Patrick	Yyyeeeeeep!
Patrick	SpongeBob?
Patrick	Yeah, The Flying Dutchman has a beard!
Patrick	We're mermaids!
Patrick	I didn't sleep at all. I can see through my eyelids.  My eyelids!
Patrick	Maybe the weird hairless man will change us back?
Patrick	And you can't go on your date because you're ugly?
Patrick	Hey.. What are you doing here?
Patrick	I gotta get outta here!
Patrick	Yeah, thanks.
Patrick	You like it here so much, you feel yourself being moved to a song?
Patrick	I jellyfish all da' night!
Patrick	Well, its sorta like other roads, except there's no sto-
Patrick	SpongeBob, I'll never forget what my great-Uncle Cletus said right before he was arrested during a freedom march.
Patrick	I don't know, because no one one ever heard from him again.
Patrick	I am!
Patrick	Look!
Patrick	Did you say something?
Patrick	Well I lost a quarter.
Patrick	Well, if you want to be scary, you got to need a good costume.
Patrick	Come on, SpongeBob. It's little kids! Little kids are easy to scare!
Patrick	No, no, no wait. Don't tell me.  D-don't tell me. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! I can do this. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Okay, tell me.
Patrick	All right, let's get to it.
Patrick	Oooh, I'm the Flying Dutchman's best friend!
Patrick	There's a whole party just full of people at the Krusty Krab and the Flying Dutchman is going to be show up uninvited!  Here comes someone now!
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	Hey!
Patrick	End credits? But I don't want it to end!
Patrick	Hey, buddy! Is it 7:30 already?
Patrick	Umm... sure. And did you remember to put that package outside where I told you?
Patrick	Hey, thanks for the TV, SpongeBob.  I'm gonna watch it all night!
Patrick	What?
Patrick	Uh, ok.  Garbage cans. No. Jar. No. Box. No. Sandys door! Twist to the left.
Patrick	Hmm, no. Its not cotton. Its actually an old moldy piece of Krabby Patty.  Mmm.
Patrick	No more tight jeans!
Patrick	Look, another rubber stopper for my rubber stopper collection.  It's a little land that's all mine.  Now it's snowing in my little land.  It's snowing again.  Hey, my little land must be having an earthquake.  Must have been an aftershock.  Uh, hey, no wonder you're angry. You just gotta turn it upside down. See?
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob! Hey, up here! Look, no hands!
Patrick	Well, in that case, SpongeBob, I would like to introduce you to... I would like to introduce you to... I forgot his name. What do I do? What do I do?
Patrick	Doesn't have a home?  Hey, wait a minute, you can live under my rock if you want, Rarrg.
Patrick	Encore!  Wow, the police have arrived.
Patrick	Of course. He's a giant freak of nature, not a freak of nature that can't speak.  And so as the lowly snail sheddeth his shell, and the lofty gull moldeth his feathers, the brightest of friendships must dimmeth as the setting sun.
Patrick	SpongeBob! Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?
Patrick	The bus is here! The bus is here!  C'mon, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Has anyone seen my cuff links?!
Patrick	Ah, riding by piggy-back is exhausting.
Patrick	Yeah...
Patrick	Home, Reginald.
Patrick	Sorry.
Patrick	We should go find it! To protect it from people like us.
Patrick	Let's ask Plankton. He's a geezer.
Patrick	Oh man, I hope this question;s not for me. I hate questions.
Patrick	Oh, no thanks. I'm not into the whole walking thing.
Patrick	Oh! Oh! I know exactly what to do!  NEEIIGGHH
Patrick	Well, that was the whole point of coming here right?
Patrick	And if we don't, we'll never know...
Patrick	Peek-a-boo!
Patrick	What is that?
Patrick	Cops, I need you!
Patrick	Don't worry, buddy. I'm sure it'll turn up.
Patrick	Say, would you mind scooching over? I can't even move my eyebrows.
Patrick	Gotcha, pal. Oh, wait, I can't count that high. Can we just jump on the count of one?
Patrick	Okay. But I don't see how this is gonna get us any closer to the tr--  Are you crazy?! Please! I'm sorry for any grief I've caused you! Don't do it, please!  Hey, we're flying!
Patrick	Hey, where'd all thosethose shiny tubes?
Patrick	It told me to.
Patrick	Now, where were we? Oh, yeah. I'll save us!  Ice-cold lemonade! Get your ice-cold, tasty, refreshing, and also ice-cold lemon...  Hey! Everyone stops for free lemonade!
Patrick	Hmm.  T-H-R-O-T-T-L-E. Brake! I can do that.  You didn't need this, did you?
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	I'll mail myself to your house!
Patrick	What are we gonna do?!
Patrick	Tag!
Patrick	I don't know!
Patrick	Must've been something it ate.
Patrick	No need to thank us.
Patrick	Tag! You're it!
Patrick	He's already at Number Two! Who knows how many numbers we have until he reaches three?
Patrick	Hey! I want to learn how to do that.
Patrick	"I also remember you saying, ""If there's anything you can do to return the favor, anything at all... to let you know."
Patrick	Inverty whirpey... Got it!
Patrick	Definitely!
Patrick	Clamo!
Patrick	I'm a genius?
Patrick	Karate power!
Patrick	I said one Krusty Combo. Don't you speak karate?
Patrick	No buts! just hands.
Patrick	What is that wonderful stench?  Whatcha got there?
Patrick	HIYAA HIYAA-
Patrick	Wooooooooooo.
Patrick	Oh. Okay. I know, I'll stop a chop, with a chop!
Patrick	Noooo! Gianter TVs! HIYAAA!
Patrick	So I haven't crushed the life of my best friend in the world?
Patrick	Ha! Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm a sea star. My limbs grow back. See?
Patrick	SpongeBob! SpongeBob, did I make it? I brought my favorite rock to donate to the time thinger.
Patrick	Okay, Rocky, you're going bye-bye now.
Patrick	I'm just gonna hang here for a while, maybe get a kelp soda later.
Patrick	I believe my left hand was on red.
Patrick	Not bad, SpongeBob. Not bad. I dream of a town with a perfect blend of commerce and irrigation.  Not to mention the breathtaking views.
Patrick	Ow!
Patrick	Tag.
Patrick	Yeah, let's go poke someone else.
Patrick	Well, how about instead of vowing, we just do it?
Patrick	Yeah, we really tried to make it last
Patrick	Hey SpongeBob! Are you ready to...  SpongeBob, you promised firsties!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob! You're right on time for our play date
Patrick	I don't know, are we buddies?
Patrick	Hey, buddy!
Patrick	Hold still, buddy!
Patrick	Yeah?
Patrick	Do I have to know what hide-and-seek is in order to play it?
Patrick	Gosh!
Patrick	Play what?
Patrick	What's hide 'n seek?
Patrick	Oh no! I can't!
Patrick	One, two, three...
Patrick	OF COURSE! I'm the best hide and seek player ever aren't I?
Patrick	"""Dear Patrick: I couldn't find you so you win. But that's OK because I still had fun playing. You are truly the greatest hide and seek player in the whole world. Love SpongeBob. Thanks SpongeBob. That really means a lot."""
Patrick	Maybe. Or maybe it's those guys.
Patrick	Say no more.
Patrick	Wait, hold on a second.
Patrick	SpongeBob, what are we going to do?
Patrick	Okay, you go!
Patrick	Yeah. And it made me look more smart-like.  What does the magazine say we should do next?
Patrick	I hate to burst your bubble, but my favorite color is........ it is aquamarine. Sorry I doubted you.
Patrick	No peeking!
Patrick	My turn! But, give me some hard questions. Not like those softballs you answered.
Patrick	Oh, barnacles! Oh, I was so close.
Patrick	Belly button, huh? Hmm. An innie!
Patrick	Oh! Oh! I remember! Your favorite food is a chum burger!
Patrick	Ooh! This is for the win!
Patrick	Ooh! It's right on the tip of my tongue!
Patrick	I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Patrick	Oh No!! I'm out of coral on a stick!  Time to chomp through the fried barnacles!
Patrick	You mean SpongeBob!
Patrick	Fine!  Well mister police guy won't let me in the front huh! Well, I'll just find my own way in!
Patrick	I unfortunately don't know who that dullard is, but I know you kidnapped SpongeBob.
Patrick	Oops.
Patrick	Nice facilities. Great water pressure.
Patrick	Hey, try to catch me, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Oh, I like not knowing! Let's play!
Patrick	Okay.
Patrick	You got it, Mr. Krabs!
Patrick	Oh, jeez, SpongeBob, who cares if everyone knows about our secret hideout?
Patrick	No wonder we were so amused!
Patrick	Yeah! Totally realistic!
Patrick	Nope!
Patrick	How, how about taste? Can you taste yourself think?
Patrick	Yeah, thanks.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob? Did you see the way those curtains jerked shut?
Patrick	Go on. Pop it!
Patrick	Hey, Squidward, who's the lovely lady? I think she's giving me the cutesy eye!
Patrick	Makin' it clean, and livin' a dream. Makin' a scene, I'm makin' it clean, I'm makin' it clean. I'm makin' it clean!
Patrick	Nobody does. I lost her in the surf when we were kids.
Patrick	Sorry, I was getting my place ready for my sister.
Patrick	It's so good to see you.
Patrick	Lets go inside and play.
Patrick	Thanks sis!
Patrick	You can call it whatever you like sis as long as we make it spiffy!
Patrick	How dare you call my sister a thief, just because she took some of your things...
Patrick	Your still my rock big sis.
Patrick	Well uh...well...well it's about your temper Sam.
Patrick	Sis, wait! Hold on! Aw, don't feel sad. You don't have go!
Patrick	Uhh, do what again? Ow!
Patrick	Ready to lose? Weather permitting, of course.
Patrick	But we sculpted your likeness out of butter on hole five.
Patrick	Nice shot.
Patrick	Ha! Let's see how you do against the windmill. You haven't got a chance.
Patrick	SpongeBob readies the approach shot. He's gotta be very careful he doesn't hook the shot here, because this would certainly be an inopportune time for a bogey. A pressure-packed shot to be sure.
Patrick	Watch out for the water hazard.
Patrick	Well, how do I know? I was just copying you.
Patrick	Okay, okay!
Patrick	It might have been in the kelp salad.
Patrick	I don't know. Gotta be around here somewhere.
Patrick	Wait up! Warmer. Warmer. Red hot!
Patrick	AAAAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!
Patrick	Uhh, look a little closer, buddy.
Patrick	Fore!  It's all yours.
Patrick	Good game, pal.
Patrick	It's Spring Cleaning Day?! Why didn't anyone tell me?!
Patrick	Nice dress.
Patrick	Thats just fancy talk. If you want to be fancy, hold your pinky up like this! The higher you hold it, the fancier you are!
Patrick	Pinky! Pinky!
Patrick	You can't leave now! You'll blow it!
Patrick	We know, We've got... to get... out.
Patrick	Yup.
Patrick	Does anyone have a quarter?
Patrick	Come on, wormies! Giddy up! Hmmmm...
Patrick	Whoa! Look at that!
Patrick	Oh, be careful, this is my last one!
Patrick	I saw something shiny.
Patrick	I wish I did. I lost my last one to the monster and now I'm so hungry! At least,  I still have this bag of Jelly Beans to hold me over.  Hey! Is this taxi even moving?!  Come on, Gary!
Patrick	Oh geez... why do I have to do everything?
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Yeah! I love boat screaming! Oh! Oh! Hey! Hey! Here comes another one!
Patrick	Ow!  What's the big idea!?
Patrick	I am curious to know what mature people, like Squidward, do. Won't you show me?
Patrick	Sounds good to me!
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	For a baby!
Patrick	Duh, yeah Squidward. I'm frankly shocked they serve such elementary fare here.
Patrick	Security!
Patrick	It feels like four.
Patrick	A most exemplary performance!
Patrick	How do you know my name!?
Patrick	Oh, sorry, wrong rock.
Patrick	H-Hold on, I'd like to sit in the back of the class.
Patrick	Boring! Next!
Patrick	Yes! And you should be prepared for worse.
Patrick	Says you! Speech!
Patrick	I'm not hearing your oral report.
Patrick	Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Spee -
Patrick	Yeah, or she probably has a robot that can demolish the whole school for ya.
Patrick	Hey, where are you going? You forgot your goggles! SpongeBob, wait!  SpongeBob!
Patrick	Hey, buddy, you got over your fear of getting an oral talking thing.
Patrick	I've been making baskets too.  Darn! This hammer is defective.
Patrick	Uh.
Patrick	I'm scared.
Patrick	Behold!
Patrick	Don't judge me!
Patrick	Um...ok!  Art!
Patrick	I'm all out of rocks! What am I going to do now? That was my thing! Oh!  Tartar sauce!  That stinks, too!  The artist needs a lunch break!
Patrick	I don't know! I'm not feeling very inspired at the moment!
Patrick	Well then, why is it on the menu?
Patrick	Oh, yeah. Keep it open. We may be here all night! Let me say up front, I'm a fan! I'm excited to learn from a genius like you. My artistic needs and knowledge are in your hands! I hope someone's writing all this. Ok........... advise!
Patrick	It's my art. Uh, I buy Krabby Patties for $3 and I..I sell them for $50.
Patrick	If you work real hard, you might be an artist too someday!
Patrick	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Patrick	I knew that. Put the slides in the projec--  ...tor. Don't worry, SpongeBob. I've got something even better.  Okay, here we go.  There I was...
Patrick	I've been waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping for my whole life without a rest. I need a break from the hustle and bustle of my everyday life.  It's so exhausting.  Help me, SpongeBob. Please, help me.
Patrick	I guess I'll just have to stay home.
Patrick	So why are we going to Sandy's house?
Patrick	Hey! Who's Carol's real father?!
Patrick	What? Oh, you can't go!
Patrick	No, it gets worse. They make you read old magazines!  Then the doctor pulls out his stethoscope.
Patrick	What else are friends for?  It appears as though we'll have to plug up these holes. This oughta do the trick.  Voil!  Feel better?
Patrick	And they said I'd never make anything out of myself.
Patrick	Uhh, uhh, that will no longer be required. He is in my care as of today.
Patrick	How...about...now?
Patrick	How about now?
Patrick	Since I ran out of space to put my stuff.
Patrick	No, he doesn't! I'm taking good care of him! Show her, SpongeBob! Say 'ahh'.
Patrick	He's mine!
Patrick	I am a good doctor, right, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Hey, wait.  Ouch! That hurts!  Wait, this doesn't seem right!
Patrick	Sure does! Um... who's Mr. Krabs again? Oh, now that cloud looks like a flying houseboat.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, can you give me a boost?
Patrick	Let's check out inside.
Patrick	Huh. So not scary!
Patrick	Even the spiders are fake! I wish something would... pop out of a closet! Like a big, hairy hand!  That would be scary!  But this place is too low budget for that!  It would be cool, though, wouldn't it?
Patrick	Look at the attention to detail in his mouth. It's so rotten and slimy.  His bad breath is incredible! His hair is very thin, too. It's dirty.  Eww. It reeks, and check out the workship on the jaw mechanism.  Remarkable-built quality!  Obviously a puppet or a robot! Hey, we must be in one of those pizza parlors, with one of those singing animated robots!
Patrick	Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
Patrick	They're good!
Patrick	Oh, please don't kill me with your death ray eyes, Mr. Ghost Robot! Take my best friend instead! He's lived a full life!
Patrick	Four years? Gotta be longer than that.
Patrick	My soul.
Patrick	Nooooooooooooooooo!
Patrick	Um, I like sprinkles!
Patrick	Here's your milkshake, Sandy.
Patrick	Check.
Patrick	Yeah, we owe you one!  What now, SpongeBob?
Patrick	"But, but... now how will we ever learn about their secret ""gorinin""?"
Patrick	Yeah, how'd you two meet?
Patrick	What is it?
Patrick	You got it. He's safe with me!
Patrick	Ooh, coral balls.
Patrick	Well, of course I am!  Now, go see your Gramma. Gary's in good hands.  Yep! Looks like it's just you and me, friend.
Patrick	Better.
Patrick	I wonder what SpongeBob's got for you in the fridge.
Patrick	Oh, Gary! Yeah, he's fine.
Patrick	Yeah, yeah.
Patrick	Doesn't that look fun?
Patrick	Oh, now we gotta dry you off. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any salt. So, I'll have to use the next best thing!  There! Doesn't that feel better? Okay!  Let's see, Gary's eaten, he's had his bath, Time to watch the T.V.!  Sheesh, Gary! Well, if you wanted another bath, why didn't you just ask?
Patrick	Oh, yeah. He's-
Patrick	Pleeease?
Patrick	Pretty please with a scoop of strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, smothered in gooberberry sauce and topped with half a can of whipped topping?
Patrick	I wasn't touching anything!
Patrick	Not... touch anything.
Patrick	Until... SpongeBob is done house sitting.
Patrick	Well, not everything is broken.
Patrick	At a handsome squirrel?
Patrick	Excuse me, sir, do you have any ketchup.
Patrick	Tummy want more.
Patrick	After you.
Patrick	Yeah, yeah. Spice.  No spice. Hmm...  Hot sauce!  Spicy bubbles. ]
Patrick	Yeah, I thinked it up with my own head. Now I'm as smart as Sandy
Patrick	I'm not sure. Let me check.  Oh!
Patrick	Don't worry. She's not going anywhere.
Patrick	Uh--uh--  Hey, everyone. Look! There's some air bubbles trapped on the ceiling.
Patrick	Looks like her color's coming back.
Patrick	SquarePants, I salute you.
Patrick	Hello?
Patrick	SpongeBob!  SpongeBob...!
Patrick	Huh? Why not?
Patrick	Yes!
Patrick	Please. Oh please...  ...please-please-please-please. Tell me-tell me-tell me. Please?!
Patrick	Oh my gosh, a quarter! I've always wanted a quarter!
Patrick	So if it's not cotton candy then what is it? I can't take it!
Patrick	This paramecium?
Patrick	Ferris wheel!  I'm ready for the greatest Valentine's present in the whole world now, SpongeBob.
Patrick	A handshake? That's the big gift? You got me a handshake?
Patrick	And not that it matters that we've been friends for so long...
Patrick	I defy you, Heartman!
Patrick	Give me SpongeBob!
Patrick	Sure it is.
Patrick	No.
Patrick	Yay! My valentine! Hey, is this solid chocolate?
Patrick	Hehe.
Patrick	Please?
Patrick	I just finished cleaning the restroom!
Patrick	Hah hah! Squidward's funny!  Hey, a button!
Patrick	Squidward?  Did you know the monster was Squidward? Well when were you going to tell me?
Patrick	Uhh. Such a tired day at the office.  Boy, am I famished, I sure wish I knew the best restaurant in Bikini Bottom.  From where has this glorious scent come?
Patrick	The hors d'oeuvres you left on the table.  Not bad.
Patrick	D'oh! Hey guys! What's shaking?  Oh...
Patrick	"""Free samples"".  Yum!"
Patrick	Say no more, buddy!
Patrick	Sounds like fun. I wish I was over there. SpongeBob's house is boring. There's nothing going on over here.
Patrick	I'm here because... wait a minute, why am I here? SpongeBob, I'm having another exit pencils crisis!
Patrick	I'm hungry.
Patrick	Say no more buddy, I know just the thing!  Get comfy!
Patrick	"And one night he nestled in the bed for a long slumber. And Sir Cecil, The sea sleep king sprinkled him with mystical sleepy dust. He couldn't have been cozier. When, without warning, an exitable sea troll bursted through the window. ""Wakey wakey sleepy doo!"" He bellowed. Then suddenly he was whisked away by eagle-winged mollusks into the night skyyyy!"
Patrick	Get up don't lie down! Get up don't lie down! Get up be active! Get up be active!
Patrick	Get up don't lie down! Get up don't lie down! Get up don't lie down! GET UUP DON'T LIE DOWNNN!
Patrick	Abra zeptadra!
Patrick	DRINK IT!
Patrick	Spongecake!
Patrick	Oh, hey, how about this?
Patrick	Right, gotcha. No problem. Not gonna make faces. No faces... at all.
Patrick	What?
Patrick	Aye yi yi yi!
Patrick	Ah ah ooh!
Patrick	Yes! But, now do you choose just one? Um, well, let's see. Oh, oh... How about an eye cross,  uh? And then slip into and overbite.  And the finishing touch. Gah lowh.
Patrick	: Hey SpongeBob!
Patrick	Actually, I can't move my face at all
Patrick	...a worthless piece of paper.  Hey, thanks, it's just what I needed, Squidward.  Nice shirt, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Look at that guy, he must be older.
Patrick	It fits like a glove.
Patrick	Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove.
Patrick	We'll miss you.
Patrick	Come on buddy. Let's take our seats.
Patrick	Oh no! What am I looking at?
Patrick	Wh-wh-wh-wh? You know I'm allergic to jumping! You know that!
Patrick	That's really gonna spoil the residents of Glove Castle.
Patrick	Yeah, or on it's last finger.
Patrick	We do?
Patrick	Hall of Mirrors!
Patrick	Oh oh! Glove Ice cream!  Thanks!
Patrick	I'm just trying to test their strength with this giant hammer.
Patrick	Yeah brother! We're chaining ourselves, through a gate.
Patrick	Oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah, you told me to keep in the safe place remember?
Patrick	I will trap Santa in my box, locked up like Fort Knox and make him stop the clocks. And then we'll have Christmas all year long!
Patrick	Nosy-body. Yay, it works! Hello, big striped shrimp. [
Patrick	Oh, no! The giant patty has eaten my buddy!
Patrick	What's this
Patrick	Hold still! I'm almost through! Perfect!
Patrick	I hired a skywriter! Oh, there he is now!
Patrick	Ooh, the Krusty Krab!
Patrick	Well, there's one place we missed. That big pile of roads!
Patrick	Your canvas awaits!
Patrick	My turn.  Five.  One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm.  It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs.
Patrick	I'm Blind Beard the Pirate.
Patrick	"Ooh! East? I thought you said ""weast""!"
Patrick	Don't cry, Captain Krabs.
Patrick	Look! The treasure map.
Patrick	I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that is there?
Patrick	We're sorry.
Patrick	Gee Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.
Patrick	Then what about this?
Patrick	Well...
Patrick	A bit dry and flavorless. I'll take two dozen.
Patrick	Whoa!
Patrick	Whoa!
Patrick	Hey! How'd we get up here?
Patrick	That's weird, my face is leaking.
Patrick	Even more brutal!
Patrick	That is one tough elderly person.
Patrick	Who is that guy?
Patrick	No! You have a special hat. Which means you get to go to your special-happy-worky place. While I just stay...  bored all day. I want a special-happy-worky place too!
Patrick	I gotta figure out what to do in my life.  Awww I wish I was a superhero.  I know what I want to do with my life! To the changing room!   Ahhhhh.  At last I have found my calling. I am Patrick-Man: defender of Bikini Bottom!
Patrick	Must I explain everything? I found what I want to do with my life! I am Patrick-Man!!
Patrick	No time for silly-talk, citizen. Patrick-Man is needed elsewhere!
Patrick	Sounds like another job for Patrick-Man!  I'll finish you off later, dale donuts. Right now I must move rapidly and act heroically!  What's this?  Don't move, and freeze!
Patrick	Hey, that's Patrick-Man to you.
Patrick	And he always finds out who hides under the mask!
Patrick	But I was about to unmask a supervillain!
Patrick	The Dirty Bubble? I wanted to unmask Man Ray.
Patrick	I've got him right where I want him. For the Pit Punch!
Patrick	Actually,  it's Patrick to you.  I'm retiring. Having a job is too much work.
Patrick	Confidentially, I'm just here for the free samples.Mmm, you can really taste the gourmet.Thank you, ma'am, I may consider purchasing this brand for my worms.Want some?
Patrick	It's so futuristic.Look, a red dot!Come back here!
Patrick	How do like that, baby?
Patrick	Hang in there buddy. we'll fix you up in no time.
Patrick	Games? Games are our middle name.
Patrick	Don't worry he'll be settled down in couple of minutes.
Patrick	Nope.
Patrick	I got gloves for my glove action-figure!
Patrick	We just passed the sign. 'You are now in leaving Bikini Bottom'.
Patrick	Bob, I don't like it here. It's dark and scary. I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. Look, I can't even tell the bathrooms apart.
Patrick	Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm coming back for ya!
Patrick	Me neither.
Patrick	Well, the smell makes my nose tickle.  Hey, it bounces!
Patrick	I can fit it in my mouth. Oh, it tastes like liquorice.
Patrick	Seems safe to me.
Patrick	Sandy's really getting out of hand.
Patrick	Oh, yeah!
Patrick	Help, help! Help!  I'm out of toilet paper in here!
Patrick	Oh, go rescue somebody else. Can't you see I'm playing with my friend, SpongeBlob?  Don't worry. I'll never leave you.  Huh?  No...! Good-bye, SpongeBlob!  Hi, SpongeBob! Hi, Sandy!
Patrick	Plankton, you're-- you're a big meanie-weenie! You won't be such a tough guy without that big old bubble!
Patrick	Whoo!  Oh, boy! Get him, you big bubble bruiser!  Whoo!  You're the man! Yay!
Patrick	Luckily, I brought the bank breaking kit! Um. How about this?
Patrick	Let's get him!  COOL! Let's do that again!
Patrick	We've been rumbled! Run! Scatter! Scamper! Save yourself!
Patrick	Oh, dang. We hardly even saw it.
Patrick	What?! Not again!
Patrick	It's like we're heroes.
Patrick	We can't get home.
Patrick	The Fisherman!
Patrick	Maybe if we don't look at him he'll go away.
Patrick	What? Come on, bossman! If we can't eat anything, why are we here?
Patrick	A big ghost?! I thought we were- we were conjuring a rib roast! I'm outta here!  I'll get help buddy! Just get me away from this freak!
Patrick	Wow!  Oh, that'd be like me forgetting to-- Oh! Oh, oh, oh... Oh, there you are, pocket taco.
Patrick	:  Sweet Neptune! Uh, SpongeBob,uh, I'm going to gonow. Your obsession with Kenny is getting weird.
Patrick	Fly away, little critter!
Patrick	Do you think she knows the Muffin Man song?
Patrick	Wait until she sees the...
Patrick	Then can we say people from Texas are dumb?
Patrick	Uhh, stupid?
Patrick	Why? You think that old slowpoke Texas is gonna...
Patrick	Yeah, who needs dumb ol' Texas?
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob! Why are you making me so sad?
Patrick	Frothy frappe?
Patrick	Great. See you then.
Patrick	I'll just save this for later.  Now you try.
Patrick	Come on, SadPants. You know what always picks me up?
Patrick	Here ya go, little buddy.  Ahh. Mmm!
Patrick	Yeah, this is dee-licious! Does it have any side effects?
Patrick	: I'm here for lunch.
Patrick	: Mmm, Quadrants!
Patrick	: Is that what you call it?
Patrick	: Now, where's my executive treatment?
Patrick	: Here's your 20 bucks.
Patrick	: But! But!  Save my sandwich for me, Squidward! Squidward!
Patrick	: I think Ive forgot to water my manatee oranges?
Patrick	:  No I dont!
Patrick	: Do you slap your palms down on the table like that too?
Patrick	:  And so in conclusion, I would like to submit my official report.
Patrick	: Who is it?
Patrick	: Nuh-uh.
Patrick	Ha. Whatcha doing, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Feed 'em to who?
Patrick	So... I guess I'll be going then.
Patrick	Well, if it's snail friends he wants, it's a snail friend he's gonna get.
Patrick	Meow, no! No, meow!
Patrick	I'll just have 47 Krabby Patties please. I had a big breakfast so I'm not that hungry.  Squidward did you get a new haircut?
Patrick	Ah! Oh no that's gonna hurt!
Patrick	I like whistles!
Patrick	Oh, why didn't you say so.
Patrick	I don't get to taste?
Patrick	I don't want to eat in the contest it hurts my taste feelings.
Patrick	Okay, i'll do it for the little boy with the hurt foot.
Patrick	No, this thing doesn't even fit!
Patrick	Well, maybe I'm supposed to run around with this sheet we spread on the ground!
Patrick	Makes them?
Patrick	I invented a game! I invented a game!
Patrick	"It's called...  ""Tic-Tac""! You start with two lines that are crossed. And then the first person puts an X. And then the next person puts an, uh..."
Patrick	"I should've gone with my first idea: ""Tic""."
Patrick	Sandy, I've been trying to invent a game, but every game I invent is a failure.
Patrick	It's a game! It's a game! Now I know what it's like to be a game maker!
Patrick	No, my friend. We have only just begun.
Patrick	You mean for picking our player or for starting the game?
Patrick	Oh, on your next turn, you roll then you can move down the board or you can go round the race track as many times as you rolled.
Patrick	Oh, you don't get to roll when you're in jail.
Patrick	Ah, here it is!  The guy that is in jail has to stay there unless he rolls a six or someone says his name.
Patrick	No wait, Squidward!
Patrick	Tell it to the judge!
Patrick	Four. We are in a giggle zone! Everyone laugh!
Patrick	Hey man!
Patrick	Natural greeting returned.
Patrick	Oh! Oh! Yeah!  I want an A+ too!
Patrick	Yeah?
Patrick	We're an awesome team!
Patrick	I'm in charge.
Patrick	I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge.
Patrick	Uh...
Patrick	Oh boy! Let's go!
Patrick	You got more ice cream!
Patrick	I'm in charge!
Patrick	Hmmm...  Rub my feet first!
Patrick	Don't you back-sass me! I'm in charge and you have to do what I say! Now, count that bucket of white sand.
Patrick	Yes I am.
Patrick	You heard Sandy! Open the door!
Patrick	I was a monster! I deserve a Z-!
Patrick	Hooray! I win!
Patrick	Now that was a great thumb war, mister!
Patrick	Uh, yeah, I guess. I probably won't even be able to do good flipping.
Patrick	Just how are you gonna do that?
Patrick	Then prepare to be pinned!
Patrick	We saved the rec center!
Patrick	But my home's not for sale.
Patrick	Yeah. All because of Nick Fishkins.
Patrick	Don't forget to make a garage for our new boat!
Patrick	Well, he hasn't paid us yet!
Patrick	A rock band?
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob.
Patrick	There's no such thing!
Patrick	What's going on?
Patrick	He flips houses for a living?
Patrick	"He said ""Yeesh! Who'd wanna live in that thing? Not sold!"""
Patrick	He's in the house. He's impressed.
Patrick	No, no, just
Patrick	No, that's too fancy.
Patrick	I'm already a star.
Patrick	Oh, I'm sure glad you made it to my party.
Patrick	"""Tastes so nice that they"""
Patrick	But he's my friend.
Patrick	See you later, SpongeBob.
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	SpongeBob?
Patrick	Mm! Now that's a real Krabby Patty! Oh, as delicious as our real friendship.
Patrick	That... that...Frozen Krabby Patties are...
Patrick	Yeah, we just give them away.
Patrick	Good, we can use the wood.
Patrick	I know.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!
Patrick	Hey, Sandy!
Patrick	Uh huh.
Patrick	And I'll never forgive her if she runs out of Nutty Butter!
Patrick	Hello!
Patrick	Oh, yeah. He's cool because He's a nanny-mouse.
Patrick	Well, he probably meant his stomach was dark and empty and he was hungry for more.
Patrick	Oh, not yet!
Patrick	Yeah, I think.
Patrick	I spy with my little eye...
Patrick	The world's least exciting sweater! My parents fell in love there! We gotta go!
Patrick	It was an accident that it fell into my mouth!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob. You look tired. You want me to guard the patty for a bit?
Patrick	Ow!
Patrick	Mmm! Krabby Patty!
Patrick	Duh!
Patrick	You thought I was dying!
Patrick	Firetruck clowns, check!
Patrick	Whoo-hoo! Check and check!
Patrick	Uh, don't worry! I've got this!  Yep!
Patrick	"""An edible balloon, a skateboarding snail, a tower of loose meat that tastes like ice cream, some ghosts..."""
Patrick	Mmm! Stickerific!
Patrick	Okay, I will!
Patrick	Aww, darn it.
Patrick	I still have a baby tooth?
Patrick	Nobody's gonna tell me what to do with my baby tooth! This tooth is staying in my mouth!
Patrick	Rock a bye baby on the treetop
Patrick	Nothing! Just, uh, practicing being a seal!
Patrick	Who's got baloney?
Patrick	The worms!
Patrick	A likely story!
Patrick	Okay, SpongeBob. We can go.
Patrick	You're going under my pillow so you can go to Tooth Island my sweet boy!
Patrick	How can I believe you? All the lies!  The chicanery!
Patrick	Hey! Where do you think you're going, chum chewer?
Patrick	Rude. Hey, the light changed.
Patrick	Is it hot in here or what?
Patrick	Three?   Three challenges is nothing. Might as well make it 500 challenges!
Patrick	Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?
Patrick	It was nice knowing you, buddy!
Patrick	Yes, SpongeBob?
Patrick	No, I want it!
Patrick	Oh!
Patrick	I feel you.
Patrick	Yep, that's him! Hi, Squidward!
Patrick	Get ready, get set, punch it!
Patrick	I'm taking it easy, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Yeah, my brain won't fit back in.
Patrick	Aww, man! That felt all squishy!
Patrick	Yay!
Patrick	We're watching you!
Patrick	Evil found its match today! Underwater justice and fair play!
Patrick	You did a great job with casting.
Patrick	What? Oh, hi, Patrick. What's shaking?
Patrick	You leave my best friend alone!
Patrick	Good, SpongeBob! I had the same answer.
Patrick	Hello?
Patrick	Hey, that's great!
Patrick	SpongeBob? What's happening?
Patrick	Oh, yeah.  Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie. Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie.
Patrick	Eureka!
Patrick	Well, it sounds good to me.
Patrick	Not bad. Okay, get on my shoulders.
Patrick	Oh, I got it.
Patrick	Me neither, SpongeBob!
Patrick	A rock.
Patrick	Fancy foods! Get your fancy foods here!
Patrick	Mine!
Patrick	Ahh! Oh, behind me! Oh, get away!
Patrick	But I can't fit through there.
Patrick	Thanks! I like...um...your antennas.
Patrick	Oh boy, life insurance!!  Life insurance, life insurance, life insurance, life insurance!  What's life insurance?
Patrick	I've become unbreakable!
Patrick	Okay.  Squidward was wrong. Didn't hurt him, just made him disappear.
Patrick	Sea spider!
Patrick	Yeah! To test out the life insurance, we even built a super dangerous obstacle course across the street!
Patrick	Whoo-hoo!
Patrick	Mm-mmm.
Patrick	Wish I could, SpongeBob, but I'm kind of busy spending time with my boat right now.
Patrick	Hmm, how much is it?
Patrick	Uh, very well, then. Hey, Sponge, can I borrow another quarter?  Thanks.
Patrick	Technique.
Patrick	Good morning, Krusty Krew.
Patrick	I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier.
Patrick	SpongeBob, let me ask you something.  Does this look dangerous?
Patrick	You just jump off before you get too high.
Patrick	Hi Ho, Silverfish. Away!
Patrick	I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride em up, and up, and up, then you gently flow down.
Patrick	Well, I had my fingers crossed.
Patrick	See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm going to go have some fun.  Come on SpongeBob. You know you want to.
Patrick	Oh.  No! My ice cream! Ooh, why is the world so full of pain?
Patrick	An ice cream geyser!
Patrick	Oh, SpongeBob, I wouldn't say that.
Patrick	Poke.
Patrick	Hmmm... pointy.
Patrick	Really?!  How many gallons are wasting when we leave a sinking shower running?
Patrick	Uh...  Wouldn't you rather see them on...  My hands?
Patrick	Gosh... Probably not.
Patrick	I'm sorry!  I won't interrupt anymore!
Patrick	Oh, poop deck, You're right!  We'll have to do this lesson   later! Bye SpongeBob!
Patrick	Brush, brush, brush! Brushing everywhere!
Patrick	It's too bad they're old.
Patrick	Who are you people?!
Patrick	Uhh...
Patrick	Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!
Patrick	Hi.
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Maybe it's your voice.
Patrick	Ugly.
Patrick	As long as I can remember. You poor ugly thing, you.
Patrick	Say it. Say it.
Patrick	Good! Say it louder.
Patrick	So whaddya wanna do now?
Patrick	What is wrong with you people?!  Afraid to look ugliness in the face?  Well, here! Look at it!  It's ugly, isn't it?!  You look at it!
Patrick	I bet there's no line at the snack bar.  Hello...? Hello...? They must be on break.
Patrick	My hands aren't that dirty...  Hey, you guys want to hear a bathroom joke?
Patrick	Why? Oh, no reason. Except you gave me the ugly!  What am I gonna do? I can't go out looking like this!
Patrick	Oh my gosh, if my sister finds out, wait, I don't have a sister, if the bank, I mean it's one thing if you have bad shoes, or even bad hair, but...
Patrick	Some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
Patrick	Stink?
Patrick	Haha. Jellyfish, beware! Patrick Star is here. Jellyfish. Oh, how do you hold this again?  There. Got ya!  This isn't over! Hey, I'm not done with you.  I could really use SpongeBob's jellyfishing expertise right about now.
Patrick	Oooooohhh.
Patrick	Ditto.
Patrick	See for yourself.
Patrick	Ice cream!
Patrick	I'm never gonna get an award because I haven't done anything.
Patrick	I wanna defeat the little monkeyman and save the 8th dimension!
Patrick	A job at the Krusty Krab?
Patrick	Do I get my award yet?
Patrick	Ok.
Patrick	Ai Yai, Captain
Patrick	No! This is Patrick!  I'm not a Krusty Krab.
Patrick	Why can't I do anything right?!
Patrick	Ow, it burns!
Patrick	Yeah. Remember when I had my up? And I put it on the lid?
Patrick	Good morning, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Uhh, me, too.
Patrick	So I can win an award like you.
Patrick	At least I'm safe inside my mind.
Patrick	No, we won't.
Patrick	Are you kidding? I used to do this way before I started copying you.
Patrick	Patrick's not here!
Patrick	I'm gonna go protect my title.
Patrick	Aww, but they're so cute.  Oh, hey there, mama jellyfish.
Patrick	Community service. It's a long story.
Patrick	Naah, I'm good.
Patrick	"It's just my new dance move. I'll call it... ""the horrible mistake""."
Patrick	Yeah, it is.
Patrick	Frozen Krabby Patties are...
Patrick	Come here!
Patrick	Krabby Patties taste so nice, that...!
Patrick	You know, SpongeBob. Krabby Patties taste so nice, that they taste nice!
Patrick	Oh, I'm sorry.
Patrick	No. I love 'em 'cause they're popular.
Patrick	And one sponge and one sea star!
Patrick	Oh, yeah.  That was a close one!
Patrick	Whoa... That is-
Patrick	I'm not a big fan of waterfalls... I prefer to stick to the rivers and lakes that I'm used to.
Patrick	Uh, bless you.
Patrick	Is mayonnaise an instrument?
Patrick	I'm not Patrick?
Patrick	Hey, he must be one lucky guy.
Patrick	Oh, I didn't even know it was a building!
Patrick	Hey, how come I'm not in this one?
Patrick	To our fallen comrades.
Patrick	And wasn't much of a cuddler either.
Patrick	I know this one! It's the Eiffel Tower!
Patrick	Oh, I can totally do that! I could!  I don't have to talk! Ha, just watch me. Not gonna talk!  I'm not talking now!
Patrick	Crabmeat is delicious!
Patrick	It's a rule there.
Patrick	It was not filled with hamburgers as one might expect.
Patrick	A..An ugly princess?
Patrick	Ok.
Patrick	Oh, it's a birthday for me! It's a birthday for me! And it is so happy! Because it's...
Patrick	No. The lions are scary.
Patrick	Oh, to carry their keys!  And snacks!
Patrick	If you're interested, have your people talk to our people.
Patrick	We are all moving North! We can't live here anymore! It's too hot!
Patrick	Kitchie-kitchie koo, koo.
Patrick	Why must the sun set on this perfect day? Sleep well, Wormy.
Patrick	"He left his ""Best Friend"" ribbon behind!"
Patrick	"Now what? We're trapped in here with that...that--""Best Friend Eater."""
Patrick	It's for you!
Patrick	I really don't taste that good, Mr. Monster.
Patrick	I'll never forget you, Wormy.
Patrick	Aye-aye, captain.
Patrick	Attention, Bikini Bottom! There's a flying monster that's going to eat you!
Patrick	My head is saying yes, but my tummy is saying no. And I always trust my tummy, so, no.
Patrick	Ask later. I'm busy.
Patrick	Oh, I love being purple!
Patrick	Hooray for SpongeBob! Hooray for SpongeBob!
Patrick	What? Why?
Patrick	I'm supposed to get a toy with this.  Thanks.
Patrick	Yum!
Patrick	He can do it in 9!
Patrick	She's pretty, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Hi.
Patrick	Hey, I thought you didn't have a driver's license.
Patrick	Who's the kid now?
Patrick	Oh, yeah. All right.
Patrick	SpongeBob, look!  Our car!
Patrick	Sorry.
Patrick	I had to go to the bathroom.
Patrick	I'm trying. Trying so hard.
Patrick	Good morning, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Mashed or scalloped, sir?
Patrick	Whoo!
Patrick	I can't hold the mayo any longer!
Patrick	Good morning, Squidward. I'll have the usual.  With cheese.
Patrick	I...need...Krabby Patties!
Patrick	Oh, yeah. Well, if you're SpongeBob, then what's the secret password?
Patrick	Yeah, Mr. Krabs says you and Plankton took it.
Patrick	BECAUSE I...NEED...KRABBY...PATTIES!! Hurry up! I'm hungry! Over here!  Guys? Am I still on the team?  Hey, what are you looking at?
Patrick	Nice try, but it's gonna take more than that to--
Patrick	Cheese!
Patrick	My feet hurt.
Patrick	What's happening? I feel tingly.
Patrick	Ahh...Where have you been all my life?
Patrick	How does it end?
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	I can't see my forehead. What's your problem?
Patrick	Awww! I gotta draw a new battery for this.
Patrick	Sorry. Stupid inflatable pants!
Patrick	Come again, sir!
Patrick	The dirty therapy seems to be working just fine.
Patrick	You know how grandmas are, they love babies. You just can't act like a baby around her.
Patrick	Now, you must acquire a taste for free-form jazz.  Okay, SpongeBob, you're ready!  This is it. What are you going to tell Grandma?
Patrick	Oh yeah, right.
Patrick	I'm the baby, I'm the baby, I'm the baby!  Being grown up is boring. I love being a baby. Besides, I don't get jazz.
Patrick	Oh boy! Storytime, storytime, storytime!
Patrick	Oh, boy, I hope it's cookies!  Alright, another hat.
Patrick	Um...
Patrick	Like this...
Patrick	Ying!
Patrick	I guess we've got to order inside.
Patrick	Oh hello.
Patrick	And Sandy's hedge clippers?
Patrick	I don't know. What do you want to do today?
Patrick	It's just borrowing, right?
Patrick	Yeah, then we can go to the beach with the balloon!
Patrick	And over a rock!
Patrick	I got the air!
Patrick	Hi-yo-hoo!
Patrick	I'm on it, SpongeBob!
Patrick	I wanna go home.
Patrick	Hey.
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	I'm way ahead of you, buddy!
Patrick	Oh, I'm nothing but a lot of talk! You're the one with the sticky fingers.
Patrick	Oh!
Patrick	I can't find it!  Where could it possibly be?  Ahaha!
Patrick	You took my only food,  now I'm gonna starve.
Patrick	Liar, liar, plants for hire.
Patrick	Don't!
Patrick	Ah!  [As SpongeBob puts the bar through his head and moves them left to right.] Ah!  You're a crazy person! I should have expected this after the way you stole that balloon!
Patrick	I'll beat you there!
Patrick	You said it!
Patrick	Like a genie. (Laughs)
Patrick	There's no words on this paper.
Patrick	Uhh, SpongeBob...  Thanks.  Dear Sant...  D'oh! Not again.
Patrick	Another piece of paper.
Patrick	Never trust a genie.
Patrick	Look, she's on the Eating Channel.
Patrick	SpongeBob, look at this!
Patrick	It's okay, SpongeBob. This stuff is water! Look!
Patrick	Looks like an over-inflated Sandy doll!
Patrick	Faster, faster!
Patrick	Faster, SpongeBob! She's gaining on us!
Patrick	Yeah, all's I got is this bellybutton lint.
Patrick	You'll never catch me!  Hey that's not fair! Cowboys couldn't afford cannons.
Patrick	I'm dirty.
Patrick	I'm Dirty Dan.
Patrick	I'm Dirty Dan.
Patrick	Hot wings?
Patrick	Let me have a try.  Open sesame!  Well, I've done all I can do.
Patrick	I'm so cold that...I'm shivering!
Patrick	It's like a gold mine, but with fur.
Patrick	This is taking too long! I want the warm NOW!
Patrick	You said it!
Patrick	I'm it! I'm it, I'm it, I'm it, I'm it!  Tag, you're it! I win, I win!  What's with Gary? He sounds like a motor boat!
Patrick	Brush brush brush,  Brushin' everywhere  Nope.  Oh, hey, here he is!
Patrick	And then we'll make a house of cards, and then we'll read some comic books
Patrick	Great, SpongeBob. Watch this! Wherever I go, Gary follows!  See?
Patrick	I don't know, but I do know Gary knows who he wants to go with. So I suggest that you put him down and let him choose.
Patrick	Would it be all right if me and Gary did some laundry around here?
Patrick	How pathetic
Patrick	Patrick.
Patrick	Oh great! Who are they?
Patrick	Music isn't best either!
Patrick	This guy's good.
Patrick	Yeah! You're feeling it Squid! That's it, all the way! The last 6 miles, make that Squid! Go, go, go!
Patrick	Here comes Squidward!
Patrick	Yup, he's still mad.
Patrick	Touch.
Patrick	What's so great about a nerdy pickle?
Patrick	Well, SpongeBob, I'm glad you learned your lesson.  Hero worship is unhealthy.  C'mon, Jeffrey.
Patrick	What about the invisible boat mobile?
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, how come he's not chasing us?
Patrick	Well, that's not a question.
Patrick	Nope, it's not mine.
Patrick	Yup.
Patrick	Oops, sorry. Can I start over?
Patrick	My wallets.
Patrick	Wrong!
Patrick	Peanuts?
Patrick	What's that smell, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Ignition, on!
Patrick	Uhh...
Patrick	That's a good one, huh, Sandy?
Patrick	Better at what?
Patrick	Thank you, thank you.
Patrick	Our fitting!
Patrick	Yeah! Yeah! Woohoo!
Patrick	This is the greatest day of our lives? Boring!
Patrick	Now this is a show!
Patrick	Are you sure you didn't see anything suspicious?
Patrick	Where were you on the day of today? Don't play games with me, mister!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob!
Patrick	I get what I deserve!  Ouch.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!
Patrick	Squidward!
Patrick	Yes!
Patrick	We'll do anything you say!
Patrick	I don't get it.
Patrick	Moving behind the rocks!
Patrick	Or an oversized coffee mug?!
Patrick	Let's do it.
Patrick	Make it five.
Patrick	Wait! I think it belongs to me!  Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
Patrick	Uhh...
Patrick	Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!
Patrick	Hi.
Patrick	What is that thing SpongeBob?
Patrick	Psh, artists.
Patrick	No, I mean it's swimming away!
Patrick	Life is good!  Easy come, easy go!
Patrick	It's Squidward, silly!
Patrick	He's going to the door.
Patrick	Maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple.
Patrick	Can't we just stay down here where it's safe?
Patrick	He's hideous. He makes me sick, just looking at him. Those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie!
Patrick	Happy birthday!
Patrick	Done and done.
Patrick	So... he's a drawing?
Patrick	Oh, boy, am I!
Patrick	You do?
Patrick	No... way. Oh, let's hear another one!
Patrick	No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.
Patrick	Never!  So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club!  Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants!  If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore!
Patrick	Seee... cret.
Patrick	Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?!
Patrick	Our friendship ring! IT IS YOU!  How could you do
Patrick	Well, didn't I tell ya?  Isn't it great?
Patrick	Good thing he didn't pull the secret string, opening the...  ...secret compartment of my secret box...  ...revealing one embarrassing snapshot of SpongeBob at the Christmas Party!  Merry Christmas, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Whoever is the owner of the white sedan, you left your lights on.
Patrick	Oh boy! Three A.M.!
Patrick	Sleeping.
Patrick	Polo!
Patrick	"You know something, SpongeBob? It's just all fun and games for you. Nothing really matters.  ""Oh, let's go jellyfishing! We don't have any work to do! Life is just a big bowl of fancy assorted cashews, and nobody has anything to dust or to clean or to wipe! Or fabricate!"""
Patrick	Look!
Patrick	SpongeBob, my parents think I'm dumber than a sack of diapers.
Patrick	But don't geniuses live in a lamp? And besides, we don't know any dumb people.
Patrick	W, X, Y and Z!  Hi Mom. Hi Dad.
Patrick	I'll go get the beverages.
Patrick	Mom, Dad, meet my neighbor, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob! You wanna stay for dinner?
Patrick	"Oh, that's nothing.  You should see him in the morning prancing around yelling ""I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!""  He drives all the neighbors crazy!  Why, just the other day, our neighbor Squidward was--- . ---was really no help for him.  I mean, look at the way he's dressed. Only somebody with holes drilled in their head would wear that stuff! And how about his shape! I mean, I've heard of barrel-chested,  but never box-chested!  Hey, SpongeBob do you have any  I could borrow?"
Patrick	Oh, I guess the dummy wants to have a private conversation.  A dumb one!  So, what's on your mind? Oh, wait, I already know the answer. Nothing!  See, that's funny. 'Cause your dumb!
Patrick	"Oh, SpongeBob, if only you could see how stupid you sound right now, with your talk of imaginary plans. Tell you what. You've caught me at a good mood. I'll humor you. Go on, go out there and act ""smart"" for everyone."
Patrick	That must be actual size.
Patrick	Hi, garbage man. Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	You use them when you want to talk fancy. You just sprinkle it over anything you say, and Wham-o! You've got yourself a spicy sentence sandwich!
Patrick	Pretty  good, SpongeBob.
Patrick	That's a lot of  bad words!
Patrick	Oh, eels. Too bad, SpongeBob, you gotta ride the eel.
Patrick	Es-skee-lators!!  Well, this is your last chance, SpongeBob, or if you get eels again, you lose!
Patrick	Don't worry SpongeBob, I understand.  Mr. Krabs! [runs out the door] Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!
Patrick	See ya at the Krusty Krab! Ha, ha, ha!  Oh no!
Patrick	Oh, no!
Patrick	Nine...
Patrick	Games? Can I play?
Patrick	Oh, come on. You're just flippin' patties.
Patrick	Fingernails! Fingernails! Fingernails!
Patrick	Yellow!
Patrick	Check it out!
Patrick	Yellow!
Patrick	I'm mean!
Patrick	That's what you think, but it's not over yet.
Patrick	I don't like you more!
Patrick	Pink?
Patrick	You know, these were white when I bought 'em.
Patrick	It's what you are!
Patrick	Wow, Squidward, you're choking!  Uhh... uhh, I know what to do, but I should wash my hands first. Oh, well.  I win!
Patrick	So what are we gonna do tonight, best friend?
Patrick	Likes Patrick more than SpongeBob.  Oh!
Patrick	Squidward?!
Patrick	How about some for your best friend?
Patrick	Squidward!
Patrick	Oh, yeah...
Patrick	Hey, Squidward!
Patrick	Hey, Squidward!
Patrick	That's horrible!
Patrick	PUSH!
Patrick	I could look at it all day.
Patrick	Just a minute, Ah!  I could have sworn I was laying on my back.
Patrick	Ice cream?  Did somebody say ice cream?  Where is it? Is it here?  Huh? Ice cream, yay!  Cramp!
Patrick	I'm drowning cause I crossed the line!
Patrick	Help, help!
Patrick	Goodbye, ice cream.
Patrick	What did he say?
Patrick	We told you you wouldn't fit in.
Patrick	Yeah. You could be bald and have a big nose.
Patrick	The shell knows all!
Patrick	Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
Patrick	Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay.
Patrick	Hi, I'd like to place an order for delivery.
Patrick	No, they're not closed. I know, you want olives.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, when do we stop hopping?
Patrick	See, Squidward? It works! You try!
Patrick	Check.
Patrick	I'll take it easy when I'm dead! I'm shaking hands with Neptune! Whoo!
Patrick	What should we keep down?
Patrick	Why not?
Patrick	Don't forget the second avalanche.
Patrick	Whoopee! Another box!
Patrick	Beep-beep-beep.
Patrick	Yeah, see you in the morning.
Patrick	Ehh? Huh? Oh. Hi SpongeBob.
Patrick	And then comes a giant fist!
Patrick	Well, sure. But it'll be with someone his own size.  Like this pickle! See? They like each other!
Patrick	Come on! You know... I wumbo, You wumbo, He she me...wumbo? Wumbo, wumboing, we'll have the wumbo, Wumborama... Wumbology, the study of wumbo? It's first grade, SpongeBob!
Patrick	You're kidding!  Good thing I still got this pickle!
Patrick	I got a surprise for you.
Patrick	Listen carefully. What's pink and square at the same time?
Patrick	Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you.
Patrick	Got your apple ready?  Lucky undergarments? Hold on. Hold on.  Bingo! Underwear, apple, and me. You're ready to get that license. Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff! Act natural.
Patrick	No, no, put it in drive.
Patrick	Left.
Patrick	What?
Patrick	Yeah! I didn't think we'd get Mrs. Puff out of jail this fast!
Patrick	Snow angel!  Oh...  Hey!  Thanks a lot, SpongeBob! While you were just standing there whistling, someone threw a snowball at me!
Patrick	Oh, yeah. A snowball.  Oh, this is gonna be great!  Huh?  Wha...?  Aw...! SpongeBob, could you help me make a snowball?
Patrick	That's me!
Patrick	Can I use your bathroom?
Patrick	Please?
Patrick	Yay! Squidward's on my side!
Patrick	Hey, you can't talk to Mr. Krabs like that, Squidward!
Patrick	That fort's too small, Squidward.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob?
Patrick	What are you doing?
Patrick	I only got seven.
Patrick	I'm always here on Double Weenie Wednesdays.
Patrick	No, SpongeBob, you can't. It's too dangerous.
Patrick	Who, me?
Patrick	Oh yeah.  No, please wait.  No, please have mercy!
Patrick	Give me that hat!  I said give it to me! Are you going to hand it over or not? Don't you back-sass me!
Patrick	Well I didn't say anything.
Patrick	What's the matter, is he stupid?
Patrick	SpongeBob SquarePants, are you crazy? That's not the right food for a little fella like him!
Patrick	What now?
Patrick	How do you think?  And I've been doing it all by myself for almost a year.
Patrick	You're right. If I was a mom......this would be kind of shocking.  Just call me Daddy!
Patrick	I never thought being a parent could be this much fun.
Patrick	Kid's got a stinky.
Patrick	I'll give you a break tonight when I get home. Don't you two stop being adorable.
Patrick	That guy got hit in the head with a coconut!
Patrick	Work was a killer! I need my chair.
Patrick	Uhhh.
Patrick	I changed his diaper!
Patrick	So?
Patrick	Six o'clock.
Patrick	Six o'clock.
Patrick	Somethin' about root beer, right?
Patrick	I'm going back to work.
Patrick	Oh, so this is the thanks I get for working overtime?
Patrick	It means working when you're just too tired to work!
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	Goodbye, Junior.
Patrick	A one-way ticket to pain!!
Patrick	Well that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final!
Patrick	That will never ever come off.
Patrick	Well that was a rip-off.
Patrick	Yeah, SpongeBob?
Patrick	I think you are over-reacting SpongeBob, I don't see any paint.
Patrick	Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something!
Patrick	Nope.
Patrick	This is all Mr. Krabs' fault! If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place!...I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. Why hang it? You could just stick any old dollar bill on the wall, no one would even know the difference! You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall! And it would...
Patrick	Yeah, you don't have to look around. We already did that for you.
Patrick	I don't want to be butt-less!
Patrick	I thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it.
Patrick	Oh, most certainly, sir!
Patrick	Style!
Patrick	Yeah, yeah!
Patrick	Not lame!
Patrick	We're ghosts.
Patrick	Boo.
Patrick	Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite!
Patrick	Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!

Patrick	Thanks, Sandy.
Patrick	Mrs. Puff, it's us!
Patrick	Well, because we can't breathe in Sandy's treedome, remember? It's filled with air.
Patrick	Oh, SpongeBob, that's a great idea! Where should we goJellyfish Fields, Goo Lagoon, Barg'N-Mart, Lucky Larry's?
Patrick	We're lost.
Patrick	I can't hold your eyelidsthey're too slippery!  Ow!
Patrick	Yeah! Are you okay?
Patrick	Oh. The Fisherman's here.
Patrick	I don't want to die in my underwear!
Patrick	Hi SpongeBob!
Patrick	Oh, sorry. Can I use this outlet?
Plankton	Oh, uhh, it says,  'Discuss the secret ingredient of the Krabby Patty formula.'  How interesting.
Plankton	Pretty please?
Plankton	...I don't know. I never thought I'd get this far.
Plankton	I don't want to talk about it.
Plankton	I'm a failure!
Plankton	I don't get it. No matter what I do, I always end up being squashed by someone bigger than me.
Plankton	Uh...
Plankton	Will you please-!
Plankton	Well, what do you want?
Plankton	I have the restaurant surrounded. Give me the secret formula or I'll destroy the Krusty Krab!
Plankton	You're right. The pipes are much too narrow. Besides, what I really want is the Krabby Patty formula.
Plankton	Eh, and, of course, I had a little help from the family.
Plankton	I don't care. Drum roll please!  Finally, after all these years, I'm about to find out what makes a Krabby Patty taste so good.  The secret recipe for one Krabby Patty is... a pinch of salt...!
Plankton	...mixed together with the most important ingredient of all... four heaping pounds of freshly ground...!  ...Plankton?!
Plankton	Come on!
Plankton	Hope, hope? When I get my hands on that formula, there won't be any hope for any of you.  Yeah, I mean: you'll be cured in no time.
Plankton	Good, and what are they made of?
Plankton	Work.
Plankton	See, the key is to say something different than what I say.
Plankton	I've laid out some words on cards here. These words are common kitchen ingredients. I want you to arrange them in any order you choose. It could be a poem or a secret formula. I don't knowoh yes! A secret formula. Good, let's do that.
Plankton	No, hypnosis.
Plankton	But what about the formula.
Plankton	Thank you for your patronizing words, computer wife.
Plankton	Oh, the pain! I can't feel my arms and legs! I think they're broken. I'll have to sue for my pain and suffering.
Plankton	I'll give you one last chance. I'll drop the charges if you give me the formula.
Plankton	Yes, your honor. I'll try.  I wasn't always the tortured shell of a protozoa that writhes in pain before you today.  I... was a vibrant, carefree, happy-go-lucky, single cell.
Plankton	Ahem! Are you quite finished?  Now where was I, oh yeah. But the worst part is...my dreams of completing a marathon like I promised my old Grammy have been dashed.  I'm...I'm sorry Gram-Gram...sorry.  Thank you for your kind attention.  Suckers.
Plankton	No more questions.
Plankton	Huh? No, no, no!
Plankton	C'mon, it's a standard marketing technique.
Plankton	Everything I do is always wrong in your eyes.
Plankton	Why did I ever buy that computer wife? I need a real woman--not a girl in a cold-hearted shell.  Such beauty. She's an angel; and no wires. I've never felt like this before. I don't even know her name and yet she's stolen my heart.
Plankton	And now to woo that beloved creature.
Plankton	Wait! This is your secret admirer.
Plankton	Sounds wonderful. I'll be the tall fellow wearing a red carnation. Until tonight, my dear.
Plankton	Is my tie on straight?
Plankton	It's across the street.
Plankton	"""Mommy?"""
Plankton	You heard the lady. Let me go.
Plankton	I'm serious, Eugene. I've changed my ways. And all it took was the love of a beautiful woman.
Plankton	Not family, eh? I can fix that.
Plankton	Attention, attention everyone. I'd like to make an announcement. Mrs. Krabs, in full view of this restaurant, I ask you for your hand in holy matrimony.
Plankton	Too late Krabsy. We're going to be married. And you're gonna be my new son!  Huh? What's this, honey bunch?
Plankton	I don't want to hear your lies! You owe me for leading me on like this! Give me the Krabby Patty formula and we'll call it even.
Plankton	Nothing, dear.
Plankton	I thought Sandy was the boom operator.
Plankton	This is humiliating. I'm not good at this boom thing.
Plankton	I surrender!
Plankton	Exactly! They've all been just attempts. And every single one a miserable failure. I can feel my arteries clogging up with anxiety just thinking about it.  Let me show you something.  Look at this place!
Plankton	No! These are knickknacks for the new gift shop I'm opening up.
Plankton	Ah, would you look at that? I have a feeling I'm going to like this new life of novelty items.
Plankton	Oh, I get it. You caught me red-handed.  Those were the days, huh Eugene?
Plankton	Thanks, but no.
Plankton	GET OUT!!
Plankton	Coming, coming.  Yo.
Plankton	Yes. I'm still here.
Plankton	Yes. Yes, I would like that very much.  I guess I won.
Plankton	Oh, no, no, come on now. No gifts.
Plankton	You sure?  Life is good, Krabs.
Plankton	Holy Moley, how'd that happen?
Plankton	They're multiplying. Why, they're on every corner.
Plankton	Let's do this thing.
Plankton	You better believe it. This high-powered mechanical bio-arm I invented should pry those restaurant doors open nice and easy.  What the barnacles? Come on, you piece of garbage.  Ouch! Uncle! Uncle!
Plankton	Keep her going, Krabs. At this rate, we'll have the Kelpshake's recipe faster than you can say...
Plankton	I don't see you on the front lines. Sure, let me do all the work, while you just sit back like the fat gorilla you are!!
Plankton	Release your grip, man. Do it!
Plankton	Not if I can help it.  Ow.
Plankton	Krabs, we're all out of juice.
Plankton	Come to papa.
Plankton	Surprise!
Plankton	Goo!
Plankton	Did you hear that, Krabs? By flipper burgers for those cretins, he was able to gain their li-spect.
Plankton	There you are, sir.
Plankton	Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world!  And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
Plankton	Oh, either one will do.
Plankton	Why don't you tell them the truth?
Plankton	Gimme that!
Plankton	It was only our third date.
Plankton	Well, he is old.
Plankton	Stop, you're gonna...  You wanna fight over this recipe, I'll give ya a fight you'll never forget!
Plankton	Aha! We'll let the customers decide whose burger is better. Step right up, gents. Get a delicious Chum Burger right here.
Plankton	I'll show you, Krabs! I'll steal that cursed recipe from you one day, and I won't stop till I do!
Plankton	It's all I ever really wanted. To get back to the way it used to be. You and me against the world! How about a hug, Krabs, old pal?
Plankton	Go, Karen!
Plankton	Whew! Gosh, it's hot.  AAAAAAAAH!
Plankton	Could I interest you in a raspberry iced tea?
Plankton	Oh, I will. We'll see if you have any customers left after I pump up the volume.
Plankton	I win! I always win!
Plankton	I almost had it 37 times, and you know it!
Plankton	Here you go, Eugene.  One a-dollar.
Plankton	I knew you'd be too stubborn to turn the heat up. Let's see how long you keep those customers when you give them the cold shoulder.
Plankton	Well, if it isn't the wind beneath my wings.
Plankton	Hey, SpongeBob. long time, no see. What've you been up to? How was your weekend?
Plankton	Uh-oh.  Whoa!
Plankton	Run, you fools. Run!  It's working. I'm actually going to get a Krabby Patty.  Come on, get out of the way! You're blocking the exit.  No! No!
Plankton	You see, Krabs. you can't defeat me.
Plankton	Okay, boys. Karen wants this place to really sparkle. I was thinking it could use a little more pizzazz.
Plankton	Well, hop to it, lads.
Plankton	Yes. If only there was some way I couldWhere'd he go?
Plankton	Yeah, I think they're so cozy. Now that's what you call art.
Plankton	See, SpongeBob. Patrick's using the old noggin. He knows I'll actually want to see out the window.
Plankton	Well, that ought to keep them busy for a while.
Plankton	...restaurant, bug. I think we've been through this one before. Allow me to do the honors.
Plankton	Krabs!
Plankton	AAHH!
Plankton	Something about that woman reminds me of my mother. That's it! Finally, victory will be mine! I'll turn Eugene Krabs into a powerlessbaby.
Plankton	Yes, my plan is working perfectly, now that I've turned Krabs into a helpless baby, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine! Hello.
Plankton	Not sure.
Plankton	Right.
Plankton	Hands in the air!
Plankton	Peek-a-boo!
Plankton	I'm getting old listening to this. Let's try this again!
Plankton	Victory is mine!
Plankton	1 squirt equals baby, carry over the 2 plus the square root of SpongeBob. Of course! The final ingredient I'm lacking! It's so simple yet so evil! And I know just where to get it.
Plankton	Ow ow ow!  Baby powder? This could be just what I need! Hey buddy, is this made of real or artificial babies?  Ow ow ow ow!  That powdered baby did the trick! Now my baby gas can't possibly fail!
Plankton	Karen! Speak to me!  It worked!
Plankton	Put me down!  Ow! Stop it! I'm an adult!
Plankton	They're gone. Now to get to those weapons...  Trapped! Ok, what do I have to work with here? What's this? Owners manual!? Looks like I found my escape route!  Owe!
Plankton	Ice cream? It shoots ice cream?!?  Oversized ice cream maker!  Yah! Ouch! Ow!
Plankton	Krabs calls that a commercial? Who'd fall for that schlock?  Say... Something is going on over there.
Plankton	What's that? A souvenir from your boyfriend Krabs?
Plankton	Oh, Professor Plankton, Door-to-door salesman.  My card.
Plankton	"Ew!  Couple of studs like you can't go around like this. Lucky for you, Dr. Plankton's come prepared with ""Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo"". A little of this stuff and the ladies will be breakin' down your door."
Plankton	Ooh! This is too easy. Now just tell everyone that...
Plankton	...let it be known that I, Mermaid Man prefer the delicious food available at the Chum Bucket.
Plankton	I did it! I did it! Look at all these customers.  In your face, Krabs. Yes!
Plankton	A traveling restaurant, eh? It's not fair! I had that idea years ago! No matter. If Mr. Krabs wants to play dirty, then Plankton's ready for his turn to take his turn.
Plankton	Um, no.
Plankton	I'm Plankton, you old hag. And your son smells like boogers.
Plankton	You people are crazy. I'm getting out of here.  What the? [People start throwing rocks] No! Controls malfunctioning! [people continue to throw rocks]
Plankton	Yes! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the...  Ah, who needs that old Rust Bucket anyhow.
Plankton	Happy day, Karen! That fool Krabs changed the name of his restaurant to the closed Krab! Everyone will think it's closed, and come eat here instead! He'll be ruined by tomorrow!  What an idiot!
Plankton	Oh, out to celebrate.  Don't wait up for me!
Plankton	What are you talking about, you gargantuan buffoon?
Plankton	Being a ruthless mastermind sure takes a lot outta here.
Plankton	Oh dear.
Plankton	Ha-ha! Those fools will never find me now!  Oh come on, baby. You know how long I've been in stir.
Plankton	He's singing about the Krabby Patty. If I could just get him to explain that song, I'll have the Krabby Patty formula!
Plankton	"But could you explain those ""wee"" parts?"
Plankton	What, me? I'm not trying to steal the patty formula!
Plankton	Sure, whatever.
Plankton	T-shirts.
Plankton	Stop it!
Plankton	Just take a seat here, and I'll strap you in.  Now just relax and let the equipment do its job. let's see what's locked in his subconscious.
Plankton	At the Krusty Krab?
Plankton	Why? Uh, cops are autograph hounds. Yeah, they're always after me.
Plankton	Uh I'm ready?
Plankton	But I liked my old cell.
Plankton	Get ready Krabs,  for the surprise of your life!
Plankton	This will prove to be my greatest evil scheme ever!
Plankton	Brought to you by yours truly. So without further ado, let the mauling begin!
Plankton	That pink dimwit doesn't stand a chance with those sausages around his throat! As soon as the smell of sausage hits that ravenous lionfish's nostrils, he'll be all over Patrick like mold on a shower curtain!
Plankton	Just ten dollars please.
Plankton	Here you are. I'm sure I've made a satisfied customer of you all ready.
Plankton	Chum on a stick. Get your chum.  What the?  Oh great! Now how am I going to entertain the masses?  Hey watch where you're...  Oh dear!  Phew. Good thing I thought ahead, with that escape door. Try and catch me now, you prissy feline!  NO! Nice kitty. Want some chum?
Plankton	Yes, and after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that...that just wasn't fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don't want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don't know what it's like to be a loser.
Plankton	Haven't you degraded me enough for one day?
Plankton	That naive cube! How long must I suffer this?
Plankton	Alright, SpongeBob, I'll play your little game.
Plankton	Stingers?  All knees will bow to Plankton! Hail, Plankton! I win, I win!
Plankton	Never! That's completely idiotic!
Plankton	Well, I like it. Let's do it again!
Plankton	The what?
Plankton	What?
Plankton	Thanks for that, friend.
Plankton	Okay, okay, I see it! It's a Krabby Patty, okay? I couldn't help it!
Plankton	No, not really. Being evil is too much fun!
Plankton	What was me?
Plankton	Sorry, I really have nothing for you.
Plankton	But, it's my version of a Krabby Patty.  After thousands of failed attempts to steal the recipe, I learned all but one ingredient needed to make Krabby Patties. The most important ingredient, the secret ingredient. Over the years, I've methodically gone through almost every letter of the alphabet. Right now I'm on the R's. And I've gotten up to raw sewage.
Plankton	Same as always, look! Empty again.
Plankton	Away with you! Can't you see that I'm self-loathing here?
Plankton	Uh, okay if you insist.  Oh no, please don't sue me.  I can't believe someone actually enjoys my Chum.
Plankton	Huh? Nat? Hello? Huh? What?  Uh, it's closing time. I should have known it was too good to be true.
Plankton	Well, it's your lucky day, Nat. I happen to have a quite delectable one, right here.
Plankton	Oh, well, you know.
Plankton	Don't bother. There's no need.
Plankton	Nat, back all ready? That's the fifth time today. Not that I'm surprised. Karen. babe, get Nat here another plate of that sweet Chum.
Plankton	And that doesn't look like Karen.
Plankton	Ouch, double irony!
Plankton	Back for more of my delicious Chum, I see!
Plankton	All this time, I never had one regular customer?
Plankton	: Oh, Karen! I think this is it! The Chum Stick that's finally gonna drive Krabs out of business!
Plankton	: I lost my restaurant because of you! And I thought  was evil...
Plankton	Sorry, no time for your senseless chatter. I've got a customer to attend to!
Plankton	Any time. What is wrong with people?!
Plankton	Oh come on! When we first met, you were little more than a jumbled mass of diodes and wires. I made you what you are today!  Literally! So don't think you couldn't be replaced in a heartbeat! Ow!
Plankton	Oh yeah! I don't need you! I can make a whole army of computers that might actually help me steal the formula!
Plankton	Could you come here for a moment?
Plankton	Good morning T-119A.
Plankton	I can see how someone of your level of technical knowledge would think that Karen, but in actuality what you are looking at is... oh, right.
Plankton	Because you were the one that said...
Plankton	Not that one!
Plankton	"Well maybe I could iron out a few bugs, but then you'll see just how much I need you!  Karen? What's this?  It's words on paper. It says: Dear Plankton, I've logged onto another network. I just can't go into sleep mode at night knowing that you'll continue blaming me for all of your failures. Anyway, you're a grown single celled organism, and allowed to make your own syntax errors. Nice knowing you, Karen. ""Dah! who needs her!? Not me! I'm going to steal that Krabby Patty formula from Mr. Krabs once and for all. And then we'll see who's made the error.  Ow!  P.S., don't forget to blink. Oh yeah."
Plankton	All right, then let's do this! T-119A to position!  SPU-31 to position! Command Module to position!
Plankton	I'm here for the secret formula you twit! Now I want you to go in there and tell Krabs that if he doesn't turn over the formula to me, that he'll be subjected to utter annihilation at my... Are you getting this?
Plankton	Hey, what gives?
Plankton	Oh, I knew you couldn't stay away, I knew it!
Plankton	Or we could go out!
Plankton	Well, uh.....  ...like those customers, who just pulled up.  Well, hello, gentlemen, and welcome to the Chum Bucket! Would you like seating inside or outside?
Plankton	Now what was I saying? Oh right . I'm tired of the Krusty Krab taking all of my buisness! We're doomed, Karen! Doomed, I tell you!
Plankton	Now let's see, Q no... P no...Ah, here it is, L! There, it's perfect! CHUM IS METABOLIC FUEL!. You really did it this time ol' Planky. Oh yeah, who's a genius. Have you seen this, seen this, seen my genius, genius, genius, genius.
Plankton	Friend? I didn't even know y-
Plankton	OK, Freakshow, you just wait. In a few minutes this sign will attract more than you can count.
Plankton	"What the? This says ""Chum is Fum."" You've changed my sign to ""Chum is Fum?"" That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
Plankton	Excuse me, would you like a free sample?
Plankton	Ah hehehehehehe  Chum is fum! Ah he he!
Plankton	Agh. Oh well, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Keep up the good work...I guess...
Plankton	You see, every time I make a sale the sound goes there, Watch!
Plankton	PATRICK!
Plankton	Here's your Chum Bucket Supreme, enjoy! Patrick my boy, you really earned that promotion!
Plankton	But you're my whole marketing department.
Plankton	The aroma you speak of, Karen, my computer wife, is the stench of failure!
Plankton	Stop that at once! You!
Plankton	Although I do look ravishing, it's not enough to mask the ugliness I feel inside!
Plankton	What?
Plankton	The Krabby Patty formula!?  How did you get it!?
Plankton	Oh, it's nothing. It's just that today is my wedding anniversary.
Plankton	My what?
Plankton	Lump.
Plankton	...vvv...
Plankton	Well, she's a Mark-2 Surplus Unevec with 256 Gigs of RAM and uh, and there's the cutest little mole on her CPU, and the way she processes data... Eh-eh oooh mama!
Plankton	Who me? I can't sing.
Plankton	EEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whew!
Plankton	I don't think I'm ready.
Plankton	Oh, I have it. It's right here in my kidney... I mean, heart!  Me me me meeee...me me meee... Oh my Karen. Oh my Karen. Oh...my computer wife, Karen. Put down those punch cards. Put down those punch cards. And listen to my ode. Oh my Karen. Oh my Karen. Oh...my computer wife, Karen. What compares to. What compares to uh... uh... eee... uh... umm...  Aha! Your beautiful diodes! Oh my Karen. Oh my Karen. Oh...my computer wife, Karen. I was blinded. Yes I was blinded. I was blinded by the light of your cathode ray. Oh, I built you.  Yes, I built you. I built you in the, uh....  Um... In the shape of a cube. Oh my Karen. Oh my Karen. You'll never know how much I love your vacuum tubes
Plankton	Yes! You porous kitchen utensil! By helping me woo my computer wife, you've just doomed the Krusty Krab!
Plankton	Here it Comes!
Plankton	But you're shorting out.
Plankton	E-M-I-L-P? What's E-M-I-L-P?!
Plankton	Oh, yeah? You try getting launched.
Plankton	Karen?!
Plankton	Oh, Karen.
Plankton	Thank Neptune that's over.  Uh-oh.
Plankton	Oh, you couldn't possibly bore me.
Plankton	Wait!  Wait! Hold on!
Plankton	Hey, Krabs. uh, happy eleventy-seventh?
Plankton	Did you see that?
Plankton	I knew this baby would come in handy.
Plankton	Barnacles! Now what?
Plankton	The majesty! I've never seen such beauty.
Plankton	Man, I'm good!  Cave dwellers!  Back! That's better. From now on, you shall be my minions servants to follow my every order! I decree this kingdom to be called the Chum Caverns! And may the people of Bikini Bottom shudder in awe of its Majesty! Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Plankton	Krabs? What are you doing here?
Plankton	Heh, heh, heh! How does it feel, Krabs? Being in the hole, so to speak. Not well, I'd imagine. Now hold still so I can bury you.
Plankton	Ha! There may be no way out for you, Krabs, but you needn't worry about me! My diminutive stature allows me to slip through rubble with ease.
Plankton	You're right, Krabs. Let's bury the hatchet now and forever!
Plankton	I am, and I will!
Plankton	Oh, please. I can cause far more collateral damage than that!  Karen, where'd you put my death ray?
Plankton	Here we go...
Plankton	Eeeew!  No water! Can't breathe!
Plankton	Sandy Cheeks? But where's her fur?
Plankton	Our ticket to the Krabby Patty formula, that's what that is!
Plankton	Heh heh. This is going to work like a charm.
Plankton	That was close. I gotta perfect that Texas drawl.
Plankton	Lemme stop you there, SquarePants. I'd be much obliged to know how y'all make one of them there patties.
Plankton	An' approximately how long do you cook a patty?
Plankton	Oh-ho ho, man! That secret formula is as good as mine.
Plankton	That's nice. That's interestin'.
Plankton	Aaugh! This is getting so tedious!
Plankton	It's finally mine! Time to kick this baby into four-paw drive!
Plankton	Eh, that's the life.
Plankton	You? You're just a computer. I'm the evil genius around here.
Plankton	Your tour?
Plankton	Yes.
Plankton	Wow, that's a pretty good idea. Whoa! Um, Karen? Whoa!
Plankton	No! Wait!
Plankton	Ugh. great.
Plankton	Oh Boy! He's gonna make a Krabby Patty in front Of my eyes!
Plankton	Let me see what I can tune in here. Hmm.
Plankton	Ow! I hate my life!
Plankton	"""Patrick's favorite places to be scratched""?"
Plankton	Karen, wouldn't that be stealing?
Plankton	Louse what up?
Plankton	Next Chumstomer, please.  Well, Well, Eugene Krabs!
Plankton	Wha?
Plankton	Yummy Bunz huh? Well you're gonna have to try a lot harder than that Krabs, once the hungry public hears about MY newest creation.
Plankton	Uh, Officer! Officer I would just like to state for the record that umm,  this was all his idea! All of it!
Plankton	I really can't come outside!
Plankton	All right, so I've been stealing your mail for the past five years, big whoop.
Plankton	Because the whole city has already approved it! See for yourself, through this conveniently-timed flashback.
Plankton	Well, then; Your wish is my command, Sponge!
Plankton	Cause I'm gonna love every minute of this!  Did you hear that?
Plankton	Good effort, SpongeFool, but you can't destroy my highway, it's indestructable!
Plankton	Ha ha ha ha! Enjoy, Eugene!
Plankton	No need to get worked up with this Krabs, just give me the secret formula and off I go.
Plankton	Still not going to talk 'ay' Krabs?  OK Krabs, I see you're still not going to crack but I don't think your underling is of the same metal.
Plankton	Say what am I smelling? you got something burning?
Plankton	Stay back whale! I'm pippy to what you do to organisms like me. I've seen those documentaries!
Plankton	I hear that mocking tone in your voice Karen, and I don't appreciate it! Don't you remember what happened to my ancestors at the hands of those beasts?
Plankton	There's a whale in the laboratory!
Plankton	Karen! Karen--!
Plankton	Grand-Dad?
Plankton	Go away, CheeseHead! Can't you see I'm trying to get run over? In fact, better yet just step on me as hard as you can, will ya?
Plankton	What, do you have mud in your ears? Take a hike!
Plankton	So, you're saying that this whole time it was Krabs masquerading as a whale!?  Why that conniving bottomfeeder!
Plankton	Oh, is that so.
Plankton	See for yourself.  Enjoy the show!
Plankton	Ahhhh! Not another feeding! Get me out of here!
Plankton	Yea, uh Id love to help, but I really got to go.  Ouch.
Plankton	: Uh, no, chocolate. Open up!  You can let go of the spoon now, Grandma. There. Oops, looks like you've got a little on your face. Here, let me.  There you are. There you are, darling.
Plankton	": Ooh. Uh, uh, now, now, Grandma, just relax. There, there.  That's perfect!   Why didn't I think of this before? No one can say ""No"" to a helpless little grandma! Excuse me, Sonny, I'd simply love one of your Krabby what's-it's, but my delicate digestive system has special needs, and I'll need to see a complete list of ingredients. You wouldn't want me to be up all night with painful bloating, would you?"
Plankton	: It's me, your dear old great-grammyma!
Plankton	: Never let it be said that I didn't suffer for my occupation.
Plankton	: Actually, SpongeBob, I said I wanted to seelife, remember?
Plankton	": Why, yes! Heh, heh, heh, heh... What I meant to say was, ""More, please."""
Plankton	: No, I'm getting hungry. I can feel my own stomach acids eating away at my organs.
Plankton	:
Plankton	: Okay. I'll be standing right here when you get back, and not off somewhere snooping around for the secret formula or anything.
Plankton	: Oh! I'm all right, but I've been ground to a pulp. If only there was a nice, cool, safe place nearby, like a nearby, where I could rest and recover.
Plankton	: Sweet dreams, indeed, fool. Only this dream is about to become a nightmare, forHa, ha, ha, ha, ha...!I'm just going to savour this moment, because for once in my lifefor once in my lifeI feel
Plankton	Vermin? You take that back!
Plankton	What stupid question do you want the answer to? Idiots.
Plankton	Why on earth would Krabs tell those two blunderers about the Main Drain?
Plankton	Come on, Krabs, don't you have any respect for tradition?
Plankton	Wait! Wait for me!  Barnacles, I knew I should have sprung for a taxi! Curse you public transport! Why I oughta--  Oh, now they're on time.
Plankton	You calling me a liar?
Plankton	Oh brother.
Plankton	Aha, that's how you stole it! Give it to me. Give me the key.
Plankton	Here, maybe I can help.
Plankton	Over here, choo-choo heads.
Plankton	What? B-b-but how?
Plankton	Yes! Now the Chum Bucket is the only restaurant in town!  Nuts.
Plankton	Jackpot! And now to  the secret recipe.  Careful. Careful.
Plankton	Quiet, Karen. Just bring me more prunes.
Plankton	Okay, now what's he saying?
Plankton	"I said, ""What'd he say?"""
Plankton	Healthy and Clean, Fresh Batch of Krabby Patties? Ooh, I think I smell a plan!
Plankton	Of course you do! That's why I must tell you about our limited time offer. Where not 4, not 3, but 1 luxurious night here! At Club Shell! A perfect resort for snails. Don't try to pinch yourself this could be...
Plankton	Wha...?
Plankton	I've never felt better! Uh, I mean... meow!
Plankton	Meow?
Plankton	Whew! I'm glad that's over.
Plankton	Oh, boy...
Plankton	Uh, mommy?
Plankton	No! It's the day I steal the Krabby Patty secret formula from Krabs!
Plankton	Sweetie, you're going to help me achieve my defined purpose, aren't you? And steal the Krabby Patty recipe! Muhahahahaha!  It's ready!  Oh, boy. he says.  Whew! Man, is it hot in here.
Plankton	Finally, the moment has come!  No, No, No!  NNNOOOOO!!!
Plankton	Huh? Wait!
Plankton	Um... I guess.
Plankton	Oh, just plug it into that doohickey over there
Plankton	Yes, that's right. And don't let the door hit you on the way out!
Plankton	Rodger!  Urgh! Just a sec.
Plankton	Shut it down.
Plankton	Fire!  Ow.
Plankton	Hahaha! You failed! I've finally stolen a Krabby Patty!
Plankton	Aw, man (says pouting). I stole the Krabby Patty fair and square.
Plankton	Forget it, SpongeBob. Nothin' will make me friend with Eugene Krabs.  What is that delicious smell!?
Plankton	That was fantastic!  Forget the Krabby formula. I must have the Flabby Patty recipe.
Plankton	Bet ya don't!
Plankton	Sweet Flabby Patty, here I come!
Plankton	Look what that skin flint did to my antennae.
Plankton	I'm a restaurant critic, so I get cutsies.
Plankton	I did better than you, Eugene!
Plankton	Why am I on the bottom?
Plankton	Yeah, you like that!
Plankton	Now, now, Krabs, SpongeBob has taught us important life lessons, such as, oh, how to fall out of an airplane for instance.
Plankton	Now I'll be able to get a Krabby Patty the simplest way possible: By ordering one!  Ahem! I would like to order one Krabby Patty please! Uh, extra Secret Formula!  Hello!? Is this stupid thing on!?
Plankton	Watch where you going old man! This is the second time!
Plankton	I see you. Zap!
Plankton	Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot!  Yeah! Huh?  Yow!
Plankton	Take a hike!
Plankton	Alone at last! Now there's nothing between me and the secret formula! Hahahahaha!
Plankton	Fire in the hole!  Rats.
Plankton	Surely, the safe couldn't survive nuclear detonation. Come to papa!
Plankton	Well it would have happened if I could've dislodge this stupid cork!
Plankton	Babe don't blow an on amp over this, c'mon!
Plankton	I'd be delighted to see you try! Ooooooh, you're so close.  So long suckers!
Plankton	Got any dipping sauce? A little taste of your own medicine aye crab cakes?
Plankton	Well I suppose dear old dad was right. I should have minored in business administration.
Plankton	The skinny one. He's been ranting and raving in front of the Krusty Krab for the past half-hour, waving his arms and jumping around like an animal. Oh, he stopped now. He's just broken down on the ground, crying. Karen, Karen, for the first time, it's hit me!
Plankton	Down here! I am just an innocent passerby who felt the need to stop and tell you what a magnificent garden you have.
Plankton	Well, that's not exactly why I
Plankton	Hey, buddy!  Squidward!  Free cleaning service?  Census taker.  Good day, kind sir. Would you like to buy some Gil Scout cookies?  Ow!
Plankton	Out of my way, SpongeBrain.
Plankton	Oh, is that right?
Plankton	Uh-oh. I mean, goodie.
Plankton	Bravo!
Plankton	That's the word I was looking for!
Plankton	Say, uh, musical genius?
Plankton	Well, I... I was just wondering, O incredibly musical one, what do they put in one of those Krabby Patties, anyway... secret-wise?
Plankton	What?
Plankton	You'll never catch me, you hear! Never!
Plankton	No, wait! Please! Karen, help!
Plankton	Salutations, puny mortals! I am the great genie of the slide carousel! WHOOOO! Endorse my vacation slides or I shall grant you three miseries!
Plankton	What are you, mocking me, kid? Of course everything's not okay. I can't show my slides!
Plankton	Well played, Krabs, well played indeed. But, as usual, this one-eyed creepy-crawly is one step ahead of you!  You can't beat Plan B, you can't beat it! Ah, this is going to be so sweet! Karen, we are going on a luxury cruise!
Plankton	Yeah, it's going to be groovy, babe. Now a quick check of the vacation inventory. Suntan lotion, sunglass, death laser...
Plankton	Nothing tops kicking back next to my loving computer wife and soaking up the rays.
Plankton	Um, oh, the d'oeuvre guy, he's late with my nibbles again.
Plankton	Un! Eh! Un! Un! Eh!
Plankton	Yeah, heh heh, sure is.  Uh, just sit back while I massage your wheels.
Plankton	AGGHHHHH!  I hate you, Krabs.
Plankton	I don't care anymore! Formula or no formula, I'm taking you down!
Plankton	That's all? Why certainly, he he he.
Plankton	Well, technically it's your first.
Plankton	Trust me, you don't want to know.
Plankton	Maybe your right. That would explain why I stink at darts.
Plankton	Binocular vision, here I come!  What? Oh mamma! Stop, I command you!  Oh, come on, please stop!  Next.
Plankton	Tears, huh? I guess if I have to.  Ow! Will these do?
Plankton	Once upon a time, there was a yellow doofus who loved to drink milk with his lunch. But unfortunately for said doofus, his milk was tragically spilled.The end.
Plankton	You tell me.  Bullseye! Now for my next target  the Krabby Patty secret formula!  Hahahaha!  Wha-?  Why does everything look so weir- ... look so beautiful!
Plankton	Honey, I'm home!
Plankton	Hmm. Looks like a pretty butterfly!
Plankton	A bouquet of flowers! Would you like some flowers, honey?
Plankton	I'll help you! Do not worry, citizen, I'll catch you!
Plankton	Hey Eugene! You missing anything?
Plankton	Oh, it's this cursed new eye! I've got to get rid of it! Must become monocular again.  Hahaha, I did it!
Plankton	What, NO! NOT HUGS!!!!! It's gone. That disgustingly good eye is finally gone! I'm cured! Thank you, thank you all! Especially you, SpongeBob.
Plankton	Don't worry, Krabs! I'm just taking out the trash for ya!
Plankton	ACHOO!!!!  Blasted pollen allergies!  Ahh, I should be safe in space.
Plankton	Really?
Plankton	Turn myself in? What?! If I go down, we all go down! You're harboring an art thief!
Plankton	And not only that, but Gary's an accomplice too!
Plankton	Ohh, he's an accomplice too!
Plankton	No. I mean getting the public to try some! Once everyone gets a taste of my delicious chum, they will tear this place apart to get some. Plus it's free, and who can resist free!  Step right up for your free samples of delicious chum!
Plankton	Eat up.  I have no idea that chum was this rotten. I better not be here when all this agony turns to anger.
Plankton	That's it.
Plankton	I can't really believe how well this is turning out for me today.
Plankton	No, wait! What's going on? You hate Krabby Patties remember?  Uh-oh.
Plankton	Karen, your memory banks are gumped up again. I did not request chum pot pie. I requested chum stir fry.
Plankton	Karen 2!
Plankton	Hey, come on, babe. Don't take it so hard. You'll find love again. Maybe you'll meet a nice...uh...adding machine.
Plankton	Uh, uh. Let's not do something we might regret!
Plankton	Tonight we celebrate and tomorrow the secret formula.
Plankton	Wait! This isn't getting me any closer to the formula.
Plankton	Karen! Don't you leave me, Karen. Not again.
Plankton	Come on. let's go home to the Chum Bucket, honey.
Plankton	You'll pay for this, Krabs. I'm calling the Bogus Business Bureau.
Plankton	This round goes to Plankton.
Plankton	Yeah!
Plankton	You heard him, Krabs. Give me a Krabby Patty.
Plankton	Oh, come on. Are you kidding me?
Plankton	Ugh.
Plankton	Finally. At long last, the Krabby Patty is mine. Go ahead and wrap that up, son. I'll take it to go.
Plankton	Oh, come on.
Plankton	There's no time. I can feel it digesting.
Plankton	Oh, Santa, Santa, Santa has his eye on me. He's seen everything I've done. Every plot, plan, and scheme. It's just a bit of fun. Santa has his eye on me. Every naughty deed is written in his scroll. So every Christmas morning, I get a stocking full of coal!
Plankton	Hot from the oven and full in lovin'!
Plankton	Maybe just a little bit jerky?
Plankton	Grrr! Have some more!  Have a baker's dozen!  Well?
Plankton	This just keeps getting better and better.
Plankton	Oh, SpongeBob, you've been a bad, bad toy!
Plankton	Frica-what?
Plankton	Yeah, what's up?
Plankton	Thank you, sir. Come again. Enjoy your leftovers.
Plankton	My restaurant!
Plankton	99 feet!
Plankton	Oh no I'm not!
Plankton	That does it!
Plankton	Karen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Plankton	How much you got?
Plankton	Thank you, thank you! I've got what I need!  I got the signatures!  All but one. Guess I won't be hiring the yellow sponge anytime soon.  But none of that matters now! Cause the majority is on my side! Which in a democracy is all you need.
Plankton	What?! Excuse me, sir, but, uh...  you forgot to level the place!
Plankton	Gasp!  Hopping Hamburger Stands! I gotta go home and get my wallet!
Plankton	Look, I know I'm an evil heartless mastermind, but no one can ingest raw chum and survive!
Plankton	Heh! Heh! Finally! I have a fool-proof plan to steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula! Krabs will never recognize me wearing......these glasses!  What in the seahorse is going on around here!?
Plankton	Hold on! You haven't seen it in action yet!  I'll just set it for our query.  No... Ignore that one... Ah ha! Bingo! You have your orders, ATTACK!
Plankton	Oh, come on! There's gotta be a better way!
Plankton	This getup is one hundred percent humiliating. Here urchin, urchin, urchin!  Here you dirty filth-spreading porcupine. I'm wearing lipstick here. Come on, let's go!  Huh? What was that? Look sharp Planktonella. I think we're being watched  Ah!  Uh...hello?
Plankton	I heard that!
Plankton	"Excuse me. Doesn't this count as ""cruel and unusual punishment""?"
Plankton	"No! Uh, no. The ""secret ingredient."""
Plankton	Phew...
Plankton	Hey! I need that! For my bones!
Plankton	Hey! I'm in here! I'm Plankton!
Plankton	With this pack of criminals, I can steal the Secret Formula like that!
Plankton	Yeah! Good old chum. Say what now?
Plankton	But have you tried it on a bun?
Plankton	Hmm...you there! Sniff this sock! Yes...let us begin! Cultured fungus growth medium!
Plankton	Hey you! Blow.Live bacterial culture.Now, to secure the containment vessel. Agitate primarily compound! And quality inspection! Ok boys! I think it's time we evacuated this institution!
Plankton	Launch me!
Plankton	Oh my! That is a dilly of a pickle! Oh well, if you cannot escape through the back wall, I guess we have to leave through the front door! Quickly my fellow felonons! FOLLOW ME TO THE KRUSTY KRAB!!!
Plankton	Did you tried looking in the safe?
Plankton	What's happening!?
Plankton	Wow, phase two is great! My favorite phase so far.
Plankton	Wow! A fellow spatula enthusiast, I see. You're right, SpongeBob. But with a few modifications, it'll serve as the end-cap for my SizzleMaster.
Plankton	SpongeBob, it's a magical spatula with a legend. This is a one-in-a-lifetime experience.  Onward to the Chum Bucket!  Hey it's this way, kid.
Plankton	Yes, SpongeBob. I believe the SizzleMaster has found its fry cook in you! The legend of the SizzleMaster has been fulfilled.  And since your are its fry cook, it will reduce your workload tenfold!
Plankton	That's right, SpongeBob! Let's show this lunch rush what for!
Plankton	Hey Sponge, I know a way to double our productivity. I'll handle things here at the grill, alone, while you man the condiments, huh?
Plankton	It sure was, SpongeBob. And maybe tomorrow I can even handle the grill for you, huh?
Plankton	Oh, I am so much more than a patty flipper.
Plankton	Infiltration complete. Time to execute phase five!
Plankton	Would you like me to man the grill for you today?
Plankton	Oh, SpongeBob, I'm sorry. I just wasn't used to this grill. All of the Krabby Patties are gone.
Plankton	Yes! Karen, begin production!
Plankton	Krabs?  Oh, no.
Plankton	I could think of a few.
Plankton	That rodent's right. A giant goo bubble could really level the playing field. If someone were able to control its power, they'd control all of Bikini Bottom. And I'm going to be that someone.
Plankton	All right, Karen. I'll make sure I write that down in my book, titled,
Plankton	Yeah, it's me.
Plankton	Ha! They'll never catch me at this rate!
Plankton	Aw, don't go so soon.  I hope you brought your dancing shoes!  'Cause it's time to do the electric goo-boogaloo!
Plankton	Oh, yeah? Well, look again, you dingus!
Plankton	Well, this is interesting. Let's see where it goes.
Plankton	That's it, no more messing around! Give me that formula or I'll destroy this stinkin' town!
Plankton	A company picnic, eh? That gives me an idea.
Plankton	Come now. Can't we all just share? Nothing should spoil this perfect day.
Plankton	You're all welcome to join us of course. There's plenty of fun for all.
Plankton	And of course, the dunking booth!
Plankton	Say no more, my friend.  If you'd care to work for me, just sign this contract with this delicious candied pen.
Plankton	Uh oh.
Plankton	Attention, beach-goers! You are trespassing! You have exactly seventeen minutes to haul your carcasses off the future site of the  'Chum Bucket Mega Bucket.'
Plankton	Yes. He's the one.
Plankton	SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  SPONGEBOB!
Plankton	That's right.
Plankton	Not in-sertive!  SpongeBob, you missed your chance! You've got to be aggressive to get the things you want! You're too soft!
Plankton	Tell him off, SpongeBob. Assert yourself!
Plankton	Those were tears of joy I told you! He was happy that you were assertive!
Plankton	SpongeBob, this is your next lesson. Be aggressive! Tell that guy to take a hike!
Plankton	Oh, nothing, SpongeBob.  I was just beginning to think that this was a waste of time.
Plankton	SpongeBob, you'll never get what you want! You'll always let people step all over you! You're just like stairs!
Plankton	Look at that huge line at the hot dog stand. Assert yourself to the front!
Plankton	Exactly.
Plankton	Huh? What are you doing?  Wait, SpongeBob! Stop!  Butterfly kisses. Can't take it. It's too cute! It's... it's disgusting!
Plankton	Why couldn't I see it before?  The way to get the Krabby Patty formula was so obvious!  Spend an inordinate amount of time training several dozen sea bears to take over your restaurant and force you to give it up!  can turn them from their central purpose!
Plankton	Heh-heh-heh...
Plankton	you now...?
Plankton	...just as I planned.
Plankton	Eeeeeeee...
Plankton	Oh boy, here it comes!
Plankton	You're not gonna crush me?
Plankton	More fruit punch, SpongeBob?
Plankton	Just lay face-down and keep still.
Plankton	Are you sure?
Plankton	Now, remember. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and your assignment is to ask Krabs for the secret Krabby Patty formula.
Plankton	Are you sure? Because you're sweating. []
Plankton	Me Two? I'm such a deep sea dope! Now that the copy's gone in contact with the original SpongeBob, he won't tell me the formula.  Time to adjust my plan.
Plankton	Yuck! Now listen. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and you're to go straight to Mr. Krabs  and ask him for the secret formula.
Plankton	He's doing it. He knows the formula. I can taste triumph! Wait, No! No!
Plankton	I'm gonna know the formula! I'm gonna know the formul...
Plankton	It means my plan is ruined! All the SpongeBob copies will fade away now!
Plankton	What's the formula?! []
Plankton	You wouldn't want all those copies of you around. They were just imitations anyway.
Plankton	Well, what do you know about that. No comeuppance!
Plankton	Barnacles, woman, would it kill you to leave me alone for five minutes!
Plankton	Wow, I can't tell if you're sarcastic or psychic.
Plankton	Let the wave of misfortune begin.
Plankton	The scheme is working perfectly, and here comes gullible Krabs now to hand-deliver the secret formula. I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
Plankton	I guess I didn't really think that through.
Plankton	Hey! Mommy!
Plankton	Now to make my escape.
Plankton	Eh, forget it. What's the world coming to?  All right, just give me one Frozen Krabby Patty to go.
Plankton	Say what?
Plankton	That's right, everyone. Gather in real close.  Time to trigger the stench!  Yoink!
Plankton	I'm not hungry!
Plankton	Pleasant night, eh SpongeBob?
Plankton	Why, hey there, little fella!  Is SpongeBob..  I mean your master at home?  Eh, perhaps I could just come inside for a minute and demonstrate our fine snail products.
Plankton	Your friends won't tell ya this, but you can really use the slime deodorant, Smelly!
Plankton	Note to self: Nitroglycerin is not a substitute for vanilla extract.
Plankton	Where is it? Where is it? Gotta be here somewhere.
Plankton	Where the barnacles is it?
Plankton	Alright, Snail! Let's go! Just you and me!
Plankton	SpongeBob's hidden the secret formula inside Gary's shell! Sheesh! This place is disgusting! I bet it reeks. Good thing I don't have a nose. Huh?  Aye yae yae!
Plankton	The heavenly light! I always knew I'd see it once I've gotten the formula! Let me bask in its glory!
Plankton	I don't get it. A crab's brain is smaller than the point of a pencil, but he keeps outsmarting me!
Plankton	Nagging Neptune!  Back you twisted tongue! You will not lick me!
Plankton	Idiot sauce!  I'll serve it to Krabs and it'll make him so dumb, he'll just give me the secret formula! Huh? Huh?
Plankton	You not Plankton! Me Plankton!
Plankton	Cook books, eh? You holdin' out on me, Krabs?
Plankton	I'll never learn!
Plankton	It's the last day of school, baby. No need to be formal. Call me Sheldon.  Great Neptune! That's perfection! Well, with this recipe, I could own the most popular fast food restaurant in Bikini Bottom!
Plankton	But... but you were just about to give me the formula! Y..You were scared of me!
Plankton	Check-mate.
Plankton	Hey!
Plankton	Thanks.
Plankton	Ridding SpongeBob of his worms will put him forever in my debt. That secret formula is good as mine!
Plankton	What? What is it, Karen? Can't you see I'm working there!
Plankton	I said not now  oww-oww!
Plankton	Oop! Okay, let's all calm down before you say something you'll regret!
Plankton	Fine, I don't need you or the Chum Bucket! I got plenty of friends around here who would love to take me in!
Plankton	Are you crazy? You're the most annoying sponge in the sea. I wouldn't stay with you if you were the last person in Bikini Bottom.
Plankton	Well, in that case, you're gonna need some new shoes.
Plankton	Threw me out? I threw her in!
Plankton	But I'm the best.
Plankton	Will you stop that?! There's no one behind you! You're the dimwit.
Plankton	After you.
Plankton	Uh...Patrick, you're not a total moron. Just half of one.
Plankton	Yeah, right! You two are mocking me!
Plankton	Forget it, SpongeBob. Karen's the perfect woman: so smart, so conniving! Ah, she's never gonna take me back.
Plankton	Of course I'm sure! Now, start doing a robot voice. Remember, you're not SpongeBob anymore; you're Shelby Naughtica.
Plankton	Don't you ruin this for me, SpongeBoob. Just eat it!
Plankton	1,000 what?!
Plankton	Eww, it's that fat screensaver again.
Plankton	Oof!
Plankton	Strike fear...
Plankton	Don't broadcast my secret plans! They're secret!  I will destroy all of you!
Plankton	Ow!  The fool! He left the safe open!
Plankton	Ha, that fool!
Plankton	Yoink!
Plankton	Oh, Karen, he covered me in urchins, fed me to a seahorse, and stung me to death! I fly through the air, he flies through the air! I hide in a stomach, he hides in a stomach! I have had enough!
Plankton	I'd like a room, please.
Plankton	Yes!  Yes!
Plankton	Krabs?! What are you doing in my hotel room?!
Plankton	That's right, Karen. By the time those two knuckleheads figure it out, I'll be knee-deep in secret formula.  Yes, I'll wear my galoshes. Gotta go.
Plankton	Hate! Hate!  Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate!
Plankton	Ahhhhh!
Plankton	(dancing, holding a microphone and singing to real tune) Deck the hall with fists of fury (punching at screen) Ha ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha. (wipes sweat off and hangs tongue)
Plankton	My evil genius video diary, by Sheldon J. Plankton.
Plankton	It's like I can't do anything right! She doesn't support me in any of my evil plans.
Plankton	Derrgg... Karen! You haven't heard the last of me!
Plankton	After all, everyone knows that an evil villain needs an exceptionally evil laugh. So, I've been working on a few new options. Ahem.
Plankton	Wow, that is annoying. Oh well, I guess I'll just keep practicing and we'll see who laughs last. Whoa!
Plankton	...bent on destroying The Krusty Krab and stealing the Krabby Patty formula...  I've got your formula.  Yeeha!  ...but I'm so much more than that. Does anyone care about my hopes? My dreams? My secret passion for song?  That's right. I may have a mind of an evil genius, but I also have the voice of an angel.   Me. Me. Me.  Me.
Plankton	Where you can enjoy a nice helping of chum.  Oh, boy this is so...  ...good.
Plankton	Relax, Eugene, there's nothing wrong as long as we use these inner-tubes!
Plankton	Actually, that's called standing, but close enough.
Plankton	Do the 'Loop Dee Loop.' Again. Again.  Zoom!
Plankton	Pickle?! I'm not a pickle, you...  Whoa! Careful, oaf!
Plankton	Um, I could use a little help here.  Well, at least I'm safe from those savages.  Err, gah. Ohhh!  Oh, mommy. Not the eye!
Plankton	Ouch!  And now for the final touch.  Perfect! With this disguise, that formula is as good as mine.
Plankton	Krabs!
Plankton	Oh, sweet domination. This is it!
Plankton	But we did everything you said-- I followed all the rules! I even ate 105 black licorice jellybeans through a straw!
Plankton	"Are you kidding me?!  That gigantic blowhard? ""Ooh, look at me! I've got a nose on the top of my head."" If anyone should be getting that prize, it's us.  Down here, weak-minded sponge!  If you're looking for the most important living creatures on the planet, well, here we are: plankton!"
Plankton	Oh, Karen, my computer wife, if only I could have managed to steal the secret to Krabs' success, the formula for the Krabby Patty. Then people would line up to eat at my restaurant. Lord knows I've tried. I've exhausted every evil plan in my filing cabinet...from A to Y.
Plankton	W, X, Y, Z. Plan Z! Here it is, just like you said.
Plankton	Not in something, , you twit!
Plankton	Time to put Plan Z into effect. Starting at the undersea castle of King Neptune.
Plankton	Ding-a-ling. Hey there, old buddy.  Freeze. [] One secret formula to go, please. No, no, don't trouble yourself. I'll get it. []Well, I'd like to hang around, but I've got Krabby Patties to make... over at the Chum Bucket. Plan Z, I love ya!
Plankton	"Well, Perch, before my dear friend Eugene Krabs was frozen by King Neptune...  I'm sorry. He confided in me a secret wish. ""Sell the Krabby Patty in my absence at the Chum Bucket,"" he said. ""Don't let the flame die out.""  By the way, act now and you get a free Chum Bucket bucket helmet with every purchase. Here you go, Perch."
Plankton	Evil Plan Z is working perfectly. Nothing can stop me now!
Plankton	And what's that supposed to mean?
Plankton	Who can stop me now?! Who?!
Plankton	SpongeBob, please! Let's talk about this.
Plankton	Potatoes?!
Plankton	You're welcome.
Plankton	Yes.  That's...that's...that's impossible!  Well, it  full of money just last week. Then I bought that airplane, and built that tank-
Plankton	Cyclops to Laptop. Come in, Laptop.
Plankton	Come on, SpongeBob!  JOIN ME!! AND WE'LL BE RICH AND POWERFUL! ...  ...until I eventually betray you!  Uuh... JOIN ME!!
Plankton	It's true!!
Plankton	Oh, boy. Who's there?
Plankton	Oh, make it stop, Krabs! MAKE IT STOP!!
Plankton	Oh, when will my frustration/humiliation end?
Plankton	You all look very hungry. Can I get anybody a Chumburger?
Plankton	No, stop, don't!
Plankton	What's a te-amwork?
Plankton	Tie 'em up.
Plankton	Time bomb... work.
Plankton	Isn't that your house?
Plankton	You got any other friends who aren't dim bulbs and nut jobs?
Plankton	Well, so much for your te-am.
Plankton	Yeah, yeah, too soon, huh?
Plankton	Good night, SpongeBob.
Plankton	So much sweetness! I think I'm gonna be sick.  Huh?
Plankton	Because uh... because uh... okay, fine, I was in your brain.
Plankton	Hey, don't take it personally, I just assume everyone is lying.
Plankton	You're not gonna start singing, are you?  Oh, brother.
Plankton	Slow down.
Plankton	Well, first we'll need a computer powerful enough to calculate the intricacies of time travel.
Plankton	Oh, come on, really?
Plankton	Okay. Wait a minute. No!
Plankton	Come on, SpongeBob, come on.
Plankton	Stop! Pull it over his head!
Plankton	Hey, baby, how are you?
Plankton	Sure. It's got everything we need. A photo booth, a cuckoo clock,  some day old chips. Now all we have to do is build it.  Oh, no, you don't.
Plankton	Wait. We  do it. As a te-am.
Plankton	"No, no, no, it's just one of the hazards of having a giant eyeball.  There's always stuff getting in there. Anyway,  where were we?  Say ""cheese."""
Plankton	"""Bubbles""?  Wha-what kind of a name is ""Bubbles""?"
Plankton	Okay, mine's moving.
Plankton	A team! All right, go get the formula.
Plankton	'Cause they don't make clothes in my size.
Plankton	Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get outta here.
Plankton	You grabbed the wrong bottle!
Plankton	I  selfish and evil until you ruined everything with your teamwork!
Plankton	I'll show  a happy ending.
Plankton	Oh, shrimp.
Plankton	You weak-minded fool!
Plankton	Oh, yeah get to the talking squirrel thing. This is not entertainment. Go back to the Krabby Patty!  Nobody listens to me.
Plankton	just like mom used to make.
Plankton	Boy, this story's keeping dumber and dumber, but i'm waiting for my wash cycle to end so I don't got anywhere to go. Nothing else on.
Plankton	Okay that's not funny at all, this guy is sick. This guy needs a doctor and no one is doing anything about it. Those germs he's spraying are gonna get all over me, I can feel it. Then I'll be sick.
Plankton	You tell him, octopus, he can't waste you're time like that! He's wasting my time, too.  Ugh, he snuck up on me there. Nice beard grandpa, why don't you tell me a bedtime story you old bottom-feeder?!
Plankton	Hahahahaha! Krabs' Cash Register goes bye-bye! Well, it's Sandy the do-gooder, doing good again. Oh, come on! She's gonna ruin everything. Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! This is exciting just like a parade!
Plankton	Way to tick. I may just get my destruction after all.  Nice Special Effects! If I saw that in a dark alley I'd be scared. Yeah, eat him, eat all of them!  It taste weird but it's good for you! Actually, it will be good for me. No more SpongeBob, No more of his laughter, , No more Squidward, No more Patrick, No more Krabs and no more worries. I could start a new career and sell insurance, like my dad. Then everyone will love me.
Plankton	Ouch.
Plankton	This is your greatest blunder, Krabs! For 15 years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up! I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula but I've got the next best thing: the guy who makes 'em!  I'm gonna run you out of business, Krabs.
Plankton	What is he doing? All these tears... and the showtunes... Why isn't he making the patties? Forget it. I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef.
Plankton	Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding.
Plankton	Say no more, I'll take care of everything.  How about here?
Plankton	Here?
Plankton	So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?
Plankton	And then the littlest sea-elf said...  Huh? Steady, Plankton! It's all gonna pay off soon enough. Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?
Plankton	But I don't understand.  You have the grill, and the spatula, and the comfy chair.  I rubbed your putrid feet!
Plankton	What!?  That's it, mister! You just lost your brain privileges.  Finished! SpongeBob, come in here! Or should I say RobotBob Sponge...Chef...Pants...  I put the brain in the robot, you know. You shouldn't have been a spoiled brat. You see, I always get what I want, and I want you to make me a Krabby Patty!
Plankton	I can't take anymore. You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back! It's not worth it. I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square.
Plankton	Thank you!  Ouch.
Plankton	Psst... young man.  Yes, over here. Come on boy, a little closer.  Closer...  Not that close!  You blasted barnacle head! I mean... hi.
Plankton	Well, we're both invertebrates, aren't we?
Plankton	Booster seat? Hot dog! I mean, no. What I want for my birthday from you my friend, is one of those  tender... delicious... Krabby Patties!
Plankton	SpongeBob, you will be mine!
Plankton	Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player.
Plankton	Toot toot! How about a little take-out?
Plankton	No, no, no, no.  There, you see how much easier it is when you help, friend? How do you like my analyzer? It tells the ingredients of whatever I put into it.
Plankton	Steamy...
Plankton	SpongeBob, that's my Krabby Patty!  Give it back, you porous freak! I command you! My patty!  Nooooo! I'll settle for some fries.
Plankton	It's tremendous, you wanna see?
Plankton	Pew! He's right.
Plankton	Good. Because today, the Chum Bucket is going to kick...
Plankton	Ladies and gentlemen, turn your attention to the southwest corridor!
Plankton	Representing the Chum Bucket, a creature so fearsome, so terrible, so mind-bendingly large, that those of you with weak constitutions may want to leave the stadium.
Plankton	...Patrick Star!
Plankton	Of course he would. Just look at him. Square: the shape of evil!
Plankton	That...
Plankton	Better than you!
Plankton	Get back here and kill each other!
Plankton	Curse you, Mr. Krabs!  Ouch!
Plankton	What a brilliant idea! Your parents must have been like, part computer or something.  Now, let's see here.  No...  no...  no...  A-ha!  Well, I hate to leave you, Karen, but you know what they say... a rolling stone gathers no algae!  Ahh...  Ugh... dear Neptune above, what happened last night? Huh, what's this?  Mister Plankton?  Who the Davey?  Ehh... I'm in the Krusty Krab... and that means the life switcher was a success! The Krusty Krab is mine!  Corporate casual!
Plankton	I'm gonna need to take one of these Patties back to my office for um, bun inspection.
Plankton	Uhh... yes, uh, very nice. Um, thanks.  All mine, it's finally all mine! The Patties...  The wealth...  The notoriety! The...  SpongeBob, what do you want?
Plankton	Eh, you're doing fine. Now leave me to my work.
Plankton	The sauce. I don't know. You're using too much sauce, okay? Review's over.
Plankton	What do you want from me, a promotion?
Plankton	So, have you two known each other long?  Huh?
Plankton	Now, no more intrusions! I'd like the begin writing the memoirs of my success story, so everyone just stay the
Plankton	Ow!
Plankton	What? It's just an ordinary Krabby  Oh, my goodness! Squidward!
Plankton	Make it stop!  What, did I say the secret word?
Plankton	What? Who? Where? Somebody tell me.
Plankton	Good grief, he's naked!
Plankton	Well, it's great to be back!  Huh?
Plankton	Well, I'd like to take you up on your offer to make the Chum Bucket a success!
Plankton	You're making chum pudding?
Plankton	A star.
Plankton	Isn't it obvious?
Plankton	Yes! You can run but,you can't hide SquarePants! How do you like that huh? Take that!
Plankton	Well, at least I still have the pickle. Well, this stinks.
Sandy	Wow! I didn't think super powers worked that way.
Sandy	Five!
Sandy	THAT'S FOR YESTERDAY, SQUAREPANTS!
Sandy	SpongeBob! Land on your bottom! It'll cushion the impact of the fall!
Sandy	Yeah. Ride 'em, cowboy!  Hey, SpongeBob!
Sandy	That's crazy talk!
Sandy	What about eating?
Sandy	Look at all the jellyfish out here! Too bad SpongeBob's missing out on all the fun!
Sandy	That is it, SquarePants! We're gonna find you something that's so dang fun that you'll have to come outside!
Sandy	Ferris wheel!
Sandy	Nothing's working, Pat!
Sandy	All right, SpongeBob. You win. Stay inside forever. Yours is truly the iron will. Now, Pat!  Eek! A gorilla! Save me, SpongeBob!
Sandy	If you're Patrick, then who is that?
Sandy	Huh?  Well, that's funny, I thought I heard voices. Huh?  I thought I left that glass of peanut juice on the table.  And didn't I toss that old lamp out yesterday? And since when did I acquire all these portraits of Patrick?
Sandy	What has four wheels and flies? A garbage truck!
Sandy	Science makes everything sound painful, SpongeBob.  Now, here's a humor theory textbook, laugh mechanics, and the quantum giggle theory.
Sandy	Howdy.
Sandy	Did somebody say boom?
Sandy	Just where you think it would be.
Sandy	What's going on with this thing?  What in tarnation?
Sandy	Well, here goes nothing.
Sandy	Say hello to the 'Molecular Separator Ray'.
Sandy	Well, uhh, I suppose... I'll have it ready before you go on.
Sandy	No, Squidward! That's a very sensitive device!
Sandy	It lets you talk to nuts. What use is that?
Sandy	So long, Bikini Bottom, I can't leave without a good-bye. But please don't think bad of me, if'n I start to cry. So long, Bikini Bottom, there's so many things I'll miss, from your smoggy, crowded city, to your stingin' jellyfish. This town is filled with many things, that I've come to love. From the birds that fly upon the ground, to the flowers up above. Farewell, Bikini Bottom, now I really hate to go. 'Cause the things I'll miss the most of all, are the friends I've come to know.
Sandy	SpongeBob! What the heck is going on here?!
Sandy	Yeah.
Sandy	Howdy, SpongeBob.
Sandy	There's something rotten in the Alamo. I'd better tag along and see if it's on the up-and-up.
Sandy	Howdy, Master Udon, I'm Sandy Cheeks. I do a little karate, myself.
Sandy	Something smells like rancid rodeo around here.
Sandy	Heck, I could karate you in a country fiddle with one paw tied behind my back.
Sandy	"SpongeBob's in trouble!  SpongeBob is the ""King of Karate"". He doesn't need me. Eh, he can handle this himself."
Sandy	Huh?
Sandy	All right, who's next?
Sandy	Ha-ha, Phil! Your foul stench can't permeate my fresh-air dome.
Sandy	You mean this whole thing was a scam to get us to buy real estate?
Sandy	Aw, shucks, SpongeBob, that's what friends are for.
Sandy	There's a full moon out tonight. Do you like my new telescope I wished for?
Sandy	Wig's... uh great...SpongeBob.
Sandy	Well, it does attract a lot of attention.
Sandy	Well, they can't. Look, your stupid wig is blocking the whole screen.
Sandy	Hurry up, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Well, there's nothing to do for it, but surgery.
Sandy	Oh, Squidward, always wanting to do it the hard way  We're all set, Squidward! Are you ready for the sedative?
Sandy	Patrick! SpongeBob!
Sandy	You better calm down, Squidward. With them little critters inside you, I wouldn't be moving around too much. You could knock them into something important.
Sandy	You're trespassing, SpongeBob -- in my lab, in my submarine -- and you're trespassing  inside of Squidward.
Sandy	This is approximately 17 times harder to drive than a boat mobile, which you've never successfully done.  So, just take it nice and easy.
Sandy	Squidward!
Sandy	They've gone off course!  Oh my gosh! You're out of control!
Sandy	Wait a minute, Squidward. He might be on to something.
Sandy	We're going through with your plan, Patrick!
Sandy	Okay, you're going to have to go out and dislodge it somehow.
Sandy	I can't right now, SpongeBob. I got a leak in my roof the size of a full-grown quarter horse!
Sandy	I know, but you saved the treedome! Pretty cool, if you ask me.
Sandy	Oh my gosh. How long you've been stuck there, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Oh, come on now, there's got to be a way.  I've got an idea.  Hang on tight, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Howdy, SpongeBob, how do you like it?
Sandy	No way, SpongeBob. Especially after your little mishap with my whirlybird.  Besides, there's not enough room for you.
Sandy	That's the air vent, SpongeBob.  I need that, too.
Sandy	Aww, hush, silly.  This is for harvesting moon rocks.
Sandy	Oh, SpongeBob...
Sandy	Aliens? Is that what this is about?  This isn't the moon! We're still in Bikini Bot--
Sandy	Well, I know you need a lot of crazy gadgets like jet-packs and laser-equipped Bermuda shorts with walkie-talkies.
Sandy	Whoops, wrong outfit.
Sandy	Wow!
Sandy	Wow, guys. You two, uh...  Really know how to, uh..  Throw a party.
Sandy	I'm fine! My skin just hasn't adjusted to this here underwater air.
Sandy	Rashy sore. I mean, sure.
Sandy	No, but you can use this one right quick.
Sandy	Aah! Gimmie that!  Phew!
Sandy	Tarnation! They're multiplyin' like mad!  Run!
Sandy	Back off!
Sandy	I do not play games.  Quick! In the tree house. It's the only safe place left.  We should be protected here.  Hold on!
Sandy	SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They're cold and mean and none too bright.
Sandy	And science, don't forget science. Whats all the hubba boys?
Sandy	Did you all hear something? I can hardly believe that there's a lost city where having smarts is more important-than being pretty!  With all their advanced science, and my painfully large mind!
Sandy	What else can it turn things into?
Sandy	Y'all head out without me.
Sandy	Don't just stand there! Move!
Sandy	Hang in there, little buddy!
Sandy	Can't we stay?
Sandy	Whoa!  Hot cat snake in a barn. Look at your eye. Land sakes. That's quite a shiner you got there. Well, don't you worry none. I know some natural remedies that'll...
Sandy	Well, what type of man scuffles boots with you and loses?
Sandy	Well, looks like you're late for your day job, killer.
Sandy	This little guy? Why, it's just a harmless little cricket, he's a land creature just like me! The poor thing must have gotten lost. Oh, he's not going to hurt ya. See?
Sandy	This is ain't 'ordinary camping trip, I go out into the wild armed only with my bare hands, my quick wits, this harpoon, and 65 pounds of dynamite . Out in the wild, it's eat or be eaten. You have to be willing to do anything when you're alone in the wild. You two wouldn't last a single day!
Sandy	I'm  Sandy Cheeks! Survivalist extraordinaire!
Sandy	Guys? What'cha doing? Aah, fellas?
Sandy	Something wrong, SpongeBob? You look sadder than a bullfrog full of sody-pop.
Sandy	That's not the kind of famous I mean. Come on. Lets do a little digging around your family tree.
Sandy	Says here he saved the entire town of Dead Eye Gulch, that's what Bikini Bottom was known as back in the old west days.  It was a town that lived under the tyranny of a nasty crook 'til a mysterious stranger came to town.
Sandy	Gross! Don't touch that, SpongeBob! Eeew! What are you doing?!  That boy ain't hooked up right.
Sandy	Keep dreaming, SpongeBob. Keep dreaming.
Sandy	Oh, you gave me a surprise, alright. Look at the surprise I got!  Get out of here! Idiot Boy!
Sandy	Gary? Where are you, little guy?
Sandy	A note.  To whom it may concern: if you found this letter, that means Gary's food bowl is empty and that it needs to be refilled. It also means it's been approximately one year since I've split town, and no one's noticed 'til now. No one needs to worry, I won't bother anyone again. Sincerely, SpongeBob. A.K.A. Idiot Boy.
Sandy	I should have never kicked you out of my house!
Sandy	You got it, SquidCakes, but it's gonna take all of us to find--
Sandy	SpongeBob!  Maybe someone at that truck stop has seen our porous little buddy.
Sandy	Uh, Pat? All the ink came off on your belly.
Sandy	Hang on a minute. I don't mean to put a damper on the mood here but Bikini Bottom needs you back, SpongeBob.
Sandy	It's me, Sandy. Don't pretend you don't remember me, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Squidward?
Sandy	SpongeBob's back!
Sandy	Why, sure! Glad to meet you, partner.
Sandy	Hiya Pat.
Sandy	I was just storing food for the impending winter. Want one?
Sandy	SpongeBob, next time before you run around accusing people of things, make sure your own house is in order first!
Sandy	: Not to mention the fact that he's written lies about us!
Sandy	-eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-haw! I love the beach!
Sandy	Locals only!
Sandy	Well, Sandy, using only your bare hands and the resources found on this deserted island, you have not only survived, but thrived. You've built a five star hotel, a steam-powered generator, a car that runs on coconut milk, and even a espresso bar. I almost don't wanna leave. But I miss Bikini Bottom. Now I can find SpongeBob and the gang and fly us right back.  Acorn 1 to Tower. Request clearance.
Sandy	I'm not a spaceman, you dunder-head! It's me, Sandy! SpongeBob's friend.
Sandy	You some kinda mind-reader?
Sandy	Uhh, I don't wanna disappoint you, SpongeBob but you won't see any progress with those.
Sandy	Be at my place at 5 a.m. Oh! And you'll need a water helmet.  Come on, SpongeBob, it's only push-ups! Come on. Come on! You can do it!
Sandy	Well, now that we've got warmed up, it's time for the arm-cruncher.
Sandy	Uhh, whatever. Thanks.
Sandy	Heck, what's your secret?
Sandy	Can't argue with those results. What you need to do now is put those muscles to the test.
Sandy	C'mon, let's go.
Sandy	Ok...
Sandy	Ready, SpongeBob?
Sandy	I want 100 more.
Sandy	Sure you can't stay for just a short spell, SpongeBob? I mean, it's such a nice day, everyone's having a good time.
Sandy	Nice job, SpongeBob! Your serve!
Sandy	Hey, SpongeBob. How's it going?
Sandy	You're not gonna forget, are ya?
Sandy	Just finishin up here!
Sandy	And the birthday cake?  Greetings, my distinguished colleagues! Tonight, you will witness an invention so revolutionary, it may change modern science forever! Now to demonstrate, my assistant will disrobe and enter the machine.
Sandy	I apologize for the delay. Now lets continue the demonstration. I give you, the Protogenerator 2000!  This device gives a single laborer the productivity of 5, 6, 7, up to 8 workers...  ...which is great for the management, but is also a boom for the workers because they'll always get high marks on their employee report card!
Sandy	That looks like my power drill! You've got a lot of explaining to do, mister!  You ate that leg of ham yesterday! You wrote this originally to go with this show, Daniel sir!
Sandy	As you can see, I've made 2 clones of my subject which will allow him to honor all of the commitments he's made this evening.  You hear that, SpongeBob? You can be in three places at once now!
Sandy	Whee, doggy! I can line-dance better than that!  Yee-haw!
Sandy	Time to get this stinky thing off!
Sandy	...A-doop-doop-doo, a-doop-doop-doo, scrub scrub scrub in the tub tub tub...
Sandy	Aaaaaahhh! Now it's time to out my stinky fur coat!
Sandy	I'm locked in!
Sandy	You! You seen anybody in these parts haulin' a fur pelt?
Sandy	Time to go catch me some skunk!
Sandy	It's not my fault! I...
Sandy	My pelt!
Sandy	Hi-ya!
Sandy	Uh, sure, Mr. Krabs.
Sandy	What in tarnation's going on with you two?
Sandy	Why, I'm a pet goldfish in a bowl!
Sandy	Hi-yah! Trying to ninja sneak attack? Hi-yah! Hi-yah!  Well, youre still no match for my squirrel-fu!  Its a letter from my twin brother, Randy!
Sandy	You got cotton in your ears?
Sandy	No. Its my rodeo championship on the line.
Sandy	Rodeo
Sandy	Rodeo!
Sandy	Rodeo!
Sandy	Yee-haw!
Sandy	I dont need to be saved!  Watch out! That old bullfrogs got a flea on his flanks, and hes comin right at ya!
Sandy	Howdy, little buddy! I need your help with an experiment!
Sandy	Howdy, SpongeBob! You're right on time to help me test out my new disappearator. It'll make anything disappear instantly. Now hold still and I'll just shave a few inches off the top of your noggin.
Sandy	Aw, SpongeBob, don't go trying to be someone you're not. You are who you are, and who you are is just fine!
Sandy	All done!
Sandy	We gotta help him quick. He could be in great danger.
Sandy	Get him!
Sandy	I'll be darned if anyone can resist a Western song while wearing a Western hat. Come here, you! Oh, life on the prairie is lonesome indeed. Not a friend in sight among the rustling weeds. So, when I get lonesome, I don't have a conniption, I just fire up my friend, Generator Contraption!  That only seems to have made him madder. We need somebody with really musical talent to get rid of this thing.
Sandy	Yes  SpongeBob? What are you doing with that magnifying glass?
Sandy	I keep this thing here for emergencies. This is an emergency. Right SpongeBob?
Sandy	How can I be sure you're not whelks in disguise?
Sandy	You're in.  I think I have the answer! Now, do ya want the regular answer, or the ACTION PACKED answer?!
Sandy	Come on, guys! Follow me!
Sandy	Well, golly! No wonder they're all grumpy! Them whelks are full of germs! They're sicker than a bull with the squirrel pox!
Sandy	Hi-yah! Yah.
Sandy	I don't think so.
Sandy	Hi-yah!
Sandy	I'm not falling for it, SpongeBob!
Sandy	Aww, shoot, SpongeBob. I guess you ain't fibbing.  Aww, that game was getting old anyway. It's not fun anymore. I mean, what's so fun about  this?
Sandy	Wanna go to the park?
Sandy	Ha! I don't even know what that is.
Sandy	Uhh, mustard. Mustard! I want mustard on my sandwich.  There we go.
Sandy	Ohh, uhh, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Do you think, umm do you think I could cut this one?
Sandy	10! Yes, 10! Because we're really hungry!
Sandy	How about some tomatoes?
Sandy	You're mince meat!
Sandy	Huh?
Sandy	It worked! Hooray!
Sandy	You were able to convert yourself into gaseous form? Facinatin'!
Sandy	And how!
Sandy	Wowee! Is that a real mark-3 surplus wifeomatic? She is beautiful.
Sandy	Why, you have the most important job of all! You'll be our test monkey.
Sandy	Oh, well.  Try again.
Sandy	Hm. Now only his mouth is missing.
Sandy	Why, sure enough! Three!
Sandy	Not exactly, Lab Partner.
Sandy	Hold on there, little square dude!
Sandy	I like you, SpongeBob. Why, we could be tighter than bark on a tree. Hi-yah!
Sandy	No kidding?
Sandy	Hold on a sec, I'll let you in.
Sandy	Well, all right. I made Texas tea and cookies. Well, come on in! Hi-yah!  That's not in. In!  You're a funny little dude. Come on, I'll give you the grand tour.  This is my own private little air bubble. This air is the driest...  ...purest...  ...most airiest air in the whole sea. Oh, over there's my birdbath.  And that's my oak tree.  It provides me with extra air. This dome is made of the finest polyurethane, that's a fancy word for plastic. Ain't that just the bees knees? Tell you what, weren't easy getting here neither. First, I...  ...that's my treadmill. That's how I stay in tip-top shape. Well, come on. Lets have that tea now.
Sandy	Can I get you anything?
Sandy	Why, these flowers are just beautiful!  They'll last much, much longer in a vase full of ice, cold water.  So tell me about yourself.  It must be fascinating being a sea critter.  SpongeBob?  Oh, there's the cookies.  Be right back.
Sandy	Hey SpongeBob, what brings you here?
Sandy	Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute!
Sandy	Do us all a favor, SpongeBob, and stay out of our dreams!
Sandy	[shivering] Th-th-th-th-th-thanks, guys.
Sandy	I'd hate to break up story time, but I'd like to NOT GET EATEN today!
Sandy	What's the big emergency, Patrick?
Sandy	A citylacra!
Sandy	Look out!
Sandy	Gotcha!
Sandy	We must be heading in the right direction!
Sandy	Just leave that to the scientist of the group!
Sandy	That may be true Plankton but you've got seven angry customers flanking you on all sides.
Sandy	It has been scientifically proven that  85% of speech related stress can be eliminated if the speaker imagines the audience in their underwear.
Sandy	Mayday! Mayday!
Sandy	Those two agents from the Zero Dryland Security just confiscated all my vacation slides, boys. Or so they think...  You see,  Someone already made six copies.
Sandy	Okay, no more questions until the end of the slideshow. Okay?  Good.  The first slide is of me getting some last-minute readings before I took off on my vacation.  And this is me giving the thumbs-up-goodbye for now salute.  And this...  is where a little square pal of mine decided to pay me a visit.
Sandy	The moon!
Sandy	SpongeBob? What in cold chicken and pickles are you doing in my ship?
Sandy	for the afterburners!  What were you saying, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Only if it gets sucked into the reverse spatial linearity drive.  Ah nuts!
Sandy	Just don't touch anything while we separate.
Sandy	Oh, come on SpongeBob. You got this! It's a can of corn.
Sandy	"You did great, SpongeBob! But, you should call your trick the ""no-look, one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up, puncture the fuel tank on the rocket."
Sandy	Only if you consider being consumed in a giant fireball bad.
Sandy	Yeehaw! Yeehaw!!!
Sandy	Oh, sure, SpongeBob. I'll be there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot greasy griddle in the middle of August in...
Sandy	Well, I'm coming over to take a look. I'll be over there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot...
Sandy	Ok, now tell me,  since when do you have two houses?
Sandy	See? He's even worse than I thought.
Sandy	SpongeBob, you'll be better soon.
Sandy	Huh?
Sandy	Nope, none in there!
Sandy	Oh, you'll be laughing out the other side of your tombstone once you've had a taste of my ghost-catcher!
Sandy	The Dutchman's gaining on us!
Sandy	Funny, y'all should ask that.
Sandy	Eureka, it worked! The experiment is a success.
Sandy	SPOOOOONGEBOOOOOOOOOOOOOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sandy	I'll tar and feather you nincompoops later. My suit's air supply is nearing empty. Luckily, I have just enough air in my submarine to get to the surface and refill my air tanks.
Sandy	Are there cobwebs on my face? 'Cause it feels like there's cobwebs on my face.
Sandy	Hang on, fellers! I got a hankering for a Krabby Patty
Sandy	Hm-mmm.
Sandy	That's my friend: SpongeBob SquarePants
Sandy	What Fuzzy is trying to say is that he is here to judge whether anyone is worthy of getting a karate belt or not.
Sandy	Okay, SpongeBob! You gotta catch me first!
Sandy	Hey! You can't do that!
Sandy	That's it! I'll take him to the Krusty Krab and then he might just find himself impressed by a certain sandwich maker!
Sandy	Well, that took some agility!
Sandy	Told ya!
Sandy	Oh no!
Sandy	Sure, lets get you fitted with a helmet.
Sandy	Or my artificial intelligence that comes in the form of a multi-colored cubeshaped puzzle. See it can solve itself.
Sandy	Happy Valentine's Day, SpongeBob. I'm nuts for you.
Sandy	I got a visual on the carnival. You want me to bring her in?
Sandy	Hing-ya! Take him up to the Ferris wheel and I'll meet you there! Sandy out!
Sandy	Howdy, Patrick!
Sandy	If only we knew the Jellien's weakness.
Sandy	Not to worry!  We'll be in disguise.
Sandy	SpongeBob! The mayonnaise!
Sandy	Hold it right there you evil blob of slime! You're through 'cause we know your weakness! Show 'em SpongeBob!
Sandy	Then I'll just turn up the heat!
Sandy	Oh, you know. A little of this, a little of that, A little vacuuming...
Sandy	This place sure went to pot, quick. Knockity knock, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Perfectly calibrated!  OW!
Sandy	First thing you gotta do is clean out all this old junk.
Sandy	About these columns? Nice, huh? Gives the pineapple an intellectual flavor.
Sandy	Fantastic?
Sandy	: You two need help.
Sandy	: You seem to be carrying a lot of stress in your eyeballs. Them shoulders look way outta line. Fell them nights just meltin away. Let's see if i can just get that jaw line back in place. Phew! OK you two bad news first. That wicked Face Freeze ain't going nowhere. But, y'all are looking much more relaxed.
Sandy	Why should I help all them jerks?
Sandy	The fruitcake is contaminated with jerktonium! No wonder I've been as ornery as a sidewinder on a hot driveway. Jerktonium is the orneriest element of them all and your fruitcake is full of it. Where'd you get that fruitcake, anyway?
Sandy	No wonder everyone in town is a big old meanie.
Sandy	Heck no. I was breaking a record for rooting around in a trash bin. It's all right here in The Guinness O' Ripley Enormous Book Of Curiosities, Oddities, and World Records.  Look-e here, SpongeBob. Staring Record. 5 days. Most fries up nose. Holding your breath.
Sandy	Well, that's easy.  106, 107...
Sandy	Is it dangerous?
Sandy	Raw.
Sandy	What?! SpongeBob! I need photographic proof of my amazing deeds!
Sandy	Great! Take a picture of me chucking this last woodchuck to break the woodchuck chuckin' world record. Ready Cousin Earl?
Sandy	Thank you.  So, what's next? Oh yeah, longest tooth. So hows the calcium fusion going?
Sandy	Thank you. Next, spiciest chili gargle.
Sandy	Cheese!
Sandy	Ok, shoot!
Sandy	Why that's easy I just stop and run like heck!  Not that way!  Come on, SpongeBob! Pull yourself together! We still got a ton of records to break! Oh yeah! You're gonna love this one!
Sandy	Nah, let's get a shot from the top!
Sandy	OK shut her down!
Sandy	SpongeBob, what are you doing?
Sandy	I don't know SpongeBob. With the rubbery arms and doeyness in this areawe obviously-
Sandy	"""I promise not to use karate only for protection and not for revenge."""
Sandy	Arms up Squidward! Block! BLOCK!Block! BLOCK!
Sandy	Vengeance? Squidward Tentacles, I told ya at the beginning that karate ain't for revenge! Sorry Squidward. As of now, I ain't your sensei no more!
Sandy	Wow! It looks great!
Sandy	It wasn't! But today is chore day! So I'd figured why not fry two fish in one skillet!
Sandy	Gosh! What happened to you?
Sandy	Stop!  Those bubbles are dangerous!
Sandy	That's what they said about microwave ovens, dry cleaning, and corn dogs!
Sandy	See, I told ya!  Run for your lives!
Sandy	No, Patrick, don't! That thing's volatile! There's no telling what kind of damage it'll cause if it pops!
Sandy	Well, it seems to have stabilized. As long as it doesn't get any bigger, there's not too much to worry about.  That ain't good.
Sandy	We need to get to my submarine! Fast!  Squidward, it's an emergency! I'm gonna need your bike!  Hop on, SpongeBob!
Sandy	I was afraid it might come to this. In order to save the city, we must destroy public property.
Sandy	What are y'all up to this time?
Sandy	When we get you out of there, you've got some explaining to do!
Sandy	Plankton, you creepy bacteria! Give me back my sub!  My sub!
Sandy	Well, I don't see what you're so gull darn happy about! This is a catastrophe!
Sandy	Cat?!  In what way am I kind oflike a cat?
Sandy	Hiya, Kenny. Mind if I get your signature? Gee, it sure is nice to meet another air-breathing, warm-blooded varmit down here.
Sandy	What has gotten into you, SpongeBob? Can't I talk about what must surely be happening from a biological standpoint? I mean, like the lack of oxygen will heighten the capillaries in the lungs, causing a dangerous level of carbon monoxide to rise in the bloodstream, which in turn leads to a ghostly blue color to the skin, followed by eventual unconsciousness.
Sandy	Don't lose your barnacles boys. Hi-yah!  There it is!
Sandy	You know, all of a sudden, I don't feel like sand castles, SpongeBob. I'll see y'all later.
Sandy	Listen, SpongeBob. Right now, I don't want to build sand castles, play karate, or eat jellyfish.
Sandy	Heck gum it, SpongeBob, what is it?
Sandy	I wanna wake up in Texas.  I miss those wide open skies. I miss my 20 acres, barbecues and pecan pies, oh, why? When I'm so far from you Texas, all I can do is cry.  I wanna go hoooommme.  I wanna go home.
Sandy	It's time for this tumbleweed to tumble on home.
Sandy	What did you say?
Sandy	No! You can't say nothing about Texas!
Sandy	Y'all best apologize, or I'll be on you like ugly on an ape!
Sandy	Wha-what's this?
Sandy	Huh, duh. What am I doing? I was home all along, and it took me until now to realize it.
Sandy	Okay, let's begin the experiment.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, next.
Sandy	Heck if I know.  this here's a psychological test to see how much weird gunk folks will eat... if it's free.  Who's for seconds?
Sandy	Remember, your landmarks!
Sandy	Well, I'm excited! We're gonna be the first people to test out Patrick's game!
Sandy	Hmm... Coral Avenue. I'll buy it!
Sandy	Got it.
Sandy	Now, that's a silly face!
Sandy	Wow, that sounds pretty grown up, SpongeRobert!
Sandy	It's here! Yee-Haw! My newest science book has arrived! I wonder what new and fantastic area of science will be revealed to me this month!  Oh, hey! It's those fancy bloomers I ordered too! This day keeps getting better!  Ahh! Behavorial psychology is the study of people and their habits. I studied underwater chemistry, geology, and astronomy, but I never studied underwater people!
Sandy	Subject asked to be excused, but I am unable to observe what she wishes to be excused from.
Sandy	Who won't mind being observed.
Sandy	No, Patrick. It's an experiment in behavioral psychology.
Sandy	Aww. Alright. Experiment's done.
Sandy	Oh, forget it.
Sandy	Hey! Are you guys up for another experiment?
Sandy	Eew.
Sandy	Good job, fellers!
Sandy	All systems check.
Sandy	Hey, boys! How'd ya like a nice free bowl of tootsie frootsie ice cream?
Sandy	Time for variable two. More free ice cream here! Now, with the same size cones!
Sandy	Jeepers! I didn't see that comin'!
Sandy	Open the door! The experiment is over!  Open the door!
Sandy	I didn't care about the sand! I just wanted to observe you acting naturally. So, I hid microphones and cameras around your house...
Sandy	Now, let the real experiment begin.
Sandy	Spongebob, don't you think that you may be using the thumbs-up just a teensy bit too much?
Sandy	SpongeBob! It's me, Sandy!  Hey SpongeBob! I haven't seen you in days, whatcha doin'?
Sandy	I don't know SpongeBob! That's a question you have to answer for yourself.
Sandy	Hey!
Sandy	Hiyah, hiyah! Hiyah!
Sandy	Jumpin' beans on a trampoline! You're starvin'! I got to make you the best fertilizer known to critter-kind!
Sandy	Hey there, SpongeBob? Could you swing by my place?
Sandy	So some Shalmon guy told you people would want to eat my nuts and you believe it?
Sandy	Patrick, that Nutty Butter is for eating.
Sandy	There. Everything is back to normal.  What in tarnation?
Sandy	Aw, gosh Patrick. I don't have enough to feed everyone.
Sandy	In fact, demands have been so high, I scienced up a way to increase my production.
Sandy	We're gonna need a lot more acorns to feed them all.
Sandy	You used all the nuts? Jumpin' Jiminy! Time for another dose of fertilizer!
Sandy	Thanks, Shammy. But I'm a one tree kind of squirrel. I'm gonna do what I should've done in the first place. Order the ole' girl some nutritious new dirt from Texas!
Sandy	Relax, SpongeBob. You're twitchin' like a prairie dog on a cow-skin rug.
Sandy	Well, it ain't no lie if you actually learn how to fly. And I can help you with that!
Sandy	Failed. Alright, let's try that again! SpongeBob? Hmm?
Sandy	Hmm. Good enough.
Sandy	Get ready, boys! The bronco is loose! I repeat, the bronco is loose!
Sandy	I never thought that folks around here were particularly bright. But this morning everyone seems as dumb as traffic cones.
Sandy	Hey, Patrick. Have you noticed that everyone's acting a lot like you today?
Sandy	Lining up for the Chum Bucket? Now, I know everyone's got a hole in their screen door. This place is ground zero for zero.
Sandy	Bright.
Sandy	Wise up!
Sandy	Come one, come all to Bikini Bottom University! A free education for all! There's no more excuse for being a dope! Step right up all you morons! Classes are now beginning!
Sandy	A whole school full of Patricks? Looks like we've got our work cut out for us.
Sandy	This is a proud day for everyone in Bikini Bottom! And as a treat, Squidward will play Pomp and Circumstance on the clarinet.
Sandy	Dang. You two sure are lucky that I created this brain detector last summer. I was beginning to think I'd never use this thing.
Sandy	We're gonna take that as a yes. Step lively, fellas!
Sandy	Sorry nothin'! Look, Old Timer, one false move and I'll be on you like a horsefly on a cracker barrel!
Sandy	Well, I think we've got a cure for what ails you. Right, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Plankton, maybe we should play a game that's a little less dangerous. You're flatter than hammered horse hockey.
Sandy	Ah!
Sandy	Right guys, that's... almost... the spirit.
Sandy	You can do it, SpongeBob, just concentrate, and it'll all come back to ya!
Sandy	I know you're in there somewhere, SquarePants!
Sandy	I'm a square and yellow critter!
Sandy	"Hello?  What in tarnation?  ""To Sandy, the smartest, prettiest squirrel in Bikini Bottom. Signed, a Friend"".  I wonder who it could be from."
Sandy	Okay, how about you, Patrick?  Uhh, Patrick? O...kay. How about you, Mr. Krabs?  Squidward?  Ah, nuts.
Sandy	This is much more fun with SpongeBob.
Sandy	Ancient ruins, not rains.
Sandy	Up is that way?
Sandy	Looks like some sort of control module or maybe a holographic projector.  Whoops! Well, I guess we're gonna find out what this doohickey does.
Sandy	Woah, what is this place?
Sandy	SpongeBob!
Sandy	Y'all watch this!  Way to go, Larry!
Sandy	You okay, SpongeBob?
Sandy	SpongeBob!
Sandy	No, just a cup's worth.  This here's my cricket.  He's saying hello to you. Ain't he cute?
Sandy	Oh, that's only Wormy. He don't eat much.
Sandy	I paid $10!
Sandy	Oh! Hey, Patrick!
Sandy	Have you looked outside? Does that seem okay to you? I'm trying to figure out what happened to society. If we don't fix it soon, there won't be anything left to fix!
Sandy	I just don't know how we're going to appease them!
Sandy	Ah, fresh air. Oh, how I've missed you.
Sandy	If you ate all that, you'd have enough energy to run around the whole world.
Sandy	I'm hotter than a hickory-smoked sausage!
Sandy	Cowabunga!
Sandy	I told ya, SpongeBob...  I'm hibernating next week.
Sandy	Enough chitter-chatter, SpongeBob. We don't have much time left!
Sandy	We gotta jump off of stuff!
Sandy	I can't burn carbs in my sleep!
Sandy	I'm hotter than a hickory-smoked sausage! Woo-hoo!
Sandy	I'll be asleep all winter! We only got three days for fun.  Well hurry now! The giant clams like to feed at this hour!  Isn't this great?
Sandy	I did, SpongeBob, the industrial park!  This is where the real action is!  This part gets pretty technical! Yee-haw! Now for the speed course. Hold on!  I hope we make it!  I'm havin' fun, too!  Wake up, slowpoke.  We're going fly-fishing.
Sandy	Well I'm going to look over here.
Sandy	Alpha Team, you search uptown. Gold Team searches downtown. Any questions?
Sandy	Status report!
Sandy	Well, think again!  Attention Bikini Bottom, the time has come to double, no, triple our efforts!
Sandy	That ain't SpongeBob! SpongeBob is square!
Sandy	He's not...huh?  They must have gone to search some more.  SpongeBob, where are you?!  You under there?  Nope.
Sandy	There's no time to wait! Hibernation!
Sandy	No. I can't believe you haven't heard of...  ...Christmas.
Sandy	I'm gonna catch you and throw you in jail at taxpayers' expense.
Sandy	Gonna skin y'all and make a pair of size six...boots...
Sandy	Okay, Pinhead Larry, now you get yours!  Pinhead!  Now you're gonna pay for those crimes, Pinhead!
Sandy	I sure can't wait to go outside and warm my fur!
Sandy	[] SpongeBob... Patrick...
Sandy	Go get 'em, SpongeBob!
Sandy	Howdy, SpongeBob.
Sandy	You're right, SpongeBob. I was being a little too sensitive.  No hard feelings.  Okay, deodorant. Huh, let's see. Roll-on or stick?
Sandy	Stupidity isn't a virus, but it sure is spreading like it.
Sandy	SpongeBob, this is serious. Since you've been telling them jokes, people have been treating me different.
Sandy	Thanks SpongeBob, I knew you'd understand.
Sandy	You were right SpongeBob! Those jokes are funny! Come on over to the Treedome tomorrow and celebrate, Sandy.
Sandy	Naw,  I just done put glue on it so you wouldn't fall off.  Are them flowers for me? You even done got me a vase!
Sandy	Oh wait, don't tell me. I know this one!
Sandy	Dumb, dumb, dumb, squirrels is dumb.
Sandy	Yeah. Relax.
Sandy	You know, normally, I'd offer to race you to the top of coral cliffs. But I don't want to miss out on a second of this beautiful beauty.
Sandy	Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber. I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land.
Sandy	Yeah, but this is an accident!
Sandy	Ain't no way a sea critter can run faster than a land critter.
Sandy	Thanks for the face lift! [] You see, I told you that you didn't-
Sandy	Water sucker!
Sandy	Aha! You can't even come up with another name! That proves it!
Sandy	And name calling, for sure!
Sandy	Well, there's just one thing.
Sandy	Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway?
Sandy	Stop laughing at me!
Sandy	Well? So are you going or not?
Sandy	3, 2, 1. Well, tan my fur. They made it! Better congratulate them.  SpongeBob! Patrick? Hmm, where'd those critters get to?  Holy guacamole! You can't eat my friends, you rats with wings! Hiyah!
Sandy	Oh, I can't stand it anymore! That poor, poor critter! What kind of inconsiderate person would upset such a gentle creature?
Sandy	Hey SpongeBob, how come you're all twitchy like that?
Sandy	Ow! Why, you...! Why I oughta...!
Sandy	Well, I don't know nothing about Alaska, but looky here.  Back in Texas I wrangled bulls, and I wrangled worms.  Far as I'm concerned, doing 'em both together just saves rope. Now I'm gonna go kick me some worm tail! Yee-haw!
Sandy	Why not?
Sandy	If that worm ain't got my tail, who does?
Sandy	SpongeBob!
Sandy	You ain't my pa!
Sandy	"And who put the hi-yah, hi, ho, ""K"" in karate?"
Sandy	Say it.
Sandy	No!
Sandy	This shouldn't take long.
Sandy	Boy, howdy. This critter put up some sort of fight. But I'm from Texas, and as you can see, no worm is a match for me. I even found my tail!
Sandy	Run faster!
Sandy	Can we talk about this another time?
Sandy	Not now!
Sandy	I've got it! SpongeBob, you still got that paper clip and that string?
Sandy	Howdy, SpongeBob!
Sandy	And I need an elevator to climb one stair! HI-YA!
Sandy	SpongeBob, are you ready?
Sandy	Oh, I'm Sandy alright.  I'm very Sandy.  Hi-yah!
Sandy	Hey, what's everybody waitin' in line for?
Sandy	Got any more tattoos?
Sandy	Oh, dern near everything, I guess. Cattle roping and pie eating and wood chopping and flying!
Sandy	That's to save paper. You'll need this special reading scope.
Sandy	And this is the robot warehouse. It's where I keep all my robots.
Sandy	This here is my worm incubator. They're not set to hatch for weeks, but I just thought I'd show it to you anyway. And last but not least is my collection of rare and fragile artifacts that has to be cleaned twice daily. Now are you sure you can handle all that, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Okay.
SpongeBob	I'm ready!  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready!
SpongeBob	I can't, don't you see? I'm not good enough!
SpongeBob	I am!
SpongeBob	I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, please. Ill prove I'm fry cook material. Ask Squidward, he'll vouch for me.
SpongeBob	Do do do do do do, spatula, spatula, port-and-starboard attachments.
SpongeBob	Front end... check. Antenna...  check. Bumper... check. Bumper sticker...  ...check.  Tire pressure!  ...check. Vehicle inspection complete! We're really making history here Squidward. That lucky customer is going to get the first Krabby Patty Pizza ever.
SpongeBob	Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me.
SpongeBob	Okay, okay.
SpongeBob	Backing up! Backing up! Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ack-i-i-i-i-i-ng up!  Backing up. Backing up. Backing up. Backing up.
SpongeBob	The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza...
SpongeBob	Truck! 16 wheels. Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhiked.  Whee... eee...
SpongeBob	I do!
SpongeBob	No! Its for the customer!
SpongeBob	That's right. Moss always points to civilization.
SpongeBob	The Krusty Krab pizza absolutivally.  pizza...  pizza...  Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, yeah, for you and  me!  Krab Pizza... for you. Krus... the Krusshy and the... Krab and the... pizza inside.
SpongeBob	No, we promised it's for the customer.
SpongeBob	Okay, its fine.
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	Get away!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	No, really Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved!
SpongeBob	I can't wait to see the look on our customers face!
SpongeBob	But, you didn't order any...
SpongeBob	No drink?
SpongeBob	Does this mean I get to make a Krabby Patty now?
SpongeBob	Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob	Can I make a Krabby Patty now-
SpongeBob	Boom! 19 seconds! That's a new record, Lou!
SpongeBob	"Let's see Gary, according to the ""Plan Your Own Party Kit,"" invitations are the first order of business."
SpongeBob	"Good question Gary, but not to worry. The ""Plan Your Own Party Kit"" warns that unsupervised parties can lead to disaster. That's why I've taken the liberty of devising a schedule!  8:00-8:05: Guests arrive. 8:05-8:15: Opening remarks and general discussion. 8:15-8:27: Craft corner, followed by name tag distribution.  At 8:27, we begin the qualifying rounds for our cracker-eating slash tongue-twister contest. 9:07: running charades.  9:38: charity apple-bob.  9:57: Electric jitterbug dance marathon, ladies' choice.  At 10:09, things start cooking as I dig into my world-famous knock-knock joke vault!"
SpongeBob	Welcome Patrick! May I compliment you on being fashionably late? Can I get you a glass of punch?
SpongeBob	Hmmm, nice weather we're having.
SpongeBob	Two down, 175 to go. Oh, I almost forgot...  These name tags eliminate the need for awkward introductions.  Oh, more guests!
SpongeBob	Oh, uhh, sorry to hear about that.
SpongeBob	Attention everyone. Attention please! Now that we're all here, I officially declare the party switch to be in the 'on' position!  As soon as I get back from the coat room, we'll have a rundown of tonight's schedule. Try not to have too much fun without me!  Seriously.
SpongeBob	Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me?  Oh no!  They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing!  Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs!  Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it!
SpongeBob	What? I-. No! Patrick! Wait!
SpongeBob	I hope this doesn't interfere with finger puppet theater at 9:20! If I don't get back inside soon and restore order, there might not be enough time for the scheduled events!
SpongeBob	Boy, for a second there, I thought I was going to be arrested for breaking into my own house. What an ironic twist that would have been.
SpongeBob	All night in the stony lonesome in a bunny outfit!  Oh, yeah, the door's locked.  Good thing I keep a spare key...under the mat. Grr!  Oh, look at this place! This party was a complete disaster.
SpongeBob	SquarePants, you've done it again. I guess I know how to throw a party after all.  Gary! Well it looks like you had a good time.
SpongeBob	Okay,  see you tomorrow!
SpongeBob	Look at all these glossy depictions of a higher standard of living!
SpongeBob	What kind of things?
SpongeBob	No, something real, an item, something you would pay for.
SpongeBob	O.K. Patrick, this is it! The first step on our road to living fancy! Just follow my lead.
SpongeBob	Woooooooow... what is it?
SpongeBob	We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one?
SpongeBob	-lady.  We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic.
SpongeBob	NO, wait Patrick!
SpongeBob	I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try.
SpongeBob	We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that were too easily distracted.
SpongeBob	Remember Patrick, focus.
SpongeBob	There's something to this selling game were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that!
SpongeBob	That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth!
SpongeBob	We're selling chocolate.  Is your mother home?
SpongeBob	It'll make your hair grow.
SpongeBob	They'll bring world peace!
SpongeBob	Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation.
SpongeBob	Careful, put him down gently.
SpongeBob	Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures.
SpongeBob	Thank you for your patronage.
SpongeBob	Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	Holy oil spill! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch enemies: Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble!
SpongeBob	Okay!
SpongeBob	Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were the most heroic heroes ever! And you had the best lunch box, too.
SpongeBob	Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef!
SpongeBob	Get it off! Get it off!  Whew...I'm glad that's over!
SpongeBob	I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone?
SpongeBob	Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime!
SpongeBob	I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'till 9:00.
SpongeBob	And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge.
SpongeBob	Oh now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem!  74.
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	You, Patrick, she's the teacher!
SpongeBob	I thought of something funnier than 24.
SpongeBob	Big Fat Meanie? Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!
SpongeBob	No!   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
SpongeBob	Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here.  It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway?  'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?
SpongeBob	What?!
SpongeBob	Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one!
SpongeBob	Detention!?
SpongeBob	I'd hate you even if that made sense.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry your apology is so long.
SpongeBob	We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life!
SpongeBob	Congratulations, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Okay!
SpongeBob	Aye aye, captain!
SpongeBob	Actually, it's Coral Blue number t...  three.
SpongeBob	Squidward, he's lost something near and dear to him. Haven't you...
SpongeBob	Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives.  Why couldn't it have been me?!
SpongeBob	What did you give him?
SpongeBob	Good morning, world! I'm ready! World?
SpongeBob	Training?
SpongeBob	You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine.
SpongeBob	Kelp powder for muscle mass.  Raw eggs, 'cause they're clich.  And nails for toughness.
SpongeBob	Boy, the competition's getting tough.  That's it, Gary.  We are going to start some serious training right now.
SpongeBob	Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious.  Come on, Gary, move it!  Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down!  Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go!  Come on, push it, Gary, push it!  Move that shell!  Come on, Gary, move it!  Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster!  Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it...  Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke.  Come on, Gary, we're gonna be late for the big race!
SpongeBob	Alright Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it.
SpongeBob	Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now!  Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary!  Go, go, go, go, go!
SpongeBob	Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster!  Huh?
SpongeBob	You can take a break now if you want to, Gary.
SpongeBob	You did?  Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!
SpongeBob	Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Are you ready to
SpongeBob	What do you think we should do first?
SpongeBob	I just want to warn you, Mr. Krabs. We're always fashionably late.
SpongeBob	I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Only the cool kids.
SpongeBob	Here we are: The Wash.
SpongeBob	You guys want another rinse cycle? I'm buying.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, you will.  Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  Art thou feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  Can you feel it now, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	We score here all the time.
SpongeBob	Sorry, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill.
SpongeBob	Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders.
SpongeBob	Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings.  He won't like it.
SpongeBob	Yes sir.  Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility...
SpongeBob	Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning.
SpongeBob	I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.
SpongeBob	Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!
SpongeBob	Hooray, Gary! We're finally huge!
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone! It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live?
SpongeBob	Alright, Patrick, lets get to work!
SpongeBob	One bedroom.
SpongeBob	Good night, rockmate.
SpongeBob	No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
SpongeBob	Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?
SpongeBob	Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here.  Thanks, buddy.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you.
SpongeBob	Just give me a minute.  I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble.  You hold too many memories.  Well, Squidward, this is goodbye.
SpongeBob	I'm listening to you, mountain!  Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Huh?  Don't worry guys, everything is under control because I'm an...  EXPEEEEEEEEEERRRRRTTT...!  Huh, that's funny. Someone turned the mountain upside down!  AHHHHHH!!!!!
SpongeBob	You heard the doctor, SpongeBob. One more injury like that, then it's the Iron Butt! I've been too careless back there. From now on, I am on around the clock butt patrol.  Hep, hep, hep! Stay away from the backside I'm warning you!
SpongeBob	Hello, friends. Enjoying the outside world?
SpongeBob	I was wrong to go against nature. I'm a sponge. What was I thinking? WalkingMy people are sedentary.
SpongeBob	I'm a sponge! I'll just filter-feed.
SpongeBob	Never ever never never ever ever never!!
SpongeBob	Look at those fools. Risking their lives, jellyfishing! My new hobby is much more safer, isn't it Chip? Dust collecting!  I think I caught one!
SpongeBob	Huh?  Oh, my gosh!  This can't be happening!  This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about!  Well, they were asking for it. It's not like I didn't warn them about the dangers of outside. Yes, Chip, I know they're my two dearest friends in the world, but I told them, I wasn't going outside no matter what. We can do without the name calling, thank you very much, Used Napkin! I know, Chip. If I was out there, bagged by an ape, Patrick and Sandy would risk anything to save me. And I've got to do the same for them. If I don't come back alive, Chip, take good care of Gary.
SpongeBob	Well, time to punch that clock. [] But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar.  You are a winner.  And today's the first day of summer!  Happy first day of summer, Squidward!  Care to join me for solstice caroling?  Walking in the grass, it's so fine, don't need shoes in the summertime!
SpongeBob	The money?
SpongeBob	I've been taught the true meaning of summer.
SpongeBob	See anything, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Krabby Land, sir?
SpongeBob	Hey, kids!
SpongeBob	Well, you've never seen my bubbles.  Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?
SpongeBob	My eyes!  Whoa!   They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery.  Hey kids, check this out.
SpongeBob	Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.
SpongeBob	Really? He's here?  Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
SpongeBob	When do you want him?
SpongeBob	But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?
SpongeBob	Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer.
SpongeBob	We are camping.
SpongeBob	Just... have fun inside! See you tomorrow.
SpongeBob	But all I...
SpongeBob	That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside?
SpongeBob	Write that down, write that down!
SpongeBob	SpongeBob to Patrick.  Me too.  SpongeBob to Patrick. Help yourself. Over.
SpongeBob	"Well, after a long day of camping, it's nice to unwind with a nice, relaxing campfire song. I call this one ""The Campfire Song Song"". Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song. Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song. And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong. But it'll help if you just sing along..."
SpongeBob	Squidward!  Good! It'll help... it'll help... if you just sing along!  Oh yeah! Ahh, now, wasn't that relaxing?
SpongeBob	What are you saying?
SpongeBob	Okay, that's easy. First off, don't play the clarinet.
SpongeBob	Don't ever eat cheese.
SpongeBob	Or clown shoes.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Maybe it's because you're not wearing your sombrero in a goofy fashion.
SpongeBob	Quick! Jump inside our anti-sea-bear circle before he comes back!
SpongeBob	I should have warned you about crawling.
SpongeBob	That was an oval. It has to be a circle!
SpongeBob	I lost something once. I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity.
SpongeBob	Gary. Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way-- pop!  Enjoy, buddy. Hmm, you know, I've been feeding this to Gary for years, and I don't even know what it tastes like.  Bleah!  Bleah!  Bleah!
SpongeBob	Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people. A great story can't be rushed. However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab.  Order up!  One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart. Enjoy.
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi!
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning.
SpongeBob	Patrick, what are you talking about?
SpongeBob	Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up.  I sure hope this works.  Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it!  So far, so good.  I don't see my name tag up here.  Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way.  Bleah! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick.  Patrick!
SpongeBob	Don't forget your line this time!
SpongeBob	Oh, what's the use? I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection.
SpongeBob	Eh, what is that stench?
SpongeBob	You look over there and I'll look over here.
SpongeBob	Patrick!  Thank you.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I would love to sit here and play Twenty Questions with you, but I've only got  one minute till inspection.  One minute?!  Hurry, Patrick, we don't have much time.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I don't have time for this!
SpongeBob	Yeah, yeah, yeah... the boy who cried name tag. If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock.
SpongeBob	Uh... discovery?  And that's how I got my identity back. Well, that's my story.
SpongeBob	Ooh, how weird! A machine made to look like a customer.
SpongeBob	Huh?   Ooh!  Phew! I salute you, oh majestic jellyfish.  Your command of the sky is unmatched. Floating just out of the reach of my net, but near enough that I can see your untamed beauty.  If only I could join you there in the air. Floating free without a care. I wish I could fly. And see things with a different eye.  I would fly so very high and touch the sky.  And never have to ask why it is that I can't fly  Wait a minute, I'm forgetting the words of Grandpa SquarePants.
SpongeBob	What's so funny?
SpongeBob	Well, it took me all night, but here they are. The new blueprints! I wasn't even close with that last one. Propellers, rudders...  This one's gonna fly!  I can feel it. Ready, Patrick?
SpongeBob	No, Patrick. This is the SquarePants Flyer Mark Three.  All you do is remove the brick, or ballast, and...  Huh?  Well, back to the drawing board.
SpongeBob	Do not be afraid, earthbound people. I am not a flying monster, I am just one of you.  D'oh!  Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick!  Excuse me, sir, but I would like to return this kite.
SpongeBob	Go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams!
SpongeBob	Wait for it...
SpongeBob	Aww, yeah.
SpongeBob	Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there saved room for his just desserts.  Yeah, just desserts.
SpongeBob	He seems kind of angry with us, eh, Squidward?  Squidward? Squidward?
SpongeBob	Hey, that looks like me!
SpongeBob	This would be him, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty.
SpongeBob	Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?
SpongeBob	Quick is my middle name!  Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard?
SpongeBob	I'm not sure if these are my pants.  How about this one, bodyguard? Too overbearing?
SpongeBob	Well, Patrick, here it is, the Palace of Pranks, the greatest novelty shop in Bikini Bottom. All the greatest pranksters shop here. This is where I got my gag  seanut brittle can.
SpongeBob	Ah!  Nothing compares to the smell of cheap plastic novelty items.  Pranks, gags, and gross-out toys as far as the eye can see!  Isn't it everything I said it would be, Patrick?
SpongeBob	What can we get  for one dollar?
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Gee, Patrick, just think of the pranks we could pull with this.
SpongeBob	Well, let's get started.
SpongeBob	Patrick, spraying the park bench was my idea.
SpongeBob	Righty, where are you?  No one messes with Righty!  We'll see how you like it!  Kind of gives you an empty feeling, huh?
SpongeBob	Oh, forget the pants, Patrick. Let's get home and wash this paint off.
SpongeBob	Thank you.
SpongeBob	If that guy thought we were ghosts, we could haunt everybody in Bikini Bottom. Oh, it's the ultimate prank.
SpongeBob	"A better question would be, ""Who isn't?"""
SpongeBob	We'll see about that!
SpongeBob	Too late, Krabs, we've already clogged all the toilets.
SpongeBob	I know not these names of which you speak.
SpongeBob	Yeah, I think I'd die of embarrassment if that happened.
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	Squidward's right. That's totally unfair. Couldn't we get to work earlier than six a.m.? Like 5:30 a.m.? Or 5:00 a.m.? Or 4:00 a.m.? Or
SpongeBob	K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y, says I.
SpongeBob	K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y...
SpongeBob	7,121...
SpongeBob	I'm sorry Mr. Krabs. Could you run that by me again?
SpongeBob	No, no! I want to live!  I want to live
SpongeBob	Grill.
SpongeBob	"Oh, but where am I going to find a psychiatrist?  Ow!  Hey, look at this! ""Dr. Peter Lankton: Psychiatrist. Specializing in Krabby Patty phobias"". Gosh, I don't know about this, Krabs; wouldn't I have to miss work if I went to see...  Well, this looks like the place.  Hello? Doctor?"
SpongeBob	Jumping jacks?
SpongeBob	They're coming for me. No! No! No! Stay back!
SpongeBob	Spatula.
SpongeBob	Poh-tah-to
SpongeBob	I'm finished!  I've arranged them into a piano.
SpongeBob	Where am I?
SpongeBob	In my heart?
SpongeBob	Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all.
SpongeBob	Just a second, Squidward. Well, Krabby Patty, it's time for you to go now.  You grew up so fast, I...  Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't do this.  Just take it Squidward, take it away.
SpongeBob	What's a hidey-hole?
SpongeBob	Wow, look at all your cool navy stuff! What's that?
SpongeBob	Wow! Oh-oh. Who are those guys?
SpongeBob	Well, I guess you were thinner back then.
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, sir!  Alright, let's get this place ship shape. You men, stop laying around!  To battle stations.  All hands on deck!  Set course for full flavor.  Ketchup and mustard off the port bow.  One Krabby Patty ready to set sail.
SpongeBob	What's molted?
SpongeBob	Sorry about the foul language, Mr. Krabs, but you're acting like there never was a man in that shell. The Krabs of his navy days was fearless. He wouldn't let something as insignificant as a missing shell slow him down.
SpongeBob	Well, I'm glad you got my point. It's not what's about on the outside. It's what's on the in...
SpongeBob	Look at me, I'm Mr Krabs. I love money.
SpongeBob	Oh, what's that you say? Me daughter, Pearl, needs an operation? I'll do it me self and save a nickel.
SpongeBob	Coming!
SpongeBob	Well, if you think you're man enough.
SpongeBob	I...uhh...
SpongeBob	Me supply of bubble soap was dangerously low. And as I blew my last bubble...
SpongeBob	Oh, I thought you'd see through my ruse. I mean,  arr, you don't think I was just gonna collect this here trophy of manly toughness without reminding you silly livers why you give it to me in the first place. Let's have it. No holding back. Give it your all.
SpongeBob	Look at that, Mr. Krabs. Your navy buddies all had something to hide.
SpongeBob	You know what this means.
SpongeBob	Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful.
SpongeBob	Reflecto has found our secret lab.
SpongeBob	Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him?
SpongeBob	But you can't retire! There's evil afoot.
SpongeBob	What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience.  The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement.
SpongeBob	Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae.  And he globs onto the undersea dome.  And he starts sucking on the glass.
SpongeBob	Oh, my. This purse is so big and heavy.
SpongeBob	Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open.
SpongeBob	Pinch me, I must be dreaming.  Mission accomplished, Patrick.
SpongeBob	The horror, it's unspeakable.  Don't you see, Squidward? It's closed! The Krusty Krab is closed!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Poor Mr. Krabs. What are we going to do, Squidward?
SpongeBob	That's okay, Squidward, you'll warm up to the idea.  Thanks for coming with me, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Cool.
SpongeBob	We noticed how miserable you were on your lumpy, old mattress.
SpongeBob	We gotta get in there, Squidward. Mr. Krabs is counting on us.
SpongeBob	Well, that's Mr. Krabs' mattress, alright. Let's go get it.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, I think I can see our houses from here.
SpongeBob	Understood. Out.
SpongeBob	Affirmative. Out. Oh, that's why he calls himself 'The Retriever'.
SpongeBob	Nice worm. Good, kind, gentle worm.
SpongeBob	We feel silly.
SpongeBob	Happy Halloween, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Not just meat, we're choice cuts! Right, Squidward?
SpongeBob	No, they're usually silver.
SpongeBob	But I...
SpongeBob	But, I'm a...a liability.
SpongeBob	Here I am!
SpongeBob	Yep, right in here.
SpongeBob	Bombs away!
SpongeBob	May it please the court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My client has been called cheap , miserly and chronically tight-fisted. But, if he were as cheap as the prosecution claims he is, would he be able to sit there quietly, while I took out a dollar  and dropped it in the blender ?
SpongeBob	Allow me to rephrase the question. Can you tell the court of some instance of Mr. Krabs' generosity in any way?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I'm surprised at you. We can't give up just because things look bleak. This trial will be won by what's in your heart, not what's in this dumb old case.  It's open!
SpongeBob	Are you sure it wasn't to make off with one of these?  Gotcha. Weren't you there to steal the formula of the most delicious, sweet smelling sandwich known to Bikini Bottom? Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob	"Ahoy, Captain, what have we here? It's a tiny form letter. ""Dear Sir or Ma'am...  We are sorry we missed you. We will attempt to re-deliver your package at our earliest convenience.""  Hello?  My package. Whoopee!  Oh, let's see what we got here.  My official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy paddleball set. Whoo! Yeah!  What's this? ""Take the Dirty Bubble Challenge! Hit the paddleball 29,998,559,671,349 times in a row."" Dirty Bubble, wherever you float, I hereby accept your challenge.  Darn it.  Darn it.  Darn it."
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary, that distracting sound came from you. I'm sorry I can't play with you right now. Mermaid Man needs me.
SpongeBob	Darn it.
SpongeBob	Darn it.
SpongeBob	Why are you crying, Patrick?
SpongeBob	You lost the...? That's terrible! Come on, Pat. Let's have some kelp cookies and some sea horse milkthat always cheers me up when I've lost something. There you are, Patfresh sea horse milk.
SpongeBob	A week? Are you sure?
SpongeBob	This never failsGary's favorite treats. Gary can't resist these babies. They're filled with eight types of organic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of.
SpongeBob	Gary!
SpongeBob	I doubt Gary could fit in there.
SpongeBob	Gary.
SpongeBob	Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call okay, Mr. Krabs. You see, my...
SpongeBob	This wouldn't be the first time I disappointed someone who was hungry.
SpongeBob	You're right, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Patrick, now is now the time for talking. We've got work to do.
SpongeBob	Come on, Pat, just take these fliers and hand them out.
SpongeBob	I can't cry anymore, Patrick. When Gary left, he took all my tears with him.
SpongeBob	Yeah, like that.  Gary, your purring is making it hard to forget you... GARY! Oh, Gary! [He kisses Gary] So, did you hear any of that, or do I have to repeat myself?
SpongeBob	Thanks, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Wow, Squidward, you flipped him over.  That takes an awful amount of skill.
SpongeBob	Wow, thanks for your help, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Money, money, money, money, money!
SpongeBob	Squid, I think you have a problem.
SpongeBob	Are you ready to be a winner?
SpongeBob	Yeah?
SpongeBob	Quiet, Squidward. I'm being the crane.
SpongeBob	Okay, Squidward, put your quarter in.
SpongeBob	You're a winner!
SpongeBob	Uh-huh.
SpongeBob	Wait, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Hang on, buddy. I got ya.  I guess I can only pick up toys.
SpongeBob	My pleasure, Squidward. That's what good neighbors are for.
SpongeBob	Monster!
SpongeBob	It's a secret.
SpongeBob	Whenever your ready, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Hi, president Squidward! Almost done painting the-
SpongeBob	I hope he's not in danger!
SpongeBob	We're checking to make sure this guy really is a certified foot masseur and not some kind of assassin.
SpongeBob	Gee, Patrick, do you think Squidward was trying to tell us something?
SpongeBob	President Squidward?
SpongeBob	We gotta turn this thing off!  Nope, not it.
SpongeBob	Mr. President-
SpongeBob	Hooray!
SpongeBob	I sure am!
SpongeBob	Krabby O' Mondays?
SpongeBob	Aye aye, sir!
SpongeBob	I tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen to me!
SpongeBob	Good one, Squidward!  Another day, another nickel.
SpongeBob	Ok, Squidward, see ya tomorrow.
SpongeBob	I don't?
SpongeBob	Yeah, a little.
SpongeBob	My laugh box?
SpongeBob	I don't wanna burn out my laugh box, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Patrick, banana peel, don't!
SpongeBob	Wait, Patrick, I can't laugh.
SpongeBob	It's terrible, Patrick. I can't laugh anymore!
SpongeBob	I lost my laugh.
SpongeBob	Maybe I should ask Sandy. She's a scientist.
SpongeBob	Thank you, Sandy.
SpongeBob	But Squidward, I...I broke my laugh box!
SpongeBob	I guess I did.
SpongeBob	Hey, you laugh just like me.  Ah, there he goes off to share his laugh with the world.
SpongeBob	How's that mutton, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Mr. Seahorse, sir, you're gentle on beginners, aren't you?
SpongeBob	Whoa, they really go that extra mile for authenticity. Salutations fellow knights.
SpongeBob	Squidward, what are you doing here?
SpongeBob	They sure do take their role-playing seriously around here.
SpongeBob	Because, umm, Squidly has thought of some brilliant songs for the king and he just has to hear them. Isn't that right, Squidly?
SpongeBob	Sorry.
SpongeBob	Well, I guess this is it, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Lemme guess, more praise for our heroic stature?
SpongeBob	At last, an honest man of the soil. Observe, as a I effortlessly commingle with this brutish native.  Greetings, iron man. I am Sir SpongeBob of Bikini  ...Bottom.
SpongeBob	That's perfect!
SpongeBob	Medieval Sandy! I know how to handle this: With a little karate!
SpongeBob	I don't understand a word you just said!  Uhh, Medieval Sandy, you don't look so good. Sandy? Sandy?  Patrick, it's working. Do it again.
SpongeBob	Hang on, Pearl, we're coming to rescue you!  We're a-comin'. Almost there. Oh, dear Neptune.
SpongeBob	You truly are the nastiest wizard in all of Bikini Bottomshire. Prepare to be vanquished.
SpongeBob	Well, I guess this is it, Pat.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, it's a good thing.
SpongeBob	Oh, I guess I shouldn't have agitated that seahorse. That was some dream, huh, Patrick? Patrick?
SpongeBob	Terribly sorry, sir.  Will there be anything else?
SpongeBob	And this devilishly handsome sponge is your waiter.
SpongeBob	Actors? How can they make a Mermaid Man movie without the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
SpongeBob	Too old for an action movie...huh.
SpongeBob	They have shunned our heroes.
SpongeBob	Yes! And in doing so, we will right the wrong done to you by the evil Drippy Brother Studios and...  their actors.
SpongeBob	Let's start with...the title.
SpongeBob	Underground...
SpongeBob	Longer, yes. Ok, let's have Mermaid Man get his face shrunk by Kelp-Thing's face minimizer.
SpongeBob	Sure, Mr Krabs, Pearl can be in our movie.
SpongeBob	Pearl is the leading lady. Mr Krabs will cater the affair.
SpongeBob	Not makeup department, you're the makeup artist.
SpongeBob	They're beautiful.  They look just like they did 30 years ago.  Ok...action!
SpongeBob	That villain isn't even in this movie. But let me see if we have something that fits your qualifications. Oh, here's something.  You can be the boom operator.
SpongeBob	"Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's ""stolen Krabby Patties."""
SpongeBob	Cue the sound effects.
SpongeBob	Patrick, what is that?
SpongeBob	The movie's ruined! We can't make a movie.
SpongeBob	And here comes the filling!  The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club. I knew you'd come to see the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie.
SpongeBob	One cryin' Johnny comin' up! First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up!
SpongeBob	Yep. I hear talk you're kinda picky.
SpongeBob	But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on!  Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles?
SpongeBob	Okay, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let's see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then pickles? No! That's not right!  Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the pickles? No!  Mustard down, bun stuff down d'oh, where's the patty go?  Pickles, ketchup, wait! Think! Think! I'm losin' it!  Bun down, shoe, mustard, pan, bun... no!  Mr. Krabs, I am so confused. I can't remember how to do anything.
SpongeBob	Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or...  D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow.  Good-night, Gary.
SpongeBob	Gary!
SpongeBob	I think don't ready back to go to work, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	No, no, no, no, no.  I got it! I got it! It's all very clear to me now, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	I'm right here, Bubble Bass.
SpongeBob	I didn't.
SpongeBob	Hip hip...
SpongeBob	You're it.  Wait, Pat, you're it!  The sign!
SpongeBob	Well, let's stop laughin' and start fishing'!  Go ahead, you get first crack.
SpongeBob	OK...what do you wanna do?
SpongeBob	C'mon Patrick, let's do something fun.
SpongeBob	Time for another glorious day at work.  Good morning, Squidward!  And isn't it a lovely morning? Why are you playing the clarinet on your way to work?
SpongeBob	Whoa!  Where'd it go?
SpongeBob	Gee, Sandy, this sure feels...
SpongeBob	Yeah, me too.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, I'll drive.
SpongeBob	Squidward, everybody knows I'm a sponge. I look nothing like a balloon.
SpongeBob	Time is money. Right.  Hello bun. At last we meet.
SpongeBob	Now go out there and give them the best darn show they've ever seen.
SpongeBob	Squidward, I wouldn't--!
SpongeBob	They weren't overcooked at all!
SpongeBob	Ooh!
SpongeBob	Why, thank you, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Oh, yes, sir!
SpongeBob	Your room, sir.
SpongeBob	Sorry, Mr. Krabs! We were all out of cheese.
SpongeBob	Me, too.
SpongeBob	Start the engine?
SpongeBob	I failed?
SpongeBob	Yes, sir! I'm ready to drive
SpongeBob	Left turn.  Crack. Bump. Nickel. Hey a nickel!
SpongeBob	Sir, yes, sir!
SpongeBob	Watch for pedestrians. Check mirrors. Observe that speed limit. Watch for pedestrians!  So, umm, how'd I do?
SpongeBob	Really? I'm ready! I'm ready. I'm...
SpongeBob	Step 2 would be... ignite engine.
SpongeBob	Aye aye, sir.  There you go, sir. All I had to do was unscrew two of the bolts.
SpongeBob	Hey, I can't see!  Did I pass?
SpongeBob	Behold, Patrick! The official Goofy Goober Backscratcher! And it only cost me 52 box tops.
SpongeBob	You know, we shouldn't keep this all to ourselves. We should let Squidward try it out.
SpongeBob	Who?
SpongeBob	"It's saying... ""It's dark in here."" Got anything else, Sandy?"
SpongeBob	They're looking for an invention, right?
SpongeBob	That's a pencil, Patrick. It's already been invented.
SpongeBob	Ooh... I give up. I'll never invent anything.
SpongeBob	Why, everyone in town has benefited from Sandy's scientific knowledge! Before Sandy showed up, I used to be a scrawny weakling!
SpongeBob	She should be back any moment.
SpongeBob	Well?
SpongeBob	Patrick, don't you think we should test it?
SpongeBob	Pudding? I don't remember that part of the invention.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Sandy. We were trying to keep you in Bikini Bottom, but all we did was ruin your chances to stay.
SpongeBob	Squidward! Squidward!  Squidward! Help!
SpongeBob	Gary!
SpongeBob	Um, Dutchie? Is this gonna be much longer?
SpongeBob	Oh, no, no. I meant that I'm just used to it, that's all.
SpongeBob	Sure, relax a little.
SpongeBob	Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! EVERYONE, GET OUT!!!
SpongeBob	Yes, you are. But we're going to raise you up from your squalled conditions through the use of visual aids. Watch now.
SpongeBob	Now that's The Flying Dutchman I know. Let's see you put those words into action.
SpongeBob	Dutchie, it worked! You got your scare back!
SpongeBob	Yes, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Wow.
SpongeBob	I'd like to buy that piece of plastic with this piece of plastic.
SpongeBob	Oh, no, I bought the wrong present.
SpongeBob	I'm back, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Just watch.  Hit it boys!
SpongeBob	All right, Gary, ready for your yearly shell waxing?
SpongeBob	Special delivery? Just for me? You think I'm...special?
SpongeBob	King of Karate?
SpongeBob	Oh, sure, Sandy, all the big karate experts go there.
SpongeBob	What make you think that's Karate Island?
SpongeBob	Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. Mr. Udon isn't interested in a karate novice like you. They only have time for royalty.
SpongeBob	The one and only.
SpongeBob	Come, Sandy, take your place next to the king and share in my crowning achievement.  Bring a seat for my air-breathing friend.
SpongeBob	Sandy's going to miss out, big time.
SpongeBob	No, Sandy!
SpongeBob	Sandy, I'm sorry I acted like a jerk back there. Thanks for saving me from...  buying a condo.
SpongeBob	Oh dear Neptune.
SpongeBob	WHAT?! There is only  spatula for me, and that is Spat. Spat, wait up! Spat!  I'm coming Spat!
SpongeBob	Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry.
SpongeBob	Now?
SpongeBob	Now?
SpongeBob	Thanks, Squidward. It was worth every penny.
SpongeBob	Oh, just the answer to our little production dilemma.
SpongeBob	No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master.
SpongeBob	One Krabby Patty, coming up lickity split.  Spat, is there something wrong, pal?
SpongeBob	Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Spatula?? It can't be true. It's too late!
SpongeBob	Spatula!  Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better!  Spatula, what's wrong?  But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry-y-y-y! Oh, what have I done? What have I done?
SpongeBob	I'll never find another spatula like him, again which means the Krusty Krab is out of business.  Spatula? You're back!  Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us.
SpongeBob	Always the kidder, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Well, I do. This well's gonna make a lot of dreams come true.  What's the first thing you're gonna wish for?
SpongeBob	When you throw all your dreams down the well.  Well, Squidward, what do you think?
SpongeBob	A Promotion?  Why do I have to go down in the well?
SpongeBob	Our very first wish! I can't wait till it comes...
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	Patrick, you're supposed to let go of the coin when you throw it.
SpongeBob	Tag, you're it.
SpongeBob	I did great, Mr Krabs. I got a nickel from Sandy, 2 pennies from Mrs. Puff, a penny from Plankton...  ...and this slightly used pair of dentures.
SpongeBob	Can we come out now?
SpongeBob	Next to being a fry cook, it's the most important thing I've ever done.
SpongeBob	No, it's true! We did find the magic. Oh, I wish you could see it.  Squidward! You decided to join the party.
SpongeBob	Maybe if you had more upper arm strength.
SpongeBob	Umm, Squidward, you're standing on my foot.
SpongeBob	Bye, Squidward. Enjoy your trip!
SpongeBob	That's great, Sandy!
SpongeBob	Is that proof enough for ya?
SpongeBob	I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First I have to make my speech.
SpongeBob	I overdid the speech again, didn't I?
SpongeBob	A-hoo!  Thanks, Mrs. Puff!
SpongeBob	The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example.  I'm the open window maniac!  I hope you learned a valuable lesson!  On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol...  Vandals! Another crime.  hmm...strawberry! I must act!  Patrick...  Patrick... Patrick...
SpongeBob	I'm down here.
SpongeBob	Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wreck? Break-in? Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
SpongeBob	This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies!  And now, duty calls! Alright deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run em out!
SpongeBob	Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back.
SpongeBob	That's where I am. He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?
SpongeBob	Yes, Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium.
SpongeBob	Right away, sir.
SpongeBob	Gary's not misbehaved!
SpongeBob	Affirmatory.
SpongeBob	Yup, yup, yup.
SpongeBob	[shocked due to the news; people screaming] Gary?  I can't believe that sweet and slimy snail would cause all this destruction.
SpongeBob	That's right. So let me in before I'm eaten.
SpongeBob	Gary! Are you okay, buddy? Come here, boy.
SpongeBob	No, I won't let you touch Gary.
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary, I knew you weren't disease-ridden. You still love me?
SpongeBob	Time off?
SpongeBob	That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary.  Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward.
SpongeBob	But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.
SpongeBob	I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work.  My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside!
SpongeBob	You have my word, sir. No working.  Hey Pat, it's time for your lunch...  Patrick, you can't do that!
SpongeBob	But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up.
SpongeBob	You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house.
SpongeBob	Somebody help, I'm stuck!  Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here.  Mr. Krabs?  Noooo!!  Uh oh.
SpongeBob	My house is back that way, Mr. K.
SpongeBob	Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire like that? Like trash? I don't think so!
SpongeBob	Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!
SpongeBob	Yippee! I happily acquiesce.
SpongeBob	Patrick, the only thing attacking me is you!
SpongeBob	It's my new look. I'm wearing a wig.
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Can you believe I found it lying around in the street?
SpongeBob	Yes, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Ever since I've been wearing it, everyone I see gets a big grin on their face.
SpongeBob	Glad you like it.  I'll see you later, Sandy.  Two krabby patties and a side order of looking good.
SpongeBob	This isn't good. Everyone's getting jealous.  Squidward, I'll be hiding in the kitchen if you need me.
SpongeBob	I don't understand.
SpongeBob	That tickles.
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs...
SpongeBob	Why would I want to get rid of my wig? Look at how happy it makes everybody.
SpongeBob	Shhh! It's very rude to talk during a movie! [growling]
SpongeBob	I guess you're right, Sandy. I got so much enjoyment out of the wig, myself, I assumed everyone else did, too.
SpongeBob	Wigs. Wigs, wigs, they're everywhere.
SpongeBob	Wow. Ned and the Needlefish wearing my wig. So, I was cool before anyone else?
SpongeBob	Ocean wave.  Tropical breeze.
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward, you've swallowed your clarinet again. I'll get it.
SpongeBob	There's only one thing to do. We gotta see Sandy.
SpongeBob	Hell,o citizen.
SpongeBob	You're right!  Patrick, you're a genius!
SpongeBob	Where are we, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Um...we broke it.
SpongeBob	Ew! Where are we?   Mayday! Mayday! We're sinking! And Patrick won't stop screaming!
SpongeBob	Wow.
SpongeBob	SpongeBob to Sandy. We've reached the foreign obstruction.
SpongeBob	You're right Patrick. Whirlpool Spin!
SpongeBob	Who did?
SpongeBob	Umm, Patrick, those are my clothes.
SpongeBob	Wait! Stop! What about all our plans?  8:00am - Wake up Patrick, 9:00am - Eat Kelpo with Patrick, 10:00am - Brush Teeth with Patrick, 1:00pm - Stare at Patrick. Who's gonna do all that with me?
SpongeBob	Well, Pat, that disguise didn't work. We're gonna have to try harder.
SpongeBob	Patrick, there already is a Mr. Seaweed Monsterman.
SpongeBob	...tricia. Pat-ricia. Patricia!
SpongeBob	C'mon, Patricia.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	What's the matter, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Get outta town! To beautiful Sunny Seashores Resort. Look, this guy wasn't trying to run you out of town, he just wanted to sell you a luxury vacation at a modest price.
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Uh, Squidward, could you turn it down a little?
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	Hi, stranger. I am SpongeBob.  Wait a minute. Maybe he's not a monster. Maybe he's an endangered species. We should help him.
SpongeBob	Yeah, Gary's never attacked anyone like that except Squidward. I guess Smelly can't live here.
SpongeBob	Smelly.  Excuse me. Pardon me. If I can just scootch through there. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. You leave Smelly alone. He's just a poor, dumb wild animal.
SpongeBob	No one should be treated like that. Not even someone as ugly as Smelly. Something needs to be done about this. And I know exactly what that thing is.  Ok, Patrick, remember the plan?
SpongeBob	Shh, we'll get caught.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Smelly, you're safe with us.
SpongeBob	You're right, Patrick. That must be the way out. Whoa... where are we?  Let's go ask those guys. Um, excuse us.  Hey, they look just like you. Go, be with your real family. Go ahead, Smelly. I know you've come to think of us as a family, but it's better this way.
SpongeBob	I want to impress and amaze my friends!
SpongeBob	Silly Squidward. I won't learn vanishing spells until I become a level 10 wizard.  No, I better start with something simpler.  Say card conjuring.  Here, hold this simple, playing card while I transform it into a magic playing card before your very eyes. Let's see...  step 1...
SpongeBob	"And finally, say the words ""Hobris-Pobris"".  Squidward! My simple card-trick has turned you into an ice- cream cone. Which means...I am a level ten wizard! I suppose I should change you back to squid form.  Presto!  Uh, let's see. Alakazam!  Abracadabra.  Okilee-dokilee. Hobra-cobra. Oh! Open sesame. Change-o back-o to Squidward-o, please-o? Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward.  I've transformed you into a delicious dairy dessert and I can't change you back! There, there, Squidward. There is no need to cry. I promise you will continue your normal life despite the fact that you are now edible.  Whoa oh!  Speak to me. Speak!  Hey Squid, are you okay?  Hey Squid, are you still okay?  Hey Squidward, I got something for you! Someone to keep you company in that drab ol' freezer.  Oh, aren't they cute? I promise to stand by as an eternal guard over my buddy."
SpongeBob	Yeah. I turned him into a tasty soft-serve with a waffle cone.
SpongeBob	Look, Patrick!! Don't you understand!?  This isn't just your ordinary ice-cream cone.
SpongeBob	It is I, SpongeBob of the SquarePants, Magician Level 1. And I have turned my friend into ice-cream.
SpongeBob	But if you don't my friend will be a cone forever.
SpongeBob	But, sir, no one else has your power of sorcery.
SpongeBob	Does that mean you can't change my friend back?
SpongeBob	Mister Magic was a fake and all his magic stuff is fake! All those magic words, they were fake. Yacky, shmacky, bappy, dappy, doppy, blabby, flabby...
SpongeBob	I'm ready!  I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?
SpongeBob	57 times.
SpongeBob	I'm a winner.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick. No!
SpongeBob	You got a perfect score?
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Two millionth?
SpongeBob	Thanks for the ride, Patrick.
SpongeBob	You got your license.
SpongeBob	Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat.  I'm so tired.
SpongeBob	That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...
SpongeBob	Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I
SpongeBob	Oh?
SpongeBob	Mom!
SpongeBob	40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car.
SpongeBob	You're suppose to stop!
SpongeBob	If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!
SpongeBob	What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait!  Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Ready, pal.  Whoo! Whoo!
SpongeBob	Why?
SpongeBob	"Huh? No, I don't know any starfish. Even if I did know this ""alleged"" starfish, Patrick wouldn't owe any overdue library books."
SpongeBob	When you're a king, you can get anything you want.
SpongeBob	That is correct. Anything you want, and it's all free.
SpongeBob	Hi. By proclamation of the Royal Ministry, the king is entitled to have anything he wants, whatever he wants.
SpongeBob	Umm, his royal highness is building a royal Ferris Wheel.
SpongeBob	Umm, could I get you to sign this treaty promising your eternal loyalty to King Patrick?
SpongeBob	[intimidated of Patrick's rage] Um, well...it's just that, um, you're kinda being a jerk.
SpongeBob	Safety first.  A-ha! I finally gotcha!  Ah, there is nothing better than the taste of natural jelly from a jellyfish. See you later!  Oh, oh my glasses! Thanks little guy! Bye!  I can't play anymore, jellyfish. I got to get home.  No. You can't go home with me.  Jellyfish, you've got to stay here! Hey!  Stay!  Stay...  [exasperated] Jellyfish! For the last time, you cannot come home with me!  Ahh, what the heck!  Squidward! Hey, Squidward! Squidward! Squidwardiard!  Squidward! Look at my new pet!
SpongeBob	Whew! Wow, you sure like to dance. Well, that's enough for tonight. It's time to go to bed.  Huh?  You got it all wrong, little fella.  Bed. Repeat after me.  Bed!  We'll just keep you right here.
SpongeBob	Oh jellyfi-!  Where'd you all come from?  Okay, that's it. Party is over! You guys have overstayed your welcome.  This music is way too loud.  Very funny.  I'm serious!
SpongeBob	Hey, now, that wasn't nice!  Okay, that is it! Everybody out!  Come on Gary!  Gary, you were right. Thanks for not rubbing it in.  Huh? They stopped?  Gary! Don't... stop... shaking it!
SpongeBob	Bloodthirsty bikers? And they're headed straight for Bikini Bottom! I've got to warn everybody! I better take the shortcut!  Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	The Wild Ones are coming, Mr. Krabs. They're the most vicious, ravenous herd of hooligans in the sea.
SpongeBob	"A horrible biker gang called the ""Wild Ones"" are coming. We've got to run, hide!"
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	Hello, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Me!
SpongeBob	And their leather socks.
SpongeBob	Nor I with you, my friend. Let's ride.  Fear not. There is no need to panic. The Bikini Bottom bad boys are here.
SpongeBob	So, Squidward, are you ready to do your part?
SpongeBob	How about our biker organization?
SpongeBob	Please, Mr. Krabs. We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Me? Annoying?  Yeah right.
SpongeBob	Good-bye. They seem really nice. Hey, where's Squidward?
SpongeBob	Hi, Mr Krabs. Hi...Plankton? Uh, Mr Krabs, I'm a little confused. Don't you and Plankton hate each other?
SpongeBob	Mr Krabs, if you want a KelpShake, why don't you just buy one?
SpongeBob	Oh, this year's migration is gonna be a big one!
SpongeBob	Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloid netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world.
SpongeBob	Oh, right. Pants.
SpongeBob	Maybe we should spread out a little.
SpongeBob	Oh! Hello? Hello?
SpongeBob	Hello?
SpongeBob	Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net.  Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday.
SpongeBob	It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to.
SpongeBob	Hmmm...  Patrick, where are you? Why are the lights off?
SpongeBob	What's in your other hand?
SpongeBob	Have I been best friends with a master thief? I must know for sure.  Good morning, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Now, we'll just see what sort of nothing you're really up to, Sneaky McSneakyPants.
SpongeBob	I don't have any binoculars, see?
SpongeBob	Word on the street is that you know where to get quality jellyfishing supplies.
SpongeBob	And why not?
SpongeBob	Why would you steal my jellyfishing net?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Where are you going?
SpongeBob	Ol' Reliable? I left you on the bus?
SpongeBob	So did I.  My best friend made it for me.
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward, want to play?  Okay, Squidward, see ya later.
SpongeBob	How about Duck, Duck, Hermit Krab? Hopscotch? Squidward Says? Steal The Bacon? Sleeping Sea Lions? Sharks & Minnows? Sink The Submarine? Kings & Queens? Mahjong?  Whoa, I've never played this game before. What's it called?
SpongeBob	Uhh, Squidward, he prefers to be addressed by his full name.
SpongeBob	Good one, Mini Squid! You are always such a ray of sunshine. Are you ready for another fabulous day of work at the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	Well, Mini Squid, I guess this is it. We've had some good times playing charades and dancing around like two giddy butterflies!  Remember?
SpongeBob	Yeah, I have something even better!  Another me!
SpongeBob	Why is this the best day ever you ask? Because, Gary, I get to start this wonderful day bringing life to a whole new generation of delicious Krabby Patties, followed by a vigorous mid-day session of karate with Sandy, and an afternoon jellyfishing with Patrick, where I'll unveil my newest, most prized possession: the Deluxe Jelly Slayer Composite Pro! And for the grand finale, every one of my closest friends joining together for Squidward's clarinet recital. I am so excited I think I'm gonna explode!  It's the best day ever
SpongeBob	It's the best day ever
SpongeBob	Oh, just a little something I like to call karate.
SpongeBob	Oh.  Oh. No Krabby Patties, no karate. At least I have jellyfishing with... Hey, there he is now!  Wait for me, Patrick. I've got a brand-new...  What's wrong, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Well, actually, Patrick, that's my brand-new net.
SpongeBob	Now play!
SpongeBob	I'm going to see Squidward play his clarinet. Today's my best day ever.
SpongeBob	SpongeBob, you are so...
SpongeBob	No, it's not okay!  This was going to be my best day ever, starting with doing the best job in the world: working at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	[starting to feel calm] It's not?
SpongeBob	My perfect job starts my perfect day.  Then it's time to kick back, relax and play.
SpongeBob	It's the best day ever
SpongeBob	It's the best day ever
SpongeBob	You got me such an amazing gift, and all I got you was...that.
SpongeBob	Oh, majestic and much masticated Gummy, although I am not worthy to be in your presence, may my humble abode please you.  Oh, you sure a re a big boy, aren't you. Ooh. Hey, I know how to handle this. With a little karate. Hyah!  Ooh. Oh, Gummy, what a beautiful centerpiece you make. With your dirty sock and used toothbrush, flies, and moldy pizza.  Get a hold of yourself, SpongeBob. It's not so bad. After all, it is a gift from Patrick.
SpongeBob	Well, you see, I liked Gummy and I decided to dress him up.  Isn't this a cute look?
SpongeBob	Thanks.  Oh, what am I going to do, Gary? It's hideous.
SpongeBob	All day.
SpongeBob	Yeah, all righty.
SpongeBob	Uh, well, how can I put this?
SpongeBob	It's yours, buddy. But first, you got to get us out of this.
SpongeBob	Why, Mr Krabs? Why does he hate us so?
SpongeBob	Yeah, Mr. Krabs. What did happen next?
SpongeBob	Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen?
SpongeBob	Well, I'm not here for the money.  I'll always treasure these moments we had together.
SpongeBob	Yeah. When this place had class...  Well, we've had some good times, too. Right, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Would you sign my Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob	I'm the new fry cook, sir.
SpongeBob	Am I a fraud?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squidward. Jim won't be leaving. He's taking my job. I'm the one who's leaving!
SpongeBob	Goodbye, grill. Goodbye, pot. Goodbye, pan. So long, fry fat. Goodbye, grease stain.  Goodbye, frozen patty #1. Goodbye, frozen patty #2.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I was just leaving. I'm not fit to inhabit the same kitchen as Jim. So it is with a heavy heart that I relinquish my position as fry cook.
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	"""And slowly... Ever so slowly... The ancient crypt door creeps open... And from the festering brine of the darkest darkness, crawled forth monsters of such vile nature, whose appearance was so hideous and threatening, that the author died trying to recount them in this novel!""  That story is so scary! But it's only a story, right, Gary?  Why don't you sleep up here tonight, Gary?  Well, I guess I should turn off the light now.  Sure is dark.  Oh, it's just a chair! I guess I'm imagining things in the dark.  Woah! Another monster!  Oh, it's just a coral branch. Nothing to be scared of!  What was that?"
SpongeBob	Whenever I blink, I see nothing but the darkness!
SpongeBob	You want me to go in there?
SpongeBob	Great idea, Mr. Krabs.  Night light, night light... Oh!  Oh, it's beautiful!  Excuse me! Are these night lights guaranteed to keep the creepy creatures of the dark away?
SpongeBob	You're right, Gary! I've got darkness inside of me!
SpongeBob	You know what that means?  Sleepover!  Your sleeping bag, sir.
SpongeBob	But, Squidward! Without our night lights, the creepy creatures of the dar-
SpongeBob	Mermaid Man!?!
SpongeBob	Oh my gosh! Mermaid Man needs assistance! There is no need to fear, AbsorboPants is here!
SpongeBob	We're all alone, Patrick. No lights. No shelter.
SpongeBob	Say, Gary, do you ever wonder what Patrick's mornings are like?
SpongeBob	What is it?
SpongeBob	But I don't take up that much space!  See?  I can fit in here.  Mmm, cozy.
SpongeBob	Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?
SpongeBob	Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting.
SpongeBob	What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here?
SpongeBob	Alien repellent? Let me see that.  New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows!
SpongeBob	We don't, we're just spraying the...  ...windows.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?
SpongeBob	Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here and I happen to know that that particular button is right over here.
SpongeBob	We must be landing.
SpongeBob	Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me!  Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier!
SpongeBob	No, it's an egg sac! Let's look at the embryo.
SpongeBob	Well, there's plenty more where those came from.
SpongeBob	It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone.  So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!
SpongeBob	"What's this?  It says a free prize!  Huh? Where's my prize?  ""Free Prize.""  ""Offer inside""! Just send in 99 box tops!  How you doing over there, Gary?"
SpongeBob	We're waiting.
SpongeBob	Yup.  Isn't there anything else?
SpongeBob	Great idea, Patrick. Krusty Krab, here we... wait a minute. What if the mailman comes when I'm gone?
SpongeBob	Not now, I'm busy.  Oh, Gary, not now. Can't you see that I'm waiting for the mailman?! Doesn't anyone understand this?!?  So tired.  So hungry.  But... must wait... for toy.
SpongeBob	My birthday cake.
SpongeBob	I've been mean to Gary and I flipped Sandy, and now you hate me cause... I'm a big jerk!
SpongeBob	...in waiting for... my toy!  Whoo!
SpongeBob	And you broke it...
SpongeBob	I-I ate... bo-bo-box tops. And then... I'm waiting. I'm waiting. And then he came and we're waiting. We're waiting. And then my toy and then you and then snap and then this.
SpongeBob	Gary! What are you doing!?
SpongeBob	What is this stuff, anyway? It doesn't seem to be coming off!  Ooh! Company!
SpongeBob	Ow!!! P-P-P-Patrick, what should I do?
SpongeBob	What makes you say that?
SpongeBob	Huh? Oh, hi, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Help Me!!!
SpongeBob	Where's my snail, Gary?
SpongeBob	Oh, Patrick!!! How many times do I have to tell you? Be careful!!!
SpongeBob	PATRICK!!! What am I gonna do? My bubble is destroyed.
SpongeBob	Ohhhh, noo!  Stop! You're pushing out more of the Ick!!! [the unknown fish the other fish make a final body slam] NOOOOO!!!!!
SpongeBob	Look, Gary! You made me all sparkly! You're the best bottom feeder a sponge could ever have!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm going to be a spy.
SpongeBob	Hey, Sandy.
SpongeBob	What do we do now, Patrick?
SpongeBob	SpongeBob to Krabs. Come in Krabs.
SpongeBob	A... stamp.
SpongeBob	He's getting away! Quick, Patrick, use the jet-packs!
SpongeBob	Agent SpongeBob here.
SpongeBob	Ok, Patrick, we're in position. Now how do we get inside?
SpongeBob	Can't you go later?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Squidward? Then who are you?
SpongeBob	Nah, I'm just kidding.
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet!
SpongeBob	Hi there!
SpongeBob	Exciting reading, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Oh, sure, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Gus!
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward.
SpongeBob	I'm just going to turn out the lights. Clickety poo. And close my eyes and go to sleep.  Just close my eyes and go to sleep.  ...just close my...  Maybe if I run around it'll tire me out.  Oh, I just got to get some sleep! There's only one thing for this.  Ah, that's the stuff. A glass of warm snail milk.  Dah! Why isn't it working--  Whoa, Gary, what happened?  Agh, I'm late for work!  Oh, my gosh, only twenty seconds to go! What the...?  Bridge out?  Hopscotch!  Almost there.  No! Ugh! I'm late. What's Mr. Krabs going to say?
SpongeBob	No! Please don't throw me out in the street! I am so sorry for what I did.
SpongeBob	No! No! You have to punish me!
SpongeBob	I love it here, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	All night, sir.
SpongeBob	Already done, sir.
SpongeBob	Ooh. Hi, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Won't you miss me living next door, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Laundry song, la-la-la! Sing about your laundry all day long. La-la-la-la laundry song.
SpongeBob	It was getting kind of crowded in the kitchen.  So I moved in here.
SpongeBob	Mom! Dad! Come on in.  And this is the guest room. Mom, Dad, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Oh, Mr. Krabs kicked me out, so now we're neighbors again. Hey, my drums!
SpongeBob	Yeah! Your yard is really fun! There are kids playing on it right now!
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.  Pardon me.
SpongeBob	Order up!
SpongeBob	Coming through!  Hi, Patrick.
SpongeBob	You're mine now, Plankton!  You won't get away with this, Plankton.
SpongeBob	Hold it right there, Mr.
SpongeBob	Um, thank you, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Glove World!. Roller coaster. First in line.
SpongeBob	I don't want to ride the Fiery Fist O' Pain!
SpongeBob	Wait for me, Patrick.  Whoo! Fiery Fist O' Pain, here we come.
SpongeBob	That sure looks like fun.
SpongeBob	Oh, barnacles!.  It sure was lucky we found our tickets.
SpongeBob	Can you believe some people are afraid to ride roller coasters?
SpongeBob	I mean, The Mitten.
SpongeBob	We've gone eight times.
SpongeBob	Oh, it's, uh...  very manly, Larry.
SpongeBob	Hurry back so we can go on the ride.
SpongeBob	Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
SpongeBob	Warning! This ride may cause: Crying, screaming, projectile vomiting, amnesia, spine loss, embarrassing accidents, uncontrollable gas...
SpongeBob	On the Fiery Fist O' Pain.
SpongeBob	We made it!
SpongeBob	I didn't know how to tell you because, well, I didn't want to disappoint you.
SpongeBob	We conquered our fears!
SpongeBob	Oh. hi, Squidward. Looky, Mr. Plankton's having us paint. He calls it pizzazz.
SpongeBob	I see what you mean.
SpongeBob	Hey, Plankton? What do you think of the new window? We got it from The Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	And how. Come on, fellows. let's do some interior decorating.
SpongeBob	Someday, I'm going to make you sweetie. Not overtly, but sur-rep-titious-ly. Drum solo!  Dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga, doogadoo. Doo, doo, doo, Doo. Doo! Hey, looks like you guys and gals are done.  In all my years of fry cookery, I have never seen a group of patties. Especially you.  Such perfection from your little lettuce hair to your rosy ketchup cheeks right down to your mustard smile. May I call you Patty?
SpongeBob	I won't let you do this to Patty.
SpongeBob	Enjoy, sir.
SpongeBob	Sorry, Patrick.  I already made plans to go for a walk through Jellyfish Fields with Patty. As soon as the little lady dries her hair, we're heading out.
SpongeBob	Oh, baby. They may call me a fool. But I can't help our gravitational pull. When I stuff you with cotton candy, it reminds me you're so sweet. When we go riding, it's dandy. The way you hang onto that seat. Ba-ay-ay-by.  When I'm with you, Our love is stronger than glue. Oh, baby! There isn't anything. There's nothing in the world, I wouldn't do for you  Hey, let go of her, you Patty-eaters! No! Get away! Hi-yah! Hi-yah!  Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Yah! Yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hiiiiyah! Patty, you okay, sweetums? I'm so sorry! I'll never let you out of my sight again. And I'll always keep you out of harm's way  Oh, baby. Our love is so strong. That's why I'm singing this song. Ba-ay-ay-by. Your looks are sweeter than honey. From your pickles to your buns. It ain't even funny!  I'm coming for you!  Oh, no! Look at you! Don't worry, Patty! I'll take care of this!  There you go! All better Oh, baby!  Oh, Patty. Do you realize what this signifies? Mm-hmm. That's right. It's our six-hour anniversary. And do you know what that means? Are you all right, Patty? You don't seem so hot. Don't worry, I know what'll make you feel better. A dinner at the finest restaurant in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	She's rich in taste.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, Squidward allow me to introduce my date Patty.
SpongeBob	How about now?
SpongeBob	Squidward, what are you doing with my beautiful patty?
SpongeBob	Um, not quite, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Oh, uhh, Mr. Krabs, can I get my paycheck?
SpongeBob	Who's that?
SpongeBob	And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward. Do you like my new boots? Pretty cool, huh? Now, I'm an official fry cook!
SpongeBob	Or could he do this?  Or this?  And watch this, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Gary, these boots have changed my life. I'm never taking them off.
SpongeBob	Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!
SpongeBob	They're not the ! You were right. I wasn't ready for those blessed boots.
SpongeBob	You really think so, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	We come here every morning.
SpongeBob	Can I tell it this time, Squidward? Pretty please? Whenever Squidward sees us, the storm clouds in his brain roll in and a nasty storm rages. So, Squidward's happy gland is forced to take shelter in the recesses of his mind. But the happy gland can't find a recess deep enough, so he gets the flu and has to stay in bed until we leave.
SpongeBob	Thanks for sharing this moment with us, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Let's do it again.
SpongeBob	Yeah, they're pretty adorable.
SpongeBob	No, no. I mean he seems happier.
SpongeBob	S-S-Squidward! Aren't you supposed to be out front?
SpongeBob	Oh, these will never do. Besides, it takes years of practice and you'd never be up to it.
SpongeBob	Actually, Squidward, in point of fact, I've been Employee of the Month a gazillion and six times. Keep dreaming.
SpongeBob	Dimples? It was him! No, Squidward did it.
SpongeBob	Mm-hmm?
SpongeBob	Oh, so what if New Squidward is a better cook than you?  Doesn't matter. And so what if Squidward replaced you as Employee of the Month? And so what if New Squidward is pogo-dancing with your best friend?  Pogo-dancing with your best friend?!  Stop!  Maybe you can take my job, and maybe you can take my place on the Employee of the Month Wall of Fame. But nobody and I mean nobody, pogo-dances with that guy  but me. Now do yourself a big fat favor and get out, bub!  You know, Patrick. maybe I was a little hard on New Squidward. I mean, he might be a good fry cook. and he might have his picture on the wall, but I still have the best friend in the world  I know. I'll go apologize. Come on.  Squidward, I just want to say I'm sorry for being so selfish, and yelling at you and all. I mean, who cares about cooking, pictures on the wall and dancing. We're bigger than that, right? So, if you're willing to let bygones be bygones, then I'm willing to meet you half way. What do you say, buddy? Put her there.
SpongeBob	May I help you, sir?
SpongeBob	No problem, I was just telling this customer he needed to wait for his favorite table.
SpongeBob	Wouldn't it be neat if money could talk?
SpongeBob	Hello... money.
SpongeBob	I don't know. He's acting kind of weird.
SpongeBob	He was five bucks short on payday.
SpongeBob	I won't be defeated!
SpongeBob	Whoo, yeah!
SpongeBob	You built us a trophy case for when we win?  Oh, you are a true friend.
SpongeBob	You kidder. Let's go, Patrick.
SpongeBob	You're just not getting into the spirit of this thing, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Yes, yes I am.
SpongeBob	I guess they're happy.
SpongeBob	You know what, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Now, before I begin, let me just thank you all for coming out tonight.
SpongeBob	Um, Squidward, is this part of the act?
SpongeBob	Well, back to work.
SpongeBob	Oh. you mean like when Squidward had that mole taken of his
SpongeBob	Okay, Mr. Krabs. I really think I should be getting back to the grill, now.
SpongeBob	Please, you don't understand! They're all splotchy and yellow with distended bellies.  Open up, open up, open up, open up.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, what have you done? You poisoned all these people.
SpongeBob	Patrick, it's me!
SpongeBob	Have you ever thought about turning one of your poems into a hit song on the radio?
SpongeBob	Hey, that's my comic book money!
SpongeBob	Good luck.  Coming--
SpongeBob	Why would I hit you with a dodgeball?
SpongeBob	Oh, I don't even own a dodgeball. Do you, Gary?
SpongeBob	Come on, let's hear it!
SpongeBob	It's really loud!
SpongeBob	Darn, I just got that arm back.
SpongeBob	I got an idea!  We just have to play your record from the top of this antenna.
SpongeBob	Yes, that is important. But I was thinking about music! Turn it up, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Why, he's right here. Patrick Star, Musical Genius.
SpongeBob	She won't be back for one more hour, 26 minutes and 47 seconds.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, that's your mother. But that does give me an idea. We'll throw Sandy the mother of all welcome home parties! Patrick, to the treedome!
SpongeBob	I knew it! You have been itching to see us.
SpongeBob	Are you okay, Sandy?
SpongeBob	Uh, you're welcome, Sandy. Hey, uh, are you still up for some karate chops?
SpongeBob	He tickles! Oh, this isn't so bad!  Ow!  He bit me! Got any more of those fancy collars, Sandy?
SpongeBob	Um, is that what over looks like?
SpongeBob	Uh, thanks for having us, Sandy, but we gotta go.
SpongeBob	Stop smudging my helmet!
SpongeBob	Would you like another spot of tea, Ms. Nibsy? Oh, you would?
SpongeBob	Hey, Star. It's SquarePants. That was some party last night, huh, buddy?
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, I-  *Gasp* Donut! You monster...! You monster!  Nothing goes with a video like toast, Let's pop some toast in the toaster and watch this bad boy!
SpongeBob	Are you ready to-
SpongeBob	Of course! It was your birthday!
SpongeBob	There ya go, little buddy. Now everybody's all clean and ready for beddy-bye.
SpongeBob	...till everything's ship-shape, sir. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'll get this plate cleaned up in a jiffy.
SpongeBob	OK, you asked for it. It may end life as we know it, but I am crossing the beams!  More power!
SpongeBob	Maximum power! Ahhhhh!
SpongeBob	Hey, a baby! What are you doing out here alone, baby? I'll take charge of you until your mommy shows up! Oh, you're just too cute.
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward. Thank Neptune you're here. I found this baby all alone. But he wasn't really alone, he was with Plankton! And he's not a baby! It's Mr. Krabs! Plankton turned him into a baby so he could steal the Krabby Patty secret formula!  What do we do, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Hold it right there! Old people are out greatest natural resource! I salute you, elder citizenry!
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	I'm catching up with my knitting.
SpongeBob	Well, I.
SpongeBob	I can too last more than one day. I'll show him. Aw, barnacles!
SpongeBob	All yours, old friend.  Patrick, there is one more thing I want you to have.
SpongeBob	I'm home. I'm home! I'm home! I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home!  Brothers and sisters, wait for me!  Buzz buzz. Buzz buzz. Ok, I'm here!  Wait, I just got here. My jellyfish instincts tell me to go  that way.  Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.  This is the life.  Hey everybody, buzz buzz. Buzz to you. Buzz, buzz, nice current today. Hey, what's the buzz?  Hello, I'm JellyBob, and you are?  Uhh... nice to meet you.
SpongeBob	Hey everybody! I'm back! I think I'm getting the hang of this.  Patrick! What are you doing?
SpongeBob	Well, that's over. Back to jellyfish matters.  Mmm, jelly.  Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning.  Greetings, comrades!  Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz.  Buzz.  Buzz.  Hey! Eww, I'm itchy! Itchy, why am I so itchy! Ahhhhh!  Poison sea urchins!  Ow, ow, oh, itches. Ow, ow, itches.  Buzz. Buzz. Buzz.  Krabby Patties.  Sandy.  What have I done? I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up.
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, captain!
SpongeBob	Order up right now! Go out there, and bless the taste buds of your lucky connoisseur
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	Squidward! The Krusty clientle needs to be cuddled and treated with respect.  There there.  Mr. Krabs will be ashamed!
SpongeBob	Chef exchange program?
SpongeBob	A Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry but I've got to go.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Hurry Patrick, hurry!  How's it look, buddy? Ready for the old scrapbook?
SpongeBob	No, it is the very nature of the fragile bubble.
SpongeBob	...To blow a bubble...
SpongeBob	Huh?  What have I done!?  We're never gonna get out of here!
SpongeBob	We were just...
SpongeBob	Why is this bubble painted on the murel?
SpongeBob	Ah, so this is what luxury feels like.
SpongeBob	Ring for the king, huh?
SpongeBob	Patrick, ssh!
SpongeBob	Hey cool.
SpongeBob	Quite.
SpongeBob	Whoa!
SpongeBob	There it is Patrick!
SpongeBob	Whoo, that was a close one buddy!
SpongeBob	Patrick did you hear something?
SpongeBob	We have to go home now!
SpongeBob	That tickles!
SpongeBob	So long. And thanks for the tour.
SpongeBob	Soon I'll see the Krusty Krab. Where I'm happily employed!
SpongeBob	Good-bye, Atlantis. We're Bikini Bottom bound!
SpongeBob	We're on our way!
SpongeBob	I can't wait to get home.
SpongeBob	I even love the sound!
SpongeBob	Now, if you'll excuse me, Gary, I must go make myself picturesque.  Perfect! I'm ready. Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob	Ketchup?
SpongeBob	And now, as an extra precaution to keep me looking shiny and new...  No grime can penetrate the glossy sheen  of Sponge Gloss.  There it is. So close, and still so shiny.  Hey, it's just a splash of water.  Stamps? all over me!  Oatmeal?  Glue.
SpongeBob	Ew!
SpongeBob	No, no, no, no, no, Patrick! I'm not jelly, I'm not jelly!
SpongeBob	Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese!
SpongeBob	I think I can explain.  Yes, I've seen this one before. It's a common symptom. Patrick is suffering from Krabby Patty Withdrawal. He needs one, or he'll keep mumbling about it for the next 3-1/2 minutes.
SpongeBob	Patrick, that's not a...  trash bag.
SpongeBob	Why should we?
SpongeBob	"I may get beaten to a quivering pulp but I must do it, for the sake of my parents.  Oh, my gosh, what happened to my parents' house? What's this? ""Do not cross?"" Is that police tape? There's only one reason for the police being here: a crime has been committed. No! Get it together, SquarePants. To face Blackjack, you've got to be as tough as nails.  Huh? What?! All the furniture is covered in plastic. The police must have covered everything to preserve the crime scene. What could have happened here?  What's this? Blackjack smashed my family portrait. Oh, no. What has he done with my parents?"
SpongeBob	But where's Blackjack?
SpongeBob	I need you to help me rescue my parents.
SpongeBob	Uncle Cap'N Blue, Uncle Cap'N Blue? Please help me.
SpongeBob	That's why we have to rescue them now!
SpongeBob	Nice wormy, nice wormy. Nice wormy.
SpongeBob	Party?
SpongeBob	To quiver.
SpongeBob	Yeah, Blackjack, you haven't changed a bit.
SpongeBob	So, we meet again, Crazyfish.
SpongeBob	Sorry, I'm not wearing any frosting.  Hey, that's cheating.
SpongeBob	Is too...
SpongeBob	No, no, Tuesday night was the one with the 30-foot librarian. Last night was the one where I defeat notorious arch- villain Jack M. Crazyfish. Using the sheer force of my awesomely developed musculature.  Whew, what a relief. For a second there I thought I gave myself a black...  ...eye.
SpongeBob	You promise you won't laugh?  Ok, here goes.  Gary, I gave myself a black eye trying to open the toothpaste.  Thanks for not laughing, Gere. I knew you'd...  Gere...?
SpongeBob	He was big and mean. Oh, but ol' SpongeBob here knows how to teach a lummox some manners.
SpongeBob	I woke up... Oh, I mean, I...
SpongeBob	Hi, Sandy.
SpongeBob	No, I engraved it on his pain gland.
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah, that's right. I had miscalculated the trajectory of my cup and the straw jabbed me in the eye, giving me this awful shiner.
SpongeBob	That's right.
SpongeBob	Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants? Well, I'll tell you who.  It was a peaceful morning in Bikini Bottom. I emerged from my fruit-shaped bungalow fresh as a bee when a wanted cry of distress pounded against my eardrum.
SpongeBob	I kind of thought it was teal but that sounds like him all right. Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat?  He's... real.
SpongeBob	One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, mi lord. Served directly to your waiting  Head and neck area. Sir, please, I am so sorry.
SpongeBob	Yeah, but it's  worth it when you get to work in these.
SpongeBob	Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, please. And I'm kind of in a hurry.  Doot, do, doot-do, doot...  Oh, my gosh. You guys live in a dump! But we don't have time for that right now. We gotta get you back to the Krusty Krab for your special appearance. I'll take ya.  Wow! I haven't seen you do the Spine Blaster since...  ...since episode 647.  When you blasted that guy's spine.  You still got it.
SpongeBob	The Chum Bucket?!! Plankton must be behind this.
SpongeBob	It doesn't make sense.  They should have been cured once the pureness of the Krabby Patties entered their... That's it! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are elderly. Their poor aging tummies must be having a hard time digesting the food. I know just what to do!
SpongeBob	Well Patrick, I guess...  I did.
SpongeBob	How about now?
SpongeBob	I had always preferred to recycle.
SpongeBob	Yeah. I could use a nap.
SpongeBob	This is a pretty fun camp game, huh Patrick?
SpongeBob	That's it! We'll show him we can be self-starters!
SpongeBob	It's a play, for our amusement, and inspiration!
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Uh... Hey guys! What are you doing?
SpongeBob	And he's going to eat us!
SpongeBob	We'll have you know that just the other day Squidward commented at our survival skills!  The Other Day
SpongeBob	No Patrick! No!  Sandy wait! Sandy! Sandy! Well, at least we have food, shelter, and water. I'll fix the tent while you start the campfire. Then when we're all done, I'll cook us some grub. Okay Patrick, we're almost done. We have fresh water, a rugged tent for shelter...
SpongeBob	Okay. Here's the plan..
SpongeBob	Sorry, sorry, take your time.
SpongeBob	I like it here. It's rooooooomy, and best of all, we have this cave all to ourselves.
SpongeBob	We'll be here forever? We're doomed!
SpongeBob	Patrick? Do'h! Patrick is my best friend! He wouldn't hurt me.
SpongeBob	Sounds like you're hungry.
SpongeBob	Yyyess! Yyeess! I shall eat Patrick before he eats meee!
SpongeBob	Oh no you don't!  Where'd he go? Come on out, Patrick. You can't hide forever! What's this?  Warm water?
SpongeBob	Why don't you take a nap on this nice, soft bed?  There, that's it. Here, I'll tuck you in with this nice soft blanket , and what's a little blanket without a little ketchup?
SpongeBob	Gotcha!
SpongeBob	Wow! It's great that we've won our medals, but I'm still hungry.
SpongeBob	You mean with a smile? Yes, sir!
SpongeBob	Wow, Patrick. I didn't know you had a famous relative.
SpongeBob	Gosh, I don't have anyone famous in my family.
SpongeBob	Do you have any famous relatives, Sandy?
SpongeBob	Gasp!
SpongeBob	Wait a minute,
SpongeBob	I've got a lot to live up to. Maybe one day people will know the name SpongeBob SquarePants!
SpongeBob	Squidward! You need bed rest!  I'll keep you safe until you're well again.
SpongeBob	Oh, a game.
SpongeBob	Gary! It's Opposite Day and I...  ...walk, don't run. And I'm gonna... opposite... opposite... I'm just gonna crawl into bed and do nothing all day.  Too bad it only comes once a year, huh Gary?
SpongeBob	Patrick... go away! I never want to see you again!
SpongeBob	Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite.
SpongeBob	Kcirtap yeh.
SpongeBob	Hello, Squidward! Oops. I mean, goodbye, Squidward! Aww, isn't Opposite Day...  ...terrible?
SpongeBob	I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard,  but that really means he's messing it up.  But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means,  Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob!  A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being...  Squidward!
SpongeBob	You're quite welcome, Mr. Squidward.
SpongeBob	Positive things! Opposite Day...  I'd love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft.
SpongeBob	I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward.
SpongeBob	I hear you loud and clear.
SpongeBob	Breaker, breaker outer perimeter, looks clear. Over.
SpongeBob	Please reply.
SpongeBob	Is he still after us, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Patrick, look! There's a weird thing sticking out of the ground right there.
SpongeBob	Phew! Nothing like a little manual labor to put some hair on your chest, eh, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Gimme that wheel!
SpongeBob	I like Squidward.
SpongeBob	I don't know, Patrick. Mr. Krabs said if we didn't find customers, not to come back.  Are you sure you don't want to be out first customer, sir.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Won't Mr. Krabs be so proud of us when he finds out how good we're doing. See any new customers, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Look, Patrick! We've floated back up, out of the deep, dark, depressing, horrible abyss!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	But not just a sandwich. It's a...Chum-Wich.
SpongeBob	We're back, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	But on the bright side, we did manage to bring back 37,000 pounds of these decorative deep sea rocks!
SpongeBob	I believe you can. My best friend and I would like to purchase...  Patrick, why are you crying?
SpongeBob	We gotta ditch these outfits! They're sending out the wrong signals!
SpongeBob	Wow! I like that guy. Excuse me, mister, but where did you and your friends buy your matching outfits?
SpongeBob	Echhh!!
SpongeBob	Thank you.  Eh, frankly, yes, Patrick, it does bother me.
SpongeBob	But being clean is so much better.
SpongeBob	Fine, if that's the way it is, then  I am taking the other side!
SpongeBob	Eww, brain juice!
SpongeBob	Satisfied?
SpongeBob	You, sir, could use some dental hygiene!
SpongeBob	Oh, booger, schmooger, you don't even have a nose.
SpongeBob	A Krabby Patty? What are you gotta do, eat it?
SpongeBob	Ergggg, YOU STOP THAT RIGHT NOW!!!!
SpongeBob	It's too late for that!
SpongeBob	I'll have to disinfect my eyeballs!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, thank you.
SpongeBob	And what is that, my son?
SpongeBob	Isn't life great, Gary? Oh, what a beautiful day. I have the best friends...
SpongeBob	I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
SpongeBob	Oh, that's the first time someone's called me that. Wait, I know who will enjoy my company.
SpongeBob	Let me explain. You see... I was passing by the tree, and I thought it'd be funny if I gave you a surprise.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs, are you OK?
SpongeBob	Yeah, just a bit of a headache, Sand-  Hey, I remember this place.
SpongeBob	Looks like I'm back in Bikini Bottom forever.
SpongeBob	You can say that again!
SpongeBob	No! don't tell me! I can't take it!
SpongeBob	Good morning Nurse Rechid.  Hi, Mabel. Saved the blue one just for you.
SpongeBob	It has been two weeks already? . Don't worry doc. I promise to stay out of the way.
SpongeBob	Very well, doctor. Carry on.
SpongeBob	Wait!
SpongeBob	Great Neptune...
SpongeBob	Gee, Squidward. People really seem to be noticing how handsome you are now. You might even be more handsome than before.
SpongeBob	Hmmm... I know just what to do.
SpongeBob	Just remember Squidward, this is going to hurt me more that it's going to hurt you.
SpongeBob	I know Squidward! I'll think of something! Huh! I just need, I just need...
SpongeBob	You're back! Oh, Squidward...I love you no matter how many times we smash your face.
SpongeBob	I gotta call for some help.  My fingers are too big for the buttons.
SpongeBob	They're attracted to my whistley holes.
SpongeBob	La la la la laaaaaaa... la la la la!
SpongeBob	Yeah, that's right.
SpongeBob	Uh, 4 days.
SpongeBob	Whoa, sorry. I was just wondering-
SpongeBob	Patrick, that bag is totally empty.
SpongeBob	Nooooooo!
SpongeBob	La la la la la la la la laaaaaaaa! Really neat.
SpongeBob	Don't forget the spatula!
SpongeBob	So what brings you to Bikini Bottom, Stanley?
SpongeBob	Stanley! You OK in there Stanley?
SpongeBob	Oh, that's okay. There's nothing good on TV anyway.  Nothing...
SpongeBob	Oh, Stanley. You just haven't found your purpose in life, that's all!
SpongeBob	This is my cousin, Stanley SquarePants. I thought you could teach him how to be a scientist.
SpongeBob	See? Isn't he amazing?
SpongeBob	Good, then why don't you come with me to work. Maybe seeing me totally fulfilled with cheer you up.
SpongeBob	Yes sir.
SpongeBob	Well, Stanley. Thanks to you, I'm on probation. If you wanna keep this job, you have to work hard!  Woo! Customer at the port bow! Man your stations! Man your stations! Ready for duty!
SpongeBob	About my cousin Stanley?
SpongeBob	Stanley, I cannot keep covering for you!  No! Not my spatula! My spatula...  The thing I hold nearest and dearest to my heart...
SpongeBob	Umm... What day is it?
SpongeBob	Mucho comprendo, Seor Habanero!
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	Roger!  Okay, Squidward, found the vacuum! Squidward? Well, I'll just vacuum for him. Hmm, Squidward's house is really messy. I'm going to need some extra power.
SpongeBob	Oh, don't worry Squilliam, I might be able to get Squidward to help redecorate your house. He is a personal friend of mine. You know success hasn't gone to his head? He is still the same old great guy, he has not changed.
SpongeBob	Nyah-Nyah-Nyah
SpongeBob	Thanks, Plankton.  Mr. Krabs makes me censor out all the patty ingredients from my lyrics.
SpongeBob	Oh, but you can't fool me! Not when you got an awesome guitar like that! And only a true rocker would have hair as greasy and nasty as yours. It'll be so cool! We could write songs together!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I've got big news!
SpongeBob	Plankton just asked me to join his Rock-N-Roll band!  Can Patrick join our band?
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward
SpongeBob	You know, Patrick, being in a band gives you the liberty to dress with a little more Uh, how should I put this?
SpongeBob	Whoa-ho-ho, I stand corrected!
SpongeBob	Oh man, Squidward's not gonna want to miss this.
SpongeBob	Hey, Plankton, what's that?
SpongeBob	Hey, Plankton, can our first song go like this?  And then turn into one of those songs that goes
SpongeBob	Is that what you mean, Plankton?
SpongeBob	Time to feed him. Time to feed him. Now it's Gary's feeding time. Mrow mrow meow, mrow mrow meow.
SpongeBob	Uh-huh, but Old Man Krabs doesn't want us bugging the customers. So, we have to go in after hours when nobody's there.
SpongeBob	We're on our way to our first gig. We're in a band.
SpongeBob	Sure thing, officer.  They're gone.
SpongeBob	All right! Squidward, are you ready?
SpongeBob	There's no time to waste, Plankton.  We've only got 22 years to practice before our next gig. A one and a two
SpongeBob	Yae-yes!
SpongeBob	I already am sharing it with you, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Whoa! Hello again Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Well, I thought I did.
SpongeBob	Nuh-uh.
SpongeBob	Well, I...
SpongeBob	Squidward, these deafening construction sounds are preventing me from working.
SpongeBob	Hey, Mr. Krabs, you made your own movie theater!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, can I see the movie now? Please?
SpongeBob	Squidward? You look beautiful!
SpongeBob	I would like to donate a penny.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, that wasn't a penny.
SpongeBob	Aye aye sir! Welcome aboard, sir! Here at the Krusty Krab,  are the captain, and I am your cabin boy. You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig! May I take your order?
SpongeBob	Hoppin' clams! A talent show! I'm talented! I'd better call my folks!
SpongeBob	Ta-da!
SpongeBob	I gotta get ready!
SpongeBob	Oh, yes!
SpongeBob	Squidward, should I use Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean?
SpongeBob	Wow, the Boating Museum! Maybe tomorrow if I can impress Mrs. Puff with an extensive knowledge of boating history, she'll give me a boating license on the spot!  See you tomorrow, Mrs. P.!
SpongeBob	Wait!
SpongeBob	I made this for you.
SpongeBob	Do you know how many rowers it takes to propel a trireme?
SpongeBob	Actually, it gets taken to port once a year for maintenance.
SpongeBob	Why, I bet they reel in up to 50 clams a day.
SpongeBob	...named after the captain's strict diet of scallions, of which the crew complained and the captain's  odor strongly resembled.  For four years this brigantine explored distant lands discovering places unknown to anyone besides the people who already lived there.  You ready to give me that license yet, Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	Yes maam.
SpongeBob	I think Plankton wants to destroy our way of life.
SpongeBob	Yay!  Whoo! Isn't this a boat load of fun, Squidward? I can't wait to see the poor sucker who has to go against that beast!
SpongeBob	No time for chit chat, get in!  Hurry up Nelly!
SpongeBob	My pleasure captain!
SpongeBob	You've really made him happy.
SpongeBob	Are you sure you don't want any help, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, I think you should see a doctor.
SpongeBob	Oh no! No, no, no, no, no! My patient is very sick!
SpongeBob	I'm not trying to do anything. I'm just having a decent morning.
SpongeBob	I'm not normal?  Squidward?  How does one become normal?
SpongeBob	Normaaaality.
SpongeBob	Hi, how are ya.
SpongeBob	Yup.
SpongeBob	Yes, sir. I'll do it... normally.
SpongeBob	Wonderful weather we're having.
SpongeBob	Maybe this thing is out of ink.
SpongeBob	Oh, I got normal.
SpongeBob	Ok, see ya 'round.  Hi, how are ya.
SpongeBob	And you know what else is abnormal? Your noseit's all bulbous and flappy. Your eyes are a little odd, too. Looks like your whole face could use some work. Yeah, there we go.  See? Looking normal already.
SpongeBob	That's very nice, Patrick, but I need you to retrain me. I want to be abnormal again.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm feeling very self-conscious right now.
SpongeBob	I don't know. I guess I became permanently normal.
SpongeBob	Wow, I guess Squidward's normal looks scared me back to my original form. Thanks, buddy, you saved my life.
SpongeBob	Who, Boaty?  Oh no. He's... Really?
SpongeBob	You're all still alive? Well where did you go?
SpongeBob	You too, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Wow. A whole day dedicated to me.
SpongeBob	"Freshness, check. Buns, check.  Fresh patties.  Check.  Oh, silly me, I'm forgetting one more minor detail.  Oh, yeah. Is it getting hot in here?  Or is it just you?  Ah!  ""Two Krabby Patties. P.S., SpongeBob, you're an idiot. Love, Squidward."" Aw, love you, too, Squiddy. Two Krabby Patties, coming right up!  Whoa!  Hmm.  Whew, this thing is stuck pretty good.  Whoa!  I guess this is it.  Oh, you really saved me!  Whooooaaaa! Hey, a splinter. Okay, well, it's been nice knowing you but you have got to go. Now. Okay, out we go.  Oh, that kinda hurts. Come on. Ooh, that really hurts. Oh, barnacles, this hurts! Conch-shelled manatees, this is painful!   Okay, you're tough, you're smart, and you're charming, but you are still no match for me! Look! A bald eagle with a mustache!  Okay, fine, stay. But I hope you like making Krabby Patties."
SpongeBob	Yes?
SpongeBob	Know what?
SpongeBob	This! Well, you see, this got stuck up there  so I stacked stuff and I climbed up to reach it. I reached the grip  and I got it but then I fell and I screamed! I was sure I was dead but then I wasn't but then I tripped and I got this splinter... Squidward? Squidward, were you listening at all?  I got this really bad splinter, you see?  And I couldn't hold the spatula with my hand so I used my nose.  Makes sense now, huh?
SpongeBob	I know, it hurts so bad.
SpongeBob	H-h-h-h-home? But I'm fine!
SpongeBob	But, but, but, Squidward, I'm fine!  I'm fine! I'm OK! Look at me, nothing's wrong! See? See?  See? See?
SpongeBob	Wew.
SpongeBob	Thank goodness you're there. I got a splinter on my thumb and...
SpongeBob	Patrick?
SpongeBob	Patrick, you didn't go to med school.
SpongeBob	Phew, thanks, Patrick, you're a lifesaver.  Ow!
SpongeBob	You mean this?
SpongeBob	Yes.
SpongeBob	Squidward, slide whistling is more than just simply tooting on an instrument! It's a way of life! Let's show him Patrick.
SpongeBob	Look Patrick! Squidward is finally playing along.
SpongeBob	Yes my friend. You got... the goods!
SpongeBob	Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
SpongeBob	Up ahead!!!
SpongeBob	This is how to live, isn't it my friend?
SpongeBob	Hey Patrick, where you going?
SpongeBob	Uh, Patrick, where are we going?
SpongeBob	No Patrick, I mean your life. I'm not going.
SpongeBob	Oh it's okay buddy, I think you learned your lesson. Hmm?
SpongeBob	By the way, what did he do that made you all so cranky?
SpongeBob	Yeah, yeah, you said it buddy! Now we're really living like Larry!
SpongeBob	Whooooo!!! Whoohooooo!!! Whoowoowoo!!!
SpongeBob	Rotten eggs?
SpongeBob	It seems to be stuck.
SpongeBob	In fact,  it's time for another coat.
SpongeBob	My turn!  Remember Patrick, 15 seconds exactly.
SpongeBob	Well Patrick, how do I look?
SpongeBob	I'll ask Squidward, he's always so helpful. He'll know what to do.  Hi Squidward.
SpongeBob	"I look... AMAZING. Time to go to the party!  Oh what a cute ""wittle"" baby. Cootchie-cootchie-coo."
SpongeBob	No, really Patrick, what are you...  Uh, I fell sticky.
SpongeBob	Can I get a little help here?
SpongeBob	And SpongeBob!
SpongeBob	Thank you Patrick. You know my shoes feel kinda tight.  Huh, nice and roomy.
SpongeBob	Hey Gary, that shell of yours looks a little cramped.
SpongeBob	"Now, Patrick!  There you go Mr. Krabs. You always wanted to make ""big money"".  Good deed accomplished! I ask for no reward."
SpongeBob	Are you sure?
SpongeBob	That didn't work.
SpongeBob	And a giant.
SpongeBob	This is really fun.
SpongeBob	Even though you really wanted to.
SpongeBob	Oh Patrick, this is terrible! Squidward did not like the kindness we did him.
SpongeBob	We used your kelp to make a kelp-mch clarinet.
SpongeBob	Plankton! It's you!
SpongeBob	I'll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn't be such a meanie.
SpongeBob	Play with me.
SpongeBob	Great!  Last one to the fields is a rotten clam!  So, I get the big net and you get the little net.
SpongeBob	It's not about winning, it's about fun!
SpongeBob	Plankton! Those things aren't what fun is all about. Now, do it like this: F is for friends who do stuff to-
SpongeBob	Okay!
SpongeBob	Plankton-buddy! Lets go! I forgot this is a no friend zone!
SpongeBob	We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs!  Come on Plankton, let's get out of here.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	How can you not see it??
SpongeBob	What?!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed.
SpongeBob	Patrick, that's not a nose that's a...  ...hermit crab.
SpongeBob	All right Patrick, let's unveal the new shanauze!
SpongeBob	1, 2, 3, 4  Come on SquarePants, be a man!
SpongeBob	Come on SpongeBob, be a man!  Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Yes sir!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, there aren't any chairs.
SpongeBob	Could you repeat that?
SpongeBob	Uh, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs trusted me, and I let him down!
SpongeBob	Not that kind of help. This used to have the Krabby Patty secret ingredient inside. But now, it's missing!
SpongeBob	Aha! I knew it was you!
SpongeBob	All right, no more jokes! Either you tell me where the secret ingredient is, or we'll be forced to use other means of making you talk!
SpongeBob	Mm-hmm.
SpongeBob	Only someone who specializes in science, could reverse engineer the recipe, based on the secret ingredient. Hmm, a scientist.  There she is.  You hang back. I'm going in for a closer look.  Oh, my gosh! It is Sandy!  Enjoying them Krabby Patties lady?
SpongeBob	What I am getting at, is that you...  ...cloaked yourself  an invisibility potion, snuck through the security perimeter...
SpongeBob	My own house, huh?  Why'd you do it, Gary?!
SpongeBob	What's that, Gary?
SpongeBob	Gotcha! You thought you could hide your crimes.
SpongeBob	I guess this means you didn't steal the secret ingredient.
SpongeBob	All I know is that it had to be someone who knew about the delivery, and was at the Krusty Krab during the delivery, and this person would have to know what to do with the secret ingredient when he got it.
SpongeBob	Step right up, and get your free Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob	Barnacles!  There he is. Just in time for breakfast.  Oh, I am such a clumsy oath. I sure hope nothing happens to this Krabby Patty as I step carefully over this rock here.  Oh, no! Too late! No! No!  Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Come on, Nat. Just one flaxin gentle bite! I see you're not hungry right now, but I'm telling you, that Krabby Patty will make a great snack later.
SpongeBob	Why don't be ridiculous my husband, bleep blap. Of course it's me.
SpongeBob	I guess you'll have to make Chum just like Plankton's.
SpongeBob	97, 98, 99, 100. Okay, Gary, let's do the other side now. Gary, can you hear that?  Oh Squidward, it's you. I thought I heard something.
SpongeBob	I have it, Squidward, you gave it to me to leave you alone yesterday.  Squidward, you can have the $5 back. Mr. Krabs says--
SpongeBob	Squidward! Squidward!
SpongeBob	You left your keys on the table back there.  Hey, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Okay, I'll see you later then, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Don't worry Squidward, we're boating buddies now! I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can.
SpongeBob	Well, first, I started over here. And then I went way over here. Do-do-do-do, like that. Then, I went around like this, and over here like that, and across this lane, and down here like this, and then  and then I went around, and stopped right here.
SpongeBob	Squidward, do you have any mustard in there?
SpongeBob	Hey, where'd Squidward go?
SpongeBob	You said you didn't need my help, Squidward, and that you didn't need me.
SpongeBob	Don't worry Squidward, I've never gotten one answer right on this test.  But we'll meet again next week, at Mrs. Puff's boating school!
SpongeBob	Oooh, let me see there was... none.
SpongeBob	On the thirst for a juicy story, eh? Hmm, but what kind of story is juicy enough to quench their dry news gullets? I don't even know where to begin to look.  No news to report here. Stop the presses, it's Patrick! And he appears to be waiting for the bus! This is the kind of breaking story my readers are waiting for!  Patrick Star, I'm scoop SquarePants from the . Everyone's wondering, what bus are you taking today?
SpongeBob	Imagination!
SpongeBob	Yeah, but that isn't the story I wrote.
SpongeBob	Hello, Larry.
SpongeBob	That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, sir. I don't think these stories are doing anyone any good.
SpongeBob	Yes, Mr. Krabs,you could say that.
SpongeBob	Aye-aye, sir.
SpongeBob	Gee Mr. Krabs, I've written about everybody in town. Any ideas, sir?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, are you okay?
SpongeBob	We can stay up really, really late! And tell ghost stories! And trade socks!
SpongeBob	Do I know any... no. But Gary does.
SpongeBob	Gosh, Mr. Krabs. I never knew you were scared of zombies.
SpongeBob	Oh, I do, Mr. Krabs. It must be horrible to invite people into your home and have them treat your property with so little respect!
SpongeBob	I dont know, but she is ug-ly! Now to put on that disguise I told you about.  Ta-daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrgh! Huh? Huh? Huh?
SpongeBob	Your dad sent it. Its already paid for.
SpongeBob	I wanted to come with you, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, its working!
SpongeBob	Its me, SpongeBob SquarePants. Can we talk, Pearl? Whale to sponge?
SpongeBob	Yeesh, I only asked for one.
SpongeBob	I only need eight!
SpongeBob	Ooh, Mr. Krabs' root beer cellar.
SpongeBob	Who wants to dance?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I think I know whatll cheer you up.  A mug of ice cold root beer!
SpongeBob	Check. And last, but not least, a quick undercarriage check.  Whoa, okay, maybe we should skip that one. Let's see... Yep, that's about does it. A second, buddy. I'll carry your shell.
SpongeBob	I always use an old rope. I guess that's not good enough.
SpongeBob	Oh, don't be so protective of me, Gary. I know I've been an horrible parent. But no longer! From this moment on forth, I vow to give my Gary the utmost in empty frivolity! To live by the standards of snail grooming, set forth by: that guy!
SpongeBob	Hold still, Gary. Uhhhhhh! Come on, buddy!  Uhh! Uhh! There. Oh, you're like a little cuddly present.
SpongeBob	That's what I like to hear because I can bring this out. Your very own studded collar. With two rows of diamonds. Here, try it on. Now, let's get back out there and knock them out of their shells.
SpongeBob	This is it, Gary. This is our time to shine!  Wow, Patrick. There's a whole lot of pet loving going on here today.
SpongeBob	Hmm Maybe you needs some shades, eh, Gare?  Silly boy, you're not supposed to eat the leash.
SpongeBob	It's in the bag.
SpongeBob	You were trying to tell me that all along Weren't you, Gary?
SpongeBob	It's a good thing that new ceiling fan Mr. Krabs installed is still working.
SpongeBob	I was wearing shoes. They... It's so hot they melted off.
SpongeBob	Oh, that noise was Sandy.
SpongeBob	Patrick! Look out!
SpongeBob	Island?
SpongeBob	Why do they call you Twitch?
SpongeBob	Well, it's been fun hanging out with you guys, but Mr. Krabs didn't give us the day off. So we gotta get back to Goo Lagoon.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick! Wanna see something cool?
SpongeBob	Who?
SpongeBob	Could you pull over here? I gotta tie my shoe.
SpongeBob	You've got to stop judging people by the way they look.
SpongeBob	Will you teach us how to surf, O great one, so we may get back home?
SpongeBob	Quiet, Squidward! I think we're about to receive another lesson.
SpongeBob	He said we just have to stare into this fire all night, and the secrets will be revealed.
SpongeBob	JKL! Is this the next part of our training?
SpongeBob	Well, JKL, I guess this is good-bye.
SpongeBob	Patrick, grab on!

SpongeBob	Anything else?
SpongeBob	A Promotion. Congratulations, Squidward!
SpongeBob	But....

SpongeBob	I made it! And a minute before the final bell. I am home free.  Mrs. Puff. I'm really sorry. Please forgive me. I don't know what happened. Everything just got away from me.  I brought back your bathroom key, though.
SpongeBob	Why don't we just make the Krusty Krab look like a pirate ship.
SpongeBob	Um...
SpongeBob	Woo-hoo!
SpongeBob	It's Squidward!
SpongeBob	Yeah! Way to go!
SpongeBob	Maybe he got to join the lodge!
SpongeBob	You still have your robes.
SpongeBob	No, it wasn't your fault, Patrick.
SpongeBob	That's it!  Squidward! We'll make our own club! And it'll be so much better than that dumb old Cephalop-olaphapa Lodge! And you can be our leader! How great does that sound, O Mighty One?! Wanna join our club, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Patrick and I have come up with a secret hand-shake.
SpongeBob	Let's move.
SpongeBob	A very special initiation.
SpongeBob	They sure aren't. They're your uniform for your new lodge! Welcome to the first official meeting of...The Feather Friends.
SpongeBob	Aw...Squidward, I hadn't realized how special your lodge was to you. I'll get you back in that club. And I know just how to do it.  Everything we need is in this drawer.
SpongeBob	Roar!
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squidward. We still have the Feather Friends.
SpongeBob	Yeah, me neither. Just gonna be hangin' at 'Casa de Esponja'. Feel free to drop by if you're in the neighborhood.  .

SpongeBob	What if I got a couple of throw pillows?
SpongeBob	That's it!
SpongeBob	Dear Squidward, Thanks For lending me your vacuum cleaner! Sincerely, SpongeBob SquarePants. ... Oh, P.S.
SpongeBob	I didn't steal it, silly, I borrowed it.
SpongeBob	Squidward! I've been expecting you! Welcome to my humble abode! I hope that you will find comfort. And please don't hesitate to ask me if there's anything I can...
SpongeBob	Hot hors d'oeuvres?
SpongeBob	Yes, of course.  Please take a seat while I go grab your vacuum.  Please make yourself at home!  Enjoying your visit so far, Squidwar...?
SpongeBob	Then okay! Make yourself at home! Squidward sure seems to be enjoying his visit.
SpongeBob	So, are you enjoying your stay at 'Chez Spong?'
SpongeBob	Squidward? You okay? Squidward?
SpongeBob	Now to finish the day's chores.  Hello?
SpongeBob	Gary, go check on the laundry in the dryer.
SpongeBob	It's me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Well, maybe these pictures of us together will job your memory.  Me and you at my birthday party.  Me and you at work.  That little slumber party we had last week.  I forgot when this was taken.
SpongeBob	Patrick, what are you doing in my house?
SpongeBob	I'm filling out an application.
SpongeBob	You've worked here a long time. Why don't you show this rookie the ropes?
SpongeBob	Shouldn't you watch it?
SpongeBob	Going fine.  Oh, Mr. Squidward...  Whatcha reading?  Bathroom break. Check.
SpongeBob	Oh I think you've had way too many of those.
SpongeBob	I can't be SpongeBob SquarePants with round pants.
SpongeBob	Don't they look peaceful?
SpongeBob	Hey, It came back!
SpongeBob	I've got it!
SpongeBob	Oh! I almost forgot!
SpongeBob	Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... Patrick and I can do it Mermaid Man!!!
SpongeBob	We're ready! Man Bob!
SpongeBob	What's your favorite thing about shuffle boarding?
SpongeBob	We already won the tournament.
SpongeBob	Ohhh! Patrick! Stop! We can't. We have to get the costumes back.
SpongeBob	Patrick! Don't you think that's too harsh?
SpongeBob	You're right Patboy! This town needs us!
SpongeBob	Uuhhhhhh! That's the evil Man Ray!
SpongeBob	I'll bet he's handing off some secret weapon! Time to crash this party!
SpongeBob	Playing dumb ay?
SpongeBob	Not so fast Man Ray!
SpongeBob	Well, our work is done here.
SpongeBob	They have so many fans!
SpongeBob	Sure! Patrick's New Year's resolution was to learn to play an instrument!
SpongeBob	Alright, it was me.
SpongeBob	Hey, my mom has one of those in her garden!
SpongeBob	Well, I guess if I was to say one thing, it would have to be: We're sorry, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Now what?
SpongeBob	Uhh, Patrick? I think something's wrong with Squidward. He looks unconscious.
SpongeBob	Do you think he'll be okay?
SpongeBob	We're almost there. We can do this.
SpongeBob	No, stay back!
SpongeBob	We'll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us!
SpongeBob	Here?
SpongeBob	Only the freshest, o spooky one.  A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness.  A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness.
SpongeBob	Flank steak.
SpongeBob	Patrick, are you ready for this?
SpongeBob	Here.
SpongeBob	No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest.
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	I wrote Here lies Squidward. You may not remember him, but...  Oh, hi Squidward. Does this look deep enough?
SpongeBob	You're bald?
SpongeBob	As you wish, master.
SpongeBob	No, the other thing.
SpongeBob	I can't reach him!
SpongeBob	He's on the other side now.
SpongeBob	Hey! Maybe we can play a game with this ball that was buried under here!
SpongeBob	Yeah. Hey! Why don't we invite Mr. Wormsley to stay at my place? At least until his nest grows back.
SpongeBob	That's right, say hello to Mr. Wormsley.
SpongeBob	All right Gary, so there isn't more upset, you're going to sleep at the guest newspaper tonight, while Mr. Wormsley is sleeping herewith me.  Now, now Gary don't be rude.  See I set it all nice just for you.There you are.  Good night Gary.
SpongeBob	Oh! Patrick its a miracle.
SpongeBob	He's chased her away! Now who will care for her abandoned newborn infants?
SpongeBob	Baby worms.
SpongeBob	Would you like a baby worm?
SpongeBob	Probably not.
SpongeBob	Okay. I was just gonna see if you wanted one of these poor, lonely baby worms.
SpongeBob	Larry, no!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. My pet worm had babies and got chased away. Now I've got to find them all a place to live.
SpongeBob	Well, okay.
SpongeBob	Enjoy your new home, little guy.
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward look! I figured out how to get my mop wet without dipping it in the bucket.
SpongeBob	Krabs give me secret formula or... uhhh... what was that other thing?
SpongeBob	You have a secret?
SpongeBob	I'm... in charge?
SpongeBob	Yep. And I'm in charge for the next 15 minutes.
SpongeBob	Heh-heh. Everything is under control, people. Go back to your krabby patties. Nothing your temporary man in charge can't handle.  Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squid? Squid? Squidward? Squid? Squid?
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Order up, Squidward!
SpongeBob	What kind of secret?
SpongeBob	Hey, buddy. It's me, SpongeBob, fry cook extraordinaire.
SpongeBob	Betcha didn't think you'd be in here today, did ya?
SpongeBob	Taking out an order!
SpongeBob	Ooh!  It's here, it's here, it's here! Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo it's here!
SpongeBob	How?
SpongeBob	One Krusty Krab, covered in mud and slime!
SpongeBob	Ehh...
SpongeBob	Oh, can do, Squidward, can do!
SpongeBob	I was just following Squidward's advice, Mr. Krabs. He told me all your secrets!
SpongeBob	Sure! What's up?
SpongeBob	With Gary as my witness, I won't let you down, Mrs. Cheeks!  I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down!
SpongeBob	"""Telescope Assembly Manual""..."
SpongeBob	What am I gonna do?  You can do it. You made the commitments, you have to honor them. Both of them.
SpongeBob	What words?
SpongeBob	Oh, Neptune! This is worse than I ever could've imagined!  Right! Time to be all I can be!  Man, these people sure look sciencey. Sandy must be pulling out all the stops on this one.  Hey, Sandy! Watcha doing?
SpongeBob	I...
SpongeBob	Forget? How can I forget my best friend's birthday party?
SpongeBob	"""Sorry About the Scabies"". Um, can you change it to say ""Happy Birthday""?"
SpongeBob	Oh, I just thought I'd be a little festive, you know, for the scientists...
SpongeBob	Yeah, there was a, uhh... Big... Traffic... Storm.
SpongeBob	The cake! I must've left it at Sandy's!
SpongeBob	The telescope!
SpongeBob	Ugh! I left it at Patrick's rock!
SpongeBob	OK, I'll be right back!
SpongeBob	Aw. You know, you guys are right. It was silly to think I could be in 3 places at once.
SpongeBob	That's because this is my work hat, Patrick. I have to wear it when I go to work.
SpongeBob	What's shakin' Mr. K?
SpongeBob	He's nervous.
SpongeBob	That's buddy. Come on.
SpongeBob	Patrick? Patrick, are you all right? Say something!  OK, that's it! No best friend of mine is going to suffer permanent brain trauma just so Mr Krabs can make a quick buck. I'm going to go have a talk with him right -
SpongeBob	I'm worried about Patrick. I'm not sure his new job is good for him.
SpongeBob	Oh, I can't watch!
SpongeBob	It's OK, Patrick, not everyone is equipped to bear the awesome weight of responsibility that a uniform hat represents. But you can wear mine any time you want.
SpongeBob	Huh......Patrick
SpongeBob	Yo. Buried Treasure Board Game?
SpongeBob	Hey, we could play with our Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures! Ew. Barnacle Boy's all chewed up. And slimy.
SpongeBob	Welcome to Bikini Bottom's newest...  Toy store?!  Ahhhhh!
SpongeBob	Well, I guess it's not open yet.
SpongeBob	That depends. Tell me. Do you like to sing?!
SpongeBob	It's not a tutu! It's a man-tu! You can tell because it has  extra support.  I got the last one.
SpongeBob	Patrick, we have to leave.
SpongeBob	No. But I do now. What do we do first?!
SpongeBob	Patrick, is that you?
SpongeBob	How long have you had that?
SpongeBob	Yes.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	It was nice knowin' ya, pal.
SpongeBob	Get up Patrick! It's time!
SpongeBob	Uhhh... Sure. A little sunscreen and I'm sure you'll be fine!  I'm spending the whole day at the beach with my best friend.
SpongeBob	Okay, out of everybody on this bus, guess which one is my best friend?
SpongeBob	Look Patrick! We made it! Hey best friend? Check this out!  It's a small plastic disc that you throw!
SpongeBob	Ready?!
SpongeBob	No one's ever been annoyed by a sand castle.  Nothing quite like the joy of sand castling, eh, buddy?  How ya doing over there?
SpongeBob	Well I suppose I should just tend to the affairs of my own realm.  And I'll start by making a queen to rule by your side.
SpongeBob	So, you don't do that!!!  There! That restores the integrity of our shared border.
SpongeBob	"Oh is that so!?"" Well if you think you can take down this castle, my answer is"
SpongeBob	Uh huh... mmm hmm. Well put general! We'll create a surprise military diversion and break through enemy lines. What say you?  Yes! We'll ready ourselves immediately!  How do you like me now?
SpongeBob	Jumping jellyfish! WHOA!
SpongeBob	No, no, it wasn't. What started out as a fun dream turned into a horrible, brutal, nightmare. As the winds of time changed the silvery sands of these dunes to a new landscape, so let us hope that our own winds of change will change our spiritual dunes to a landscape of peace. Oh buddy, let's never forget this lesson.
SpongeBob	I can!
SpongeBob	I guess I go better take a look.
SpongeBob	What the heck is going on with my fancy boot?  HEY, KNOCK IT OFF!
SpongeBob	GARY!  Hooa!
SpongeBob	Oh no! You're in pain! Don't worry, I'll make it better.
SpongeBob	Yeah, your right, too gaudy.  No, too last season.  Well, I need that. A-haha, look Gary.  Here, try this on for size.
SpongeBob	Here it is Gary. Your neeew shell. . You look ready to ride.  Shell Spiffy. Great idea, Gair, I'll order you a new shell. Are there any you have your mind on, ol' buddy?
SpongeBob	Oh, sorry Angry Jack, eh Gary here needs a new shell, and we knew you would help us find one. Hey, shouldn't you be yelling at me right now?
SpongeBob	Oooohh, that's nice, love the pattern. We'll take it, but first I gotta make sure it's battened down. We don't want this one slippin' off hey, buddy?
SpongeBob	Good idea, angry.
SpongeBob	Why... can't... I... stop... break-ing... SHELLS!? AHHHH!
SpongeBob	You, er... sure you don't have any more in the back?
SpongeBob	Take it, it's all my savings.
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	Oh, what am I kidding, it looks terrible on you!
SpongeBob	I destroyed Gary's shell, and now I can't find a replacement. I guess he'll just spend the rest of his days as a lowly slug!
SpongeBob	Wait, Mr. Krabs! If you help me get Gary a shell, I'll, WORK FREE FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.
SpongeBob	There ya go, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	I'm on it. .
SpongeBob	Three.
SpongeBob	Ah! Goofy Goober is going non-dairy?
SpongeBob	Not so good, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Blegh, Aheh, Agh, Agheh
SpongeBob	Hold on! Did you hear that? It sounds like...
SpongeBob	Come on. Tell your Uncle SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	No, from the heart. That's where your love grows.
SpongeBob	Luh...vuh!
SpongeBob	...vvvv...
SpongeBob	So whats your favorite thing for you and, Karen to do together?
SpongeBob	"Interesting, does she ever go ""Ding!"""
SpongeBob	Repeat after me. Me me me me me me meeeee...
SpongeBob	This is it, Plankton.
SpongeBob	They're such a lovely couple.  The Krabby Patty Formula?!
SpongeBob	How do ya turn this thing off?!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	Oh hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you talking to that dummy I made? It's pretty realistic isn't it?  I made this part out of...
SpongeBob	What is it Gary? What do you have?  Hey Gary, this magazine gives me an idea!  Long.  Tan.  Handsome. Okay Gary, wait till Pearl gets an eyeful of this!
SpongeBob	Uh-uh-uh...  first prom picture.
SpongeBob	Prom expert; away!
SpongeBob	Whoa. But, I bet he isn't holder of the Regional Romance Dance Championship trophy!
SpongeBob	Don't cry, the prom expert is here! I haven't failed yet!  Hey, we can still... no, I broke that. We could... no. Don't cry! D-d-don't cry. Whatever you do, don't...
SpongeBob	All I wanted was to have a good time.
SpongeBob	Gee whiz, Pearl. I'm sorry tonight didn't go out like you planned.
SpongeBob	A little overboard? And take a chance at being late for the single most greatest day of my career.  The eleventy-seventh anniversary of the Krusty Krab.  Oh, oh, oh, I think not.  No self-respecting Krusty Krab employee would be late on this day.
SpongeBob	Sorry, everybody, but Mr. Krabs needs me.  Reporting for duty, sir.
SpongeBob	Y-Yes, Sir?
SpongeBob	I am?  Yay!  Yeah! Yeah!
SpongeBob	Do you come here often?
SpongeBob	Every word, Squidward, every word.
SpongeBob	Oh, no. Patrick, stand up!  We're locked in!  This is gonna spoil the eleventy-seventh anniversary.
SpongeBob	Hurry up, guys, this kind of hurts.
SpongeBob	Gary the snail, you get down from that this instant.
SpongeBob	I think that's us, Patrick.  But, who  are they?
SpongeBob	Follow me!
SpongeBob	Plankton,  you're trying to steal the Krabby Patty recipe again.
SpongeBob	You mean?
SpongeBob	It's beautiful.  I'll take it.   Hi, neighbor!  I'm SpongeBob SquarePants.  And we're going to be bestest friends.  Hey, Patrick. Guess, who just moved in right next door?
SpongeBob	Mm-hmm.
SpongeBob	Ready!
SpongeBob	I'm ready!
SpongeBob	And we didn't even get to celebrate The Krusty Krab's eleventy-seventh anniversary. We missed what could have been the greatest party ever!
SpongeBob	No. By using our heads.
SpongeBob	Oh, it was not for nothing, Squidward. I spent the whole day with my best friends.   You, Squidward.  And you Patrick.
SpongeBob	Oh, Krusty Krab, oh, Krusty Krab. Oh, how I love you, Krusty Krab. Your Krabby Patties from the grill.  The smell of grease gives me a thrill.  Oh, Krusty Krab, oh, Krusty Krab. Oh, how I love you, Krusty Krab.  With prices high  and your portions small.  There are stains of mustard on the wall.  Oh, Krusty Krab, oh, Krusty Krab. Oh, how I love you,  Krusty Krab.  Oh, Krusty Krab, oh, Krusty Krab.  Oh, how I love ya,  Krusty Krab.  Oh, Krusty Krab,  oh,  Krusty Krab.  Oh, how I  love you, Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	In that case, let's get some Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Um, Patrick? Don't you mean twice as fun?
SpongeBob	Here we go.
SpongeBob	Admire it later, Patrick. Right now, we got to get my house converted into a shelter capable of withstanding extreme weather.
SpongeBob	Whoo! Nice work, buddy. Now my house can withstand anything nature has to throw at us.
SpongeBob	C'mon Squidward, it'll be fun! While the elements rage outside, we'll snuggle in here and pass the time by playing board games, and playing tic-tac-toe, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and playing tic-tac-toe, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and watchin' TV, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and playin' board games, and drinkin' hot tea...
SpongeBob	Okay, but you better think fast. Because Patrick really likes my
SpongeBob	Squidward, the lights went out.
SpongeBob	Okay, boys, let's roll to see who goes first.
SpongeBob	Oh, it's a tie.
SpongeBob	Yeah, it looks like a lot of junk.
SpongeBob	Come on, Patrick. You can do it.
SpongeBob	Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, Go! Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, go!
SpongeBob	Squidward. It wasn't your turn. That's cheating.
SpongeBob	Please, Squidward?
SpongeBob	I have a question.
SpongeBob	If you're the one who drew it, let me see some identification papers.
SpongeBob	Stop that cephalopod!
SpongeBob	Your food?
SpongeBob	I don't hear anything.
SpongeBob	Wow, if only I was a little off.
SpongeBob	Patrick, isn't this place amazing?  Here are your Chum Nuggets, buddy.
SpongeBob	Yeah, baby! I've got cavern fever!
SpongeBob	Or, just pay me for the job I already do!
SpongeBob	"I'm not using my hands because today is ""Work Without Your Hands Day"".  You should give it a whirl, buddy.  Krusty Krab, SpongeBob speaking. Just a minute please. Mr. Krabs, it's a Queen Amphitrite. She wants to have King Neptune's birthday party here."
SpongeBob	Excuse me, Mr. Royal Sea Kingness, your table is this way,sir.
SpongeBob	No, not that chair, your Highness. That one, see? It even has its pretty name card that I made still on it.
SpongeBob	Stop, Squidward, please stop! Your descriptions are too horrifying for my delicate sensibilities.
SpongeBob	Now, all I've got to do is find King Neptune's long-lost son.
SpongeBob	Another one!  Plus some rope.
SpongeBob	For King Neptune's birthday!
SpongeBob	Well, thanks, but...
SpongeBob	Don't go.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, I'll stop talking, I swear
SpongeBob	Patrick?
SpongeBob	Wow, all ready, Patrick you know I'll never figure out how you do those so darn fast.
SpongeBob	Sure Triton, what do you need to use, the bathroom.
SpongeBob	But look, that mail hasn't been picked up today.
SpongeBob	Oh, this is terrible
SpongeBob	Make ready the disguise.
SpongeBob	Hurry up Patrick, he's getting bored
SpongeBob	I think now would be an excellent time, yes.
SpongeBob	Squidward's on TV?  Squidward! Squidward!  Squidward, you're on TV!  No, really, Squidward, come look!
SpongeBob	Ooh ooh! Whoo! Whoo! Let me do something too, please?!
SpongeBob	You seem tense.
SpongeBob	Oh-ho, I got music, friend...  ...in my mind!  Oh, I love this song!  Here I go!
SpongeBob	Really?  You like my dancin'?
SpongeBob	That's right!  So I gotta practice as much as I can before tomorrow.  Got a dance audition.
SpongeBob	Oh, what are you doing, Squidward?
SpongeBob	I'm back from Mount Oyster!  Here.  Got this for you at the gift shop
SpongeBob	Like this?
SpongeBob	Well, yes, but--
SpongeBob	Right, Squidward.  And a-one, and a-two, and a--  Nope.
SpongeBob	And a-one, and a-two, and a-oof!  Is that okay, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! How could you do this to me?
SpongeBob	I didn't know Mr. Krabs had a gold tooth.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, you're the owner of the most delightfully delicious restaurant in Bikini Bottom! Why don't you just take her there to eat?
SpongeBob	It was love, Mr. Krabs. It was love.
SpongeBob	Uhh, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Gee thanks, Patrick! now I'm stuck for- fe, fe, fe, forever?!  Patrick, I wanted to get un-stuck not more stuck! How am I going to get to work if I'm stuck here forever? Must get out of Wringer!
SpongeBob	"No. I'm won't let it get between me and those crisp onions, sweet tomatoes, fresh lettuce, a flame- broiled patty, a warm bun sprinkled with sesame seeds, served with a smile that says, ""Hey! I can!"" I'm ready!"
SpongeBob	Hardware store! No, from my bathroom.
SpongeBob	Ohh! A refill!
SpongeBob	Oh, an absolute disaster. I can't do anything without this stupid wringer getting in the way. Patrick, I am nothing more than a-- a bike rack. A sad, sad, sad, sad little bike rack.
SpongeBob	I don't know... I have too much eye pain.
SpongeBob	I said I don't want any!
SpongeBob	If it wasn't for your Forever Glue, I wouldn't be stuck in this thing!
SpongeBob	My favorite show.  Ha, ha, I love that part!
SpongeBob	Patrick! Your tears! They're melting the glue! Keep crying! I'll do the same and maybe I can slip out of this thing!  Look! It worked!
SpongeBob	Sandy! You're back!
SpongeBob	I got it! You're not wearing your spacesuit and helmet!
SpongeBob	Hohohoho. No can do, buddy. That would require revealing the secret formula. And that is explicitly forbidden as per my current labor contract.
SpongeBob	And we are guh-rillin'.
SpongeBob	Now that we're grillin', we can work on the fixin's! See, there are two patties here. But before we get into slicing and dicing we always start with the washing. We'll begin with the seaweed.
SpongeBob	Then lay it down onto the drying rack and we'll engage our drying phase, hmm.
SpongeBob	Steady, steady... Nice. Oh, you're off-center by 3.6 millimeters. Mmmph, try it again, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Eh, try again.
SpongeBob	Sandy, you're naked! And you don't have any clothes on!
SpongeBob	Hey, can somebody hit the lights?
SpongeBob	Oh, nuh-uh. Nuh, no. Ah, there you are, patty! Add one fluffy bun like so and a squirt of special sauce .
SpongeBob	Hey, the lights are back on.  Mr. Krabs! Help me, Mr. Krabs. I've forgotten how to make Krabby Patties. Please tell me the secret recipe again.
SpongeBob	Oh, it, uh-- you know, I don't remember. Me neither. So we good?
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
SpongeBob	What do you mean?
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!
SpongeBob	An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.
SpongeBob	Crystal, sir!
SpongeBob	That can be arranged.
SpongeBob	Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward, getting sleepy huh?
SpongeBob	All right, Squidward, I'll stop by after work!
SpongeBob	Truce.
SpongeBob	As soon as he stops shaking my hand...
SpongeBob	It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Comin' right up!
SpongeBob	Kinda looks like nobody has cleaned out the trap for awhile.
SpongeBob	Well Now we got the ol' grease trap cleaned out, what do you think we should do with all this excess grease?
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs, I'm not doing anything!
SpongeBob	Okay Mr. Krabs. I never turn the grill off but I can turn it off even less than that if you want.
SpongeBob	Sir yes sir!
SpongeBob	It was me sir. I just wanted to tell you that... Well, for the past two weeks, Plankton and Mr. Krabs have been...  they've been feeding people grea...
SpongeBob	Wait a minute. Did you say soaked up?
SpongeBob	Stop it! Stop it! Go away! No! No!
SpongeBob	I am.
SpongeBob	Oh, just seeing which one of us is the little guy...  ...and it looks like it  you!
SpongeBob	Goodbye, Krusty Krab. Goodbye, life as I know it.
SpongeBob	Oh, get it out of my sight! Now that I have no means of purchasing food for myself, I do not need a refrigerator.
SpongeBob	Good, Gary! There had to be some job openings in the classifieds.  Whoa! Although, these ads smell a little out of date. I better get some fresh ones.  Lawyer, no. Too much arguing. Stunt driver, don't have a boating license. Astronaut, don't like food in a bag. Oh, this one sounds interesting. . That shouldn't be too much of a stretch from fry cooking.  20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97.  Order up!   What do you think, boss?
SpongeBob	That's just a billboard, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Yeah, but...wait, isn't that the same thing?
SpongeBob	I did?
SpongeBob	How'd I do?
SpongeBob	"Oh, yes I did, Patrick.  I said, ""You're looking at the new face of television."""
SpongeBob	Ah, just as I was saying. I'd like to thank you for giving me my humble start. I won't forget you.
SpongeBob	Yippee!  I am ready for my close-up, Mr. Director.
SpongeBob	Nooo!  I can't do this!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!  Please let me back, please! I promise I'll do better.  Please.
SpongeBob	Good morning Squidward!
SpongeBob	Please let me help!
SpongeBob	Pretty please with candy sprinkles on top?
SpongeBob	Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! Thank you Squidward.
SpongeBob	No peeking.
SpongeBob	Squidward that... that's a beautiful thing to say!
SpongeBob	On top of your garbage.  The dump was closed.  So I bought it here.
SpongeBob	Oh a statue eh? Hey Squidward! Look!
SpongeBob	Okay, Gare I'll get out of your hair, buddy.  See you later Gare.  Oh, you want to go for a walk. Sorry, but I don't have time for a walk right now. Gotta get to the old job. You just have to stay here alone by yourself. But I promise as soon as I'm done at work we'll play... together. OK.......Love you Gare-bear.
SpongeBob	My outgoing message is a lie.  Gary, are you there? Gary, it's SpongeBob. Just checking in. If you're there please pick up...
SpongeBob	Really Mr. Krabs? You'd let me do that?
SpongeBob	They're so precious!  SOLD! I'll take that one right there!
SpongeBob	Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks, bye.
SpongeBob	Eat up, you two.  Gary! What happen to your matters? You be nice and share with Puffy Fluffy.  Come here you.  There you are, Fluffy. Now eat up I'm gonna go make my enchiladas.
SpongeBob	Good. Because you can sleep with your new friend.  Aww, look at you two so cute together!
SpongeBob	Gary! Shame on you!  Puffy Fluffy is perfectly harmless.  See there he is fast asleep. Now will you let me sleep, Gary, please?  Good night.
SpongeBob	Gary!  You put Fluffy down right now! Bad boy, Gary!  Bad! Bad! Bad, boy! Bad! Bad Gary! Bad!  I have told and told you a told you and told you and told you and... Oh hello. Are you a friend of Fluffy?  What's goin' on? Okay, now this is starting to hurt.
SpongeBob	Ah, this is more like it. From now on I'm taking you wherever I go. No more lonely days alone at home.
SpongeBob	Sorry Patrick.
SpongeBob	Oh yeah.
SpongeBob	Oh it doesn't come with a toy.
SpongeBob	My purpose in life is to have you as my toy. .
SpongeBob	Our new toy?
SpongeBob	When's my turn?
SpongeBob	How about now?
SpongeBob	Yes! Today's my Patty Pal day! Oh, this is going to be fun!
SpongeBob	I heard that!  Good Morning Patrick!
SpongeBob	I have my milkshake dispenser operator license
SpongeBob	Oh, and you were washing your hair?!
SpongeBob	Gary was so right about you! You're a non-sharer!
SpongeBob	How about we trade off every hour?
SpongeBob	Five minutes?
SpongeBob	One.
SpongeBob	That mediator lady make some good points.
SpongeBob	Mine!
SpongeBob	Only if you have it all night.
SpongeBob	Patrick, that's my money.
SpongeBob	One large sea fries coming up!   Eeeeeee!
SpongeBob	Ooh! Can I call you Daddy?
SpongeBob	Papa?
SpongeBob	Krabby Joe?
SpongeBob	What's a tip?
SpongeBob	I cook Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Uh, Mr. Krabs is... a very generous pointer.
SpongeBob	Cheer up, Mr. Krabs. You may have not won the award, but you taught this sponge a lot about stinginess. Ooh! I almost forgot to pack these hotel toiletries!  And let's not forget these hotel towels!
SpongeBob	Duh!  Exaggerated!
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm bored.
SpongeBob	It's Old Man Squidward!
SpongeBob	Don't hurt us, Squidward!
SpongeBob	You're not The Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob	We're ghosts!  Yaayyy!
SpongeBob	Good night, Patrick. Being a ghost can sure tire ya out!
SpongeBob	I'm late for work!
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, old living employeer!
SpongeBob	Please, Mr. Dutchman, we can't take it! Constantly moaning and groaning!
SpongeBob	Hey. We're still ghosts.
SpongeBob	Well, here we are several months later! I wonder how the Flying Dutchman's doing on his date!
SpongeBob	Wow, what is it?
SpongeBob	No he doesn't! And I don't either!
SpongeBob	I didn't! I wore protective gloves! And besides, don't you like how classy it look now?
SpongeBob	Don't worry Squidward there's plenty of room!
SpongeBob	We just simply consult the card catalog and find.. Squidward's Clarinet drawer 368-B
SpongeBob	You're in good hands.
SpongeBob	Squidward, are you okay?
SpongeBob	Well, with all the ruckus you were making over it, I kept it with me, Just to make sure it was safe.
SpongeBob	Hmm.. I was just going to bring his clarinet.
SpongeBob	Thank you, Mr. Ranger.
SpongeBob	Patrick, guess what?
SpongeBob	That's the one.
SpongeBob	Big sign? I didn't see a big sig-JUMPING JELLYFISH, THAT'S A BIG SIGN!!!
SpongeBob	"Well, yeah, that's a simplified version, but yeah, something like that  which is why I hereby make this solemn vow to stop this so-called, ""Shelly Super Highway,"" from ever being built!"
SpongeBob	Too busy doing what?
SpongeBob	Really, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Charts and dia- MR.KRABS!!!!!!!!!! Didn't you see!?  After the Shelly Superhighway goes right through Jellyfish Fields, it goes right over the Krusty Krab! Gee, there you are, decrepit and living in a cardboard box! Then, it does a loop-de-loop for some reason, and goes right through the front door of the Chum Bucket!
SpongeBob	Why not!?
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Normally, Mr. Krabs, I would lie on my back and sob loudly too, but I am not giving up! There's still one citizen in Bikini Bottom who won't sit still in the face on this outrageous injustice!
SpongeBob	What for?
SpongeBob	What was that?
SpongeBob	See you later!
SpongeBob	Well, at least it ain't raining!
SpongeBob	Oh, a parade! Patrick, how did you come up with such a brilliant idea?
SpongeBob	C'mon! Let's go follow them!
SpongeBob	Knock it off, Patrick.
SpongeBob	But Squidward-
SpongeBob	It can't?
SpongeBob	First, I lost Jellyfish fields, and- and......
SpongeBob	Aw, ya don't?
SpongeBob	Well all I have to say is that um, well, STOP THE MADNESS! We need to get Jellyfish Fields back to the jellyfish, which will restore their natural habitat so they will be in peace. So what do you say everybody, will you help me?
SpongeBob	Larry Lobster!
SpongeBob	Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy!
SpongeBob	Still harder!
SpongeBob	Oh boy Jellyfishing, I cant wait! Can you Patrick?  Patrick? Patrick?
SpongeBob	Oh the magic clock from episode 1582! Man Rays power glove.
SpongeBob	Okay, Mr. Krabs, the dishes are done, I'm leaving!
SpongeBob	Okay, maybe just a little.
SpongeBob	Humph, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Gary, it's Patrick! I'm going to scare him! It's my turn.  Rawr!
SpongeBob	No, no! I'm the ghost of the Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob	Okay, okay, here's your candy.
SpongeBob	What's the difference between that ghost and me?
SpongeBob	Shave me down, make me round!
SpongeBob	Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob	Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob	Do you mean I'm not scary?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, it grows back!
SpongeBob	Hehehe! Don't worry! I can fix it!  Deeae!
SpongeBob	That's why Neptune gave us the rewind button!
SpongeBob	He was a good little Krabby Patty.  I didn't know him well, but in the few short seconds between grill and floor, I----I came to love him!  It just isn't fair!
SpongeBob	And you wrote that number on a chalkboard.
SpongeBob	What's this?
SpongeBob	Excuse me a moment.
SpongeBob	Do you think that I could go the rest of the day without crying?
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	Thanks again for walking with me, Squidward.
SpongeBob	It's...
SpongeBob	Yeah.  No! There shall be no tears in this house tonight!  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
SpongeBob	Ohh.  My subscription to Jellyfishing Monthly's expired. Remind me to renew that, will you, Squidward?
SpongeBob	What, what, what?
SpongeBob	Yes, Squidward?
SpongeBob	That's a really sad song, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Now you're talking!  Whatcha gonna read me, Squidward?
SpongeBob	I'm wondering if it might not be so healthy to hold in all my tears, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Oh, Mrs. Puff!?
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff?  Can I give you my note now?
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff!
SpongeBob	Oh boy! I get to show you the ropes Mrs. Puff! Hey, its kind of like I'm the teacher!  I'm gonna be teaching you now.
SpongeBob	Now like a ships rudder this old register is temperamental. When you hit the total key... What are you doing?  You're not taking notes!? Always remember: Good Grades.
SpongeBob	Good day ma lady, charmed, I'm sure.
SpongeBob	Psst, Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob again, you better inform the Duke that we don't serve beans on toast.
SpongeBob	Good job, Mrs. Puff! Now all that's left is to submit the order to the cook.
SpongeBob	1 Krabby Patty. Uh, Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	Don't forget to read the note!
SpongeBob	Hmm... I'd say a hydrated explosive.
SpongeBob	Smells like blubber to me.
SpongeBob	Hi, Plankton. Whatchya doin' laying on the middle of the road?
SpongeBob	Sorry to interrupt your gloating sir, I just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that Plankton is laying on the street, forlorn.
SpongeBob	Hi, Plankton.
SpongeBob	Mmm Hmm, and guess what else?  that was Mr. Krabs in whale suit that you've been scared of.
SpongeBob	Um, Plankton, if I were you I wouldn't be so smug.
SpongeBob	It's take Gary a walk in a park day!
SpongeBob	Mmm-mmm sea weed noodle stew.
SpongeBob	Come on Gary, it's time for beddy bye!  Night night, Gare-Bare.  Good Morning, Gary!  Hmm? He's not here. Oh. Right. He's probably playing with the litter box again.  Peek-a-boo!  Hmm? Not in here either.  Gary? Where are you?  Hmph. I am gonna teach that snail how to clean up after themselves.  Hun? What's this? Is this some kind of ransom note?  Holy Neptune! My pet Gary have been snailnapped by a deraged snaillover!!!  Don't worry Gare-bare, I'll save you!!
SpongeBob	Hold it right there! Hands off my Gary you snailnapper!
SpongeBob	You did wander out of the house on your own? But why?  Oh, I see why. Good Ol' fashion to Marry!
SpongeBob	Squidward's not at his post!
SpongeBob	And how may I help you on this fine day?
SpongeBob	PEE!
SpongeBob	And your shirt, is that a cotton-poly blend? Faaancy!
SpongeBob	But, Mr. Krabs, people pay to eat, right?
SpongeBob	Well, I don't see why not!
SpongeBob	Did I get the part?
SpongeBob	Oh, I can do that! Ahem! One Krabby Patty coming up!
SpongeBob	What have I done? Have I let the lure of theatre production get between me and my patties?
SpongeBob	Wait! Gentle patrons, Krabby Patties are meant to be eaten, not flung. Think of all the joy these greasy, juicy patties and their attendant condiments have given you.
SpongeBob	You are the best starer Ive ever stared at!
SpongeBob	How to open things. Brilliant, Patrick! I saw the movie, but I never read the book.
SpongeBob	Not at all. Read on.
SpongeBob	Karate?
SpongeBob	Clowns?  Dont go, Sandy! Its too risky!
SpongeBob	Patrick! This is no time for silly games! Sandy needs us. You understand? Patrick? Patrick!
SpongeBob	I need to find someone with compassion. Someone who selflessly helps others, with no concern for his own safety. I needA hero.
SpongeBob	Right-o, Mr. Tentacles, sir!
SpongeBob	Sandys in trouble. I need help rescuing her.
SpongeBob	I guess its just you and me, Gary.  Lets go. Gary the snail! Do you plan on staying here while Sandy is possibly in trouble somewhere up there?
SpongeBob	' Good morning!
SpongeBob	ItsTexas.
SpongeBob	Ahoy, Sandy!
SpongeBob	Aw, nuts.
SpongeBob	:  Quick, come inside!Wow, my very own great-grammyma. Why have we never met?
SpongeBob	: Great-Graaaaaaamyma...?
SpongeBob	: Hmmmm...
SpongeBob	: Knitting circles sure are fun, eh, Grammyma?
SpongeBob	: Would you settle for a Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob	: I'm just bringing in my great-grammyma for some lunch.
SpongeBob	: Well, here it is.
SpongeBob	: Okay, Grammyma, that's taken care of. I...  Grammyma! She must've made her own way up to the cash register all by herself! Maybe I'll catch up on my dishwashing while I have the chance. The Krusty Krab manual says it is always a good idea to start by turning the garbage disposal on, just in case there is anyleftover rubbish in the sink.Sounds like there's something stuck in the si- Grandma! Oh, I can't bear to look! Oh, Double-Great-Grammy-Grams, you were so soft and fragile like a... like a... like a...
SpongeBob	:  Here you go. I'll come back for you a little later.
SpongeBob	[Sings to himself, then addresses Gary] I'm sorry Gary. I thought you were done.'...  Wow. This town is sure going down hill.  Uhh. Mr. Krabs. What are you doing out here.
SpongeBob	You mean snail.
SpongeBob	What's so funny, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	CLOSE UP! Come on Gar. You're coming with me.
SpongeBob	Try telling that to my frizzled hands.
SpongeBob	Will do, captain.
SpongeBob	Ohh. Okay. The rivets are all rearranged.
SpongeBob	I'm sure he is. Bye.
SpongeBob	His sneagle?
SpongeBob	Don't you lie to me! I know all about you using Gary to steal money!
SpongeBob	That's hurtful, Mr. Krabs, and you know it!
SpongeBob	Hey. My Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fridge magnet!
SpongeBob	Oh, he's crying out for help.
SpongeBob	I must've been daydreaming. I saw you in this big monster's dripping maw, and I thought you were being eaten.
SpongeBob	And you are?  Nice to meet you, Mr.  Well, Rarrg, now that we're friends, I would like to show you my home.
SpongeBob	He's going to smash  house! Gary!  Gary! Jump, Gary, jump!  Parachute, Gary. Use your parachute.
SpongeBob	He waved at you, Squidward. That means he likes you.
SpongeBob	Don't thank me. Thank Raarg.
SpongeBob	For what?
SpongeBob	Not a Gary...Gary. He's my pet snail.  Say hello!
SpongeBob	Actually, a three day weekend.
SpongeBob	Let me show you how to feed him.  The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night.
SpongeBob	See you later, Patrick.
SpongeBob	What a great friend you are, Squidward.
SpongeBob	I knew it! Oh Squid, did you hear that?
SpongeBob	Gary!
SpongeBob	What's going to happen to me?
SpongeBob	Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!
SpongeBob	Sorry Gary, I couldn't control myself.  Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up?
SpongeBob	Look at me. Never better.  I'm okay! Squidward said I'm fine!
SpongeBob	Ha!Now I don't have to buy those new shoes!  I take it back, Gary. Something is wrong with meeeeeow!
SpongeBob	Meow!  Meow. Meow.  Meow!  Meow. Meow.
SpongeBob	Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow  .
SpongeBob	Your shell is gone too?
SpongeBob	I hope this doesn't mean that we're missing the one thing that's nearest and dearest to our heart.
SpongeBob	Where's your dad?
SpongeBob	Bikini Bottom Triangle?
SpongeBob	No, just a thick eerie fog.
SpongeBob	Come on, we've gotta find Mr. Krabs. The Krusty Krab needs him. Mr. Krabs?  Squidward, this is no time for seahorseplay!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! You've gotta get up. We gotta get out of here.
SpongeBob	That's it Mr. Krabs! I'll just find the mysterious singing mermaids and ask them how to get out of here!
SpongeBob	Yeah, we'd like to know how to get out of here, please.
SpongeBob	Oh, T.N.O.P! Okay, well thanks anyway, come on Patrick, let's go. Patrick?
SpongeBob	Well, sir, based on what the mermaids told me, there urr... there is no way out.
SpongeBob	That's it sir! It's the mermaids!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Need to know in case she ever- .
SpongeBob	Actually I told you to meet me two paces to the left.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	But what about the- the- the- the- the- the-
SpongeBob	They are, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, look!
SpongeBob	She gave me its business card.
SpongeBob	WOAAHHH!
SpongeBob	Morning, already.  I'm coming Mr. Krabs  Don't go anywhere!
SpongeBob	A closed sign?
SpongeBob	Okay! How about you, Squid-
SpongeBob	Hey, where'd all this water come from?  There we go. Oh my stars and garters, the sink is clogged up.  Safety.  Now what seem to be the trouble?  Patrick, what happened?
SpongeBob	The sink is clogged, so I was going to pull out the drain plug.
SpongeBob	The Main Drain sounds very, very dangerous. I'm never gonna go near that thing.
SpongeBob	Oh, Hi Plankton!
SpongeBob	I wonder who else knows about the Main Drain...
SpongeBob	Where is the Drain oh, wise Jenkins?
SpongeBob	What do you think, Patrick?
SpongeBob	But, Patrick how are we gonna get to the center of the ocean?
SpongeBob	I know!!
SpongeBob	Wow. Good job...
SpongeBob	We- We don't know...
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	I'm just displaying for all to see an attitude of gratitude!
SpongeBob	May I help you out?
SpongeBob	Well, it could be worse.
SpongeBob	Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor, please. I've got something.
SpongeBob	But, Squidward, it's imperative that we...
SpongeBob	That's funny, I remember turmeric third. And doesn't the recipe call for land salt?
SpongeBob	Hmm, I know! To keep Gary out fo the biscuit tin, I hide the biscuits somewhere far away, like Patrick's house. Unfortunately, Patrick ends up eating the biscuits anyway.
SpongeBob	Oh, no we forgot to look at the...
SpongeBob	Uh-huh.
SpongeBob	I humbly accept this key and vow to guard it with my very life.  It shan't leaveth my sight.
SpongeBob	Bye, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Thank you, my good man.  I've been hunting for a trash can for at least ten minutes. Thanks again, French guy.
SpongeBob	Ooh Fancy.
SpongeBob	But we haven't even heard the specials yet.
SpongeBob	That my dear Patrick isthe key!  Patrick, where is the key? Oh, no, I took a solemn oath.
SpongeBob	Yes. Search him, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Mr. Police Commissioner?
SpongeBob	The key!
SpongeBob	We know you did it. The butler always commits the crime.
SpongeBob	After all this, I still haven't found the key and I broke my vow to Mr. Krabs.  I don't deserve to work at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Uh, yeah, me, too.
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, on the count of three, we'll jump on, okay?
SpongeBob	Just do it.
SpongeBob	Yeah, and Plankton still has the key.  Patrick, we've got a big problem. Look.
SpongeBob	You broke the brake?
SpongeBob	Um, who?
SpongeBob	Means what? Means what? What does that mean, mister?
SpongeBob	Whoa! Whoa!
SpongeBob	And that was the story of the great train caper. Didn't you find it exciting?
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	Sit tight, Patrick! I'm coming to get you!  Nooo!
SpongeBob	Hmmmm... have we ever dug a tunnel  our two houses?
SpongeBob	Tag!
SpongeBob	Who's there?
SpongeBob	Awww. Squidward's house looks like it has an upset tummy.
SpongeBob	You told us not to walk on your yard, so, we walked under it.
SpongeBob	Squidward wins!
SpongeBob	Yuh oh!
SpongeBob	HIYA! HIYA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! Ta-daa! A gift, in your likeness.
SpongeBob	What, what you mean karate?
SpongeBob	Well I did say that Patrick but, well, karate is about finesse, not so much brute strength. You see, there's so much you don't know. You have not even scratched the surface of the surface.
SpongeBob	Think you can handle that?
SpongeBob	Look what you did to this wall of cinder blocks. In all my years of training, I've never seen a perfect slice. No ones ever been able to execute such a clean karate chop through a wall of cinder!
SpongeBob	This is an abandoned, broad-ironed steamboat, solid as a rock. Think you got what it takes?
SpongeBob	Not that!  ...this. : With power... comes responsibility. That means no chopping of any life from or their property. You understand?
SpongeBob	What are you doing...
SpongeBob	But, but, but-
SpongeBob	Cops? No, that won't be necessary. I'll handle this, citizen.
SpongeBob	For what?
SpongeBob	You're still chopping!
SpongeBob	Wait up, Patrick!  Triton's tunic!
SpongeBob	Patrick! Your arm!
SpongeBob	Patrick! I thought you gave up chopping!
SpongeBob	Sir, yes, sir!
SpongeBob	Hey, nice pass, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Okay, Squidward. I think that's everyone.
SpongeBob	You know, that didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would.
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward, what are you doing?
SpongeBob	Patrick, you can't go anywhere. We're trapped down here till they open that capsule in 50 years.
SpongeBob	My right foot was on blue.
SpongeBob	Wow, a water fountain for  people! What will the future think of next?
SpongeBob	Me too!  Do you want one too, Squidbeard?
SpongeBob	Ow!
SpongeBob	Squidward, we're playing tag! Not hide and seek, you silly!
SpongeBob	No Patrick, I mean do something extra special, and I think we should vow to it
SpongeBob	It's beauuuuuuuuuutiful!
SpongeBob	My turn! Ow!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, he's just not ready.  Ready now?
SpongeBob	Now?
SpongeBob	Now?
SpongeBob	Ready yet?
SpongeBob	I'd love to be at work today! But it's Sunday; the Krusty Krab is closed.
SpongeBob	"Um, sir, I believe I was in line first. . I spent the night! That's how you get the best spot around here!  I'm meeting my best friend for an exciting day at Glove World!.  See? ""Glove World!"" I promised Patrick we'd be first in line for the first bus to Glove World!."
SpongeBob	Glove World!! Glove World!! Glove World!!
SpongeBob	Oh, okay! Patrick, I'll catch the next bus! See you there!
SpongeBob	Grandma? Oh... coming, Grandma.
SpongeBob	Oh, it's true, Gar-bear! It's true!
SpongeBob	Ah, It fits like a glove!
SpongeBob	I've got an abrasive side! Abrasive side, abrasive side! I've got an abrasive side, and now I can say no! Abrasive side, abrasive side, abrasive side, abrasive side! Now I can say --
SpongeBob	Have a nice day, Grandma.
SpongeBob	Oh, I can't wait...
SpongeBob	That's weird. I wonder what's wrong with Patrick.
SpongeBob	Patrick, you know the answer to that question is-
SpongeBob	But, Mr. Krabs, I would never use immoderate language like...
SpongeBob	I can't take it anymore! It's like a... a virus!
SpongeBob	To anybody. So I got this abrasive side to help change my personality.
SpongeBob	So long, Abrasivey!  Grandma! I've got to apologize to Grandma!  Grandma? Hello Grandma, I'm sorry about earlier. So, what do ya say? Can we discuss forgiveness over a cup of your famous hot cocoa?
SpongeBob	Thowwy, Thquidward.
SpongeBob	"Ooh! It's ""Musical Doodle,"" Squidward!Round and round the record spins all day. Listen again. It takes you far away. Trying to stop it is futile. So just listen now to my musical doodle! Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo..."
SpongeBob	"""Musical Doodle."""
SpongeBob	Trying to stop it is futile. So just listen now to my Musical Doodle. Listen again to the Musical Doodle.  WHOO! Let's spin that record one more time!  Wow. It's late. I have to get to sleep.  Come to bed when you're ready, Gary.  Oh, fine. I'll just listen to it one more time to get it out of my system. Round and round the record spins all day. Listen again. It takes you far away. Trying to stop it is futile. So just listen now to my Musical Doodle. Listen again to the Musical Doodle!  Let's listen to it one more time. Round and round the record spins all day. One more time!Round and round the record spins all day.
SpongeBob	Think you control it, but it's way too hard. Every time it plays, there's an electric charge.  Hang on. Hang on. Play that last part back for me.  That's it! I shouldn't try to control it. I should stop fighting the Doodle's infectious groove. Trying to stop it is futile. So just listen now to my Musical Doodle! Think you control it, but it's way too hard. Doo doo doo-doo doo-doo doo doo doo!
SpongeBob	Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo! Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo!
SpongeBob	Trying to escape is futile! Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo-doo! Doo doo doo doo-doo! The Musical Doodle!
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Okay! I figure that that spot over there by those rocks is a good place to-
SpongeBob	Thousands!
SpongeBob	Patrick, it's simple.  A person stands behind a rock, like this.  Then they cover their eyes.  And count while the other person runs and hides!
SpongeBob	Oh, good!
SpongeBob	Hey, you really are getting it!
SpongeBob	No Patrick, forget about the socks.
SpongeBob	Now I'm all over, where am I gonna hide?  Hmmm.  That's definitely one idea.
SpongeBob	Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty...  Ninety-nine,  a hundred! Now where is he hiding?  Nah, way too obvious.  Come out, come out wherever you are!  Patrick!  Patrick!  This is gonna be harder than I thought.
SpongeBob	Squidward,
SpongeBob	Hey Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	The fee?
SpongeBob	Hi Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob	Are you sure?
SpongeBob	Are you sure you're sure...
SpongeBob	I know.
SpongeBob	"Darn it. ""Welcome to the end of the world, cafe and gift shop""."
SpongeBob	Oh. Oh well thanks anyway.
SpongeBob	Patrick not-star? Oh no! You aren't the one I'm seeking! Now i'll never find Patrick! He wins at hide and seek! He wins. He wins.
SpongeBob	Hey, you're right! Thanks Patrick not-star.
SpongeBob	I was just leaving this note for you.
SpongeBob	Good night, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	"Gasp! Mr. Krabs, did you forget what tomorrow is? It's ""Bring Your Pet To Work"" day!"
SpongeBob	I checked the freezer, the spare freezer, the back-up freezer, extra freezer, the rear freezer, the micro freezer, and the freezer under the stairs!
SpongeBob	A fresh batch?
SpongeBob	No! Mr. Krabs, I promise that Gary will be clean. I'll make sure he takes an extra long bath tonight!
SpongeBob	Great, Gary,just great! Now you need an extra, extra, extra, extra long bath! You're not going to come down from there, are you?
SpongeBob	Gary! The bath is ready!
SpongeBob	Ahhh, smells nice, doesn't it?
SpongeBob	Gary, are you feeling alright?
SpongeBob	You're right, Gary! I have to call Mr. Krabs and tell him I'm late! Gosh, Gary, your a lot talkative when you're sick.  Doctor, My pet snail is turning green and he's talking. Is he alright?
SpongeBob	Please save him, doctor!
SpongeBob	Sure thing, Gary, but...
SpongeBob	Just a little further, Gare-bare.
SpongeBob	With pleasure, Mr. Krabs. (puts on rubber gloves and gets the key from underneath his shoe. Puts the key into the stove ignition and turns it on to work like a car. Pushes on the pedal) I love this part of the job.
SpongeBob	(gets on his knees and bows to Mr. Krabs) Thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you. It is both an honor and a privilege that I shall---
SpongeBob	You want me to go undercover?
SpongeBob	Well, you'd be mistaken sir because this pen is also...a pencil. Hmm? Pretty sweet undercover spy stuff, huh, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	I have infiltrated the line right now, and I'll report back once I obtained sample.
SpongeBob	Other than the faux dilapidation, not really.
SpongeBob	(babbling) I do.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Correct.
SpongeBob	Isn't it? I can't believe no one was using it. (SpongeBob took the rock from a museum, which collapses from not having the rock)
SpongeBob	I read you loud and clear, captain. Loud and clear. (swings on the statue's nose and it falls on top of him) Wow, this is heavy.
SpongeBob	Whoa! Do you think we caused an earthquake by hitting the ground too hard?
SpongeBob	Patrick, do you mind? I've gotta wring myself out.
SpongeBob	Whelks? Heh, I'm not afraid of some goofy old sea snails!
SpongeBob	Patrick, what happened?
SpongeBob	Squidward, it swallowed Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Uh, action packed, please?
SpongeBob	Patrick, look!
SpongeBob	Now, let's get the rest of you cleaned!
SpongeBob	It's one of the activities in our favorite magazine.  Simple-Ton: A ton of simple things to do!
SpongeBob	You go first, Patrick.
SpongeBob	I'll go first.  Question 1: What is your best friend's favorite color? Hmmm.... I'm thinking........AQUAMARINE!
SpongeBob	Is your best friend's belly button have an innie or an outie?
SpongeBob	Okay! First question: What is your best friend's favorite color?
SpongeBob	Sorry, Patrick, I'm ambidextrous!
SpongeBob	Well, I'm sure you'll get the next one right! What is your best friend's favorite food?
SpongeBob	Uh, last question!
SpongeBob	SQUARE-pants.
SpongeBob	Hey Pearl!
SpongeBob	Oh! I'm a single rider!  Excuse me, Pardon me, Excuse me, Pardon me, Excuse me, Pardon me!
SpongeBob	I bet Mr. Krabs would get a kick out of this ride, don't you think? I mean he's so tough on the outside, but he's got a soft side, too. You know, this one time I was upset because my snail Gary he was sick and he let me leave 5 minutes early. Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever heard?  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
SpongeBob	It's okay Pearl, it's only the dark. There's nothin' scary about... the dark! It's whats in the dark you gotta watch out for. Monsters, creeps, ghouls, CLOWNS, witches, werewolves, CLOWNS, crawly things, CRAWLY CLOWNS, those are the worst CRAWLY CLOWNS.
SpongeBob	Maybe I'll just stay up here... keep an eye out for any other creepies.
SpongeBob	Or ghostly pirates!   Or laboratory creatures!
SpongeBob	Shhh. Did you hear that?
SpongeBob	A ha ha ha, he.
SpongeBob	Wow! How romantical.
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	Top of the morning to ya!  Krusty Krab! SpongeBob speaking!  Gary? Is that you?  Gary, I know you're there. I can hear you breathing!  Oooh!
SpongeBob	And then I just cook it like this!
SpongeBob	My Krusty Dog! Handwritten on the menu! Oh, pinch me Squidward!
SpongeBob	I'll get those going after I finish cooking up these Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob	E-raser?
SpongeBob	I had this horrible dream. That Mr. Krabs would never let me cook Krabby Patties again.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, isn't that where the grill used to be?
SpongeBob	Squidward, can I talk to you for 1 second?
SpongeBob	I don't know why, but  things aren't just the same after Krusty Dogs were added to the menu.
SpongeBob	I know. Well, I guess I sorta miss the Krabby Patties. After all, they're what gave this place it's name.
SpongeBob	Yes!  Eat one and you'll develop an unsightly skin condition.
SpongeBob	Nose hair and recycled dental floss.
SpongeBob	Wiener
SpongeBob	And that is to loudly decry these modern, new fangled days of wieners, and to band for a return to a simpler time. A Krabby Pattier time!
SpongeBob	Yea, blow up.  Squidward, that's it!
SpongeBob	Can I bring you something else?  Okay, I guess not. Thank you sir.
SpongeBob	Oooh! I know the answer.
SpongeBob	Not for long!
SpongeBob	Exactly! Neither of us will know!
SpongeBob	Let's go back to the main deck.
SpongeBob	Mauna Loa, how I love ya, oh, my secret lovin' hideaway! My Mauna Loa bay-a bay!
SpongeBob	Patrick, please! What are you trying to do?! Give away our secret hideout?! Give me that!
SpongeBob	Come on, Patrick. We've got to get back to our playground.
SpongeBob	Just as I thought. We're being followed. That's it!  Heh, looks like no one was following us to the secret hideout after all!
SpongeBob	If my eyes weren't burning like they were full of lava, I could show you.
SpongeBob	Well, you usually find tickets in a ticket booth.
SpongeBob	Remember, you're always welcome back at the secret hideout.
SpongeBob	How 'bout another ride to cheer you up?
SpongeBob	Oh, who knows, Patrick? The next fun, fun place might be just around the corner, huh?
SpongeBob	I love this show!
SpongeBob	Double overhand squirrel knot!
SpongeBob	Well, it goes like this!  Oh wait, I forgot the punch line.  Oh, yeah!  That's a good one, isn't it?  What a beautiful day. Beautiful sky. Beautiful plants. Hi plants. Beautiful...  pile of cans? Mmm, mmm, Sandy, that is your worst disguise yet.
SpongeBob	Curses!
SpongeBob	Order up.
SpongeBob	But sir, she snuck up on me. In my own dojo.
SpongeBob	Yes, ma'am. I mean, sir. I mean, boss. I mean, poobah!
SpongeBob	Fired?  No more karate? How am I gonna tell Sandy?
SpongeBob	No, really! Please, stop!
SpongeBob	Fired?
SpongeBob	I know! We can act like plants.  Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis.
SpongeBob	Not karate.
SpongeBob	Right now? I mean, no! What is this karate?  Uhh, what do you want on your sandwich?
SpongeBob	One for you!
SpongeBob	Sure thing, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Maybe just one more. Or two!
SpongeBob	Right!
SpongeBob	More buns!
SpongeBob	Do you think Mr. Krabs ever does karate?  Mr. Krabs!  Uhh, hey Mr. Krabs, hows it going?  Nice day, huh?  Oh, alright, Mr. Krabs. You caught me. But you know what? I just can't help myself. You're just gonna have to fire me.
SpongeBob	Good Job Patrick.
SpongeBob	Oh Squidward, that reminds me. Patrick and I are off to Jellyfish Fields for the day. We were wondering if maybe you can stick around and keep an eye out for any takers.
SpongeBob	Oh, well thanks anyway, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Yes!
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	C'mon, Squidward. Turn that frown upside down!
SpongeBob	Boy, you were floundering up there!
SpongeBob	"Hey, Idward Squay. 'Emeber ray the eat day.  I believe Squidward here is trying to ask you out on a romantic date, ma'am, right Squidward? Come on, Squidward. Shake the nice lady's hand and say ""Hello."""
SpongeBob	The point is he thinks you look like a ray of pure sunshine in that dress.
SpongeBob	But you know what is the most amazing thing about Squidward?  It's his selflessness, his undying commitment to being a true friend. And I know anyone who is lucky enough to go on a romantical date with this guy would get to experience things on a whole 'nother very special level. So, how does dinner at 8:00 sound, Squilvia?
SpongeBob	You my friend are in desperate need of a practice date.
SpongeBob	I'm ready!
SpongeBob	I don't think I've dropped anything... Ooh! You shouldn't have.
SpongeBob	A gentlemen always opens a door for a lady.
SpongeBob	Yes.
SpongeBob	At that stop sign make a right.
SpongeBob	Why thank you, Mr. Squidward!  Way to compliment the date, Squidward.
SpongeBob	This is the perfect opportunity to work on your table etiquette.
SpongeBob	Well, this is my home, silly.
SpongeBob	Um, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Hey buddy, what are you cleaning for?
SpongeBob	Gee, I'm sorry Patrick.
SpongeBob	No no don't be upset with Squidward. He doesn't mean it, Don't you Squidward?
SpongeBob	It's not like that at all Patrick. I was just-
SpongeBob	Now Sam it's not what it seems. Squidward was just rearranging the spiffy.
SpongeBob	Squidward, Squidward stop!  Just calm down buddy. Let's ease that tentacle off of the accelerator, hmmm?
SpongeBob	Patrick?
SpongeBob	You called me SpongeBob. I thought we agreed to address each other by our proper titles.
SpongeBob	Plankton? is that you?
SpongeBob	Can you please call me lab partner?
SpongeBob	Hey! Who turned out the lights?
SpongeBob	Look, no hands! Or feet.
SpongeBob	The Krabby Patty formula! But if that's here, then where's Plankton?
SpongeBob	It's all right here, Mr. Krabs. The Bikini Bottom OWS Worker Safety Guidlines. Let's see, it says here...blah blah blah blah, accident... blah blah blah blah, owner negligence... blah blah blah blah, substantial fines.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I finished the OWS report. Question 1: Was the accident the cause of criminal negligence.  Mr. Krabs, what is criminal negligence.
SpongeBob	Ok, one more time.
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs, Plankton will figure out the Krabby Patty formula.
SpongeBob	If only there was some way to bring you two back together.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs, I have great news!
SpongeBob	I'm digging, Mr. Krabs, I'm digging.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, do you hear something?  I gotcha, Mr. Krabs. I gotcha!  Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	I need to-- I'm okay.  The fish hooks are coming!
SpongeBob	See? You guys are agreeing already. That's the first step to cooperation.
SpongeBob	Ta-da! I started the Flabby Patty restaurant just to get you two rascals to team up. And so the power of friendship triumphs again.
SpongeBob	No, I mean the toothpaste!
SpongeBob	A drive--- woah!
SpongeBob	I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. How is this stuff better than I bought?
SpongeBob	Squidward! Hi!
SpongeBob	Geeehh! .
SpongeBob	-Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries, sir? Anything for our boys in blue!
SpongeBob	26 orders up!
SpongeBob	Don't worry Mr. Krabs!  We can fix it!  We might want to buy some more toothpaste though.
SpongeBob	It wasn't?
SpongeBob	I can't believe that I'm in the presence of such big celebrities.
SpongeBob	IT'S NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU TONY FAST JR!
SpongeBob	Relax... RELAX!? Mrs. Puff hasn't taught us that yet!
SpongeBob	Be cool?
SpongeBob	Yeeahh!
SpongeBob	It's SpongeBob SquarePants!
SpongeBob	Oohh! Uh, what does that mean?
SpongeBob	My favorite!? Oh I couldn't!
SpongeBob	Wow Tony Jr! She handles like a dream! It's like I'm floating air!
SpongeBob	Let go... got it!  Whee!
SpongeBob	Whee... RED LIGHT!
SpongeBob	Right here, right now? A little short notice...  let me check my availability.  Let's see... Right now... Looks like I don't have anything scheduled for right now. Therefore, I would like to accept your challenge!
SpongeBob	I would never want to embarrass you Tony Jr. Therefore, I accept your challenge!
SpongeBob	We're winning! We're winning!
SpongeBob	What're we going to do!?
SpongeBob	DO YOU SEE WHERE LETTING GO HAS GOTTEN US SO FAR!?!? HUH TONY JR!?!?
SpongeBob	Patrick! Tee time, Patrick! Patrick!  Tee time, Patrick!  Patrick! Wake up!
SpongeBob	I was really looking forward to a day of sportsmanship and male bonding. Thanks a lot, rain! Hey, that gives me an idea.
SpongeBob	Better tone down the calisthenics, Patrick. Don't wanna upset Squidward.
SpongeBob	Patrick, you have to play it where it lands.
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	Patrick, the only hazard I can see is you standing in my shot.
SpongeBob	Uh-oh. Oh well, I guess that's game point.
SpongeBob	Now where is that darn ball?
SpongeBob	Patrick, you ate my ball?
SpongeBob	There it is!
SpongeBob	Aha!
SpongeBob	What are you doing?
SpongeBob	Play it where it lies?
SpongeBob	This one's for all the marbles.
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward, what happened to your dentures?
SpongeBob	Thanks for your help, Gar!
SpongeBob	Hmm. Maybe Patrick is right. All of these things do hold precious memories.  No!  Come on, you!  Gotcha! Welcome home, precious memories.  Plastic wrap is neat, huh, Gary?
SpongeBob	Oh, perfect!  Ah, memories. Greasy memories.
SpongeBob	Oh, well, better get these precious memories home.
SpongeBob	Like the front yard!
SpongeBob	Oh, hi, Squidward, can I help you?
SpongeBob	Hi!
SpongeBob	Wait! Please don't condemn my house.
SpongeBob	I know.  I'm gonna miss them so much!
SpongeBob	Your pay, my good man.
SpongeBob	Oh, I forgot to tell you, I took so many pictures I ran out of room in my house.
SpongeBob	Hey, you like karate too!  So, uhh, what's your name?
SpongeBob	Uh, I like you too, Sandy. Hi-yah! Ow. Say, what is that thing on your head?
SpongeBob	"Why, ""air"" is my middle name! The more air, the better! Can't get enough of that air."
SpongeBob	I guess so.
SpongeBob	Thanks pal.
SpongeBob	No water?
SpongeBob	Yes, I'm okay.
SpongeBob	Take your time.  I gotta get out of here! Aaaaahh!
SpongeBob	I'm a quitter!
SpongeBob	You're... doing it... wrong...
SpongeBob	No!  Ouch! Where am I?  Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
SpongeBob	Gary! You can talk!
SpongeBob	Gee Gary, you sure are smart.
SpongeBob	You know Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
SpongeBob	Ooh, this is gonna be good!  Psst! Squidward!  Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob	La la! La la la la la la la!
SpongeBob	Hey Sandy! What's going on?
SpongeBob	Gotcha!
SpongeBob	Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.
SpongeBob	What are you talking about?
SpongeBob	Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Yes, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!
SpongeBob	I think he's got the point.
SpongeBob	Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?
SpongeBob	Hi Patrick! Where's your sleigh?
SpongeBob	Patrick, do you hear that?
SpongeBob	Aaaaa! Hop in, sir! We'll get you out of here!
SpongeBob	Gary!
SpongeBob	Don't tell me, Mr. Krabs. You peeled at those tentacles with your bare claws! You single-handedly saved your vessel from certain DOOM!
SpongeBob	Gary! Step on it!  Oh yeah, Gary, you are really motivated now! Right, guys?  We forgot Squidward!  Left, Gary! Left! There he is!
SpongeBob	No wait Sandy, I see it too! It looks like... Karen.
SpongeBob	Patrick, no! He's very--...fragile.
SpongeBob	Well, what are we waiting for?  You heard the lady, Gary, southwest! Marsh! Marsh!
SpongeBob	Hey Sandy, have you given any thought to we're gonna--...land.
SpongeBob	No, we're not! We'll-- Hello, what's this?  Look! One of Mr. Krabs's sailor tattoos! It must've frozen off his brittle body.
SpongeBob	Gary, Mr. Krabs, any hazards on the horizon?
SpongeBob	Perhaps over there..
SpongeBob	Nom nom?
SpongeBob	Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happens to Plankton?
SpongeBob	You ready for some fun old pal?
SpongeBob	Here comes another one!
SpongeBob	Patrick! You have a beard!
SpongeBob	May I tag along and observe your instruction?
SpongeBob	Alright! Distinguished!
SpongeBob	Oh boy! Eats!  Yum! Yum! Yum!
SpongeBob	Beard... I must remove that beard!  Remove beard! Restore friendship!
SpongeBob	But-
SpongeBob	Dear friend, don't say that it is all over! My heart bounces on rocks, jagged and gray! Dear friend, don't that it is all over! Let's stay pals! What do! You say?
SpongeBob	Because Mr. Patrick Star...  You told me.
SpongeBob	Okay! Okay!  Hm, what's so scary about public speaking anyway? You just stand in front of the public and speak publicly. It's really no different to what I do everyday.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I wonder if you'd help me by lending me your eyes.
SpongeBob	Not now, Patrick. Just sit tight and let me practice.
SpongeBob	So, without further ado...  Patrick?  Patrick, wake up.  What happened, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Okay.  Boating safety...  Boating safe...
SpongeBob	Uh, you sorta add a hand in that too Patrick.
SpongeBob	Boating safety...
SpongeBob	Well, if I don't do my report then I don't pass. And if I don't pass then I don't get my boating license!
SpongeBob	Eh! Ooh, they work.
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff, do I really have to do this?
SpongeBob	"""Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the ocean because --"
SpongeBob	Boating safety? Well, yes, Officer. I do.  Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the whole ocean. Each boater must follow the rules and regulations stipulated in the boater safety handbook. When the meaning of all important signs... ...pay attention to all surroundings... ...when wet means no parking... ...it already figures... ...always blah blah blah... ...with all shades of curve... ...remember... ...a motor vehicle is 20,000 pounds of blah blah--
SpongeBob	Just a little grill-side harmony. Everyone knows that cooking and music go together like... eating and listening.
SpongeBob	Hi, Plankton. Nice dress.
SpongeBob	Yeah, especially his favorite kind of music, his own.
SpongeBob	Ouch, Squidward, this game is fun!
SpongeBob	Oh, hi Squid...  Whoa!  I love your hat.
SpongeBob	And I made this wallet,  and I crocheted money to go in it.
SpongeBob	A little glue...
SpongeBob	Now you try!
SpongeBob	Yeah, let's take a look!
SpongeBob	Wow! Did you hear that, Squidward? Patrick is an artist!
SpongeBob	Oh! I'm almost late to be early for work! See ya later, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Make yourself comfortable, Mister Patrick! Our artistic consultant will be right with you!
SpongeBob	You did it, Patrick! You found your inspiration!
SpongeBob	Welcome friends! Please come in!
SpongeBob	Weren't you going to put your vacation slides in the projector, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Now you put the slides in the projector.
SpongeBob	Patrick! Patrick, what have you done to yourself?
SpongeBob	"""Stay home""? That's it. You can take a ""stay-cation."""
SpongeBob	Everything okay in there, oh great genie?
SpongeBob	Ha ha ha ha! Mail call!
SpongeBob	Right this way, sir!
SpongeBob	Whoa! Aahh!
SpongeBob	Order up, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Who is this someone? Do we know him?
SpongeBob	Where are you going?
SpongeBob	Morning, Mr. Bakerman! Oh, that's right, I'm sorry. I have to pick a number.
SpongeBob	"I got it! ""See you soon!"
SpongeBob	I am?! Whoooooo! Moon trip! Moon trip! Moon trip!  Hey Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Hey, Sandy...
SpongeBob	Wha, wha, wha, why not?
SpongeBob	Roger that! Folding hands.
SpongeBob	What's moon crater boarding?
SpongeBob	Ok.
SpongeBob	Oops!
SpongeBob	Well, in that case, I wont giant fireball?!  Sandy, where are you going?
SpongeBob	Oh, oh my gosh! Sandy! Sandy, are you okay?  Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I ruined your vacation.
SpongeBob	Yes! Please!
SpongeBob	I will happily honor this family tradition.
SpongeBob	Um, Mr. Krabs? Think we could make a bathroom stop?
SpongeBob	Not really.
SpongeBob	Uh, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is starting at us.  Sir, get a hold of yourself! It's just paper!
SpongeBob	We better catch up with them before we miss something, right Mr. Krabs?  Gasp!  MR. KRABS!
SpongeBob	Wah oh!
SpongeBob	That didn't work at all!
SpongeBob	Uh oh...
SpongeBob	Don't be silly, Gary. I don't get colds. I get the suds.
SpongeBob	No, Gary. I like wearing my underwear like this.
SpongeBob	Here's that patty you wanted, Mr. Krabs, sir.
SpongeBob	Sandy, I'm sick.  Can you escort me to the doctor's?
SpongeBob	Why not, Patrick?
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	I don't know.
SpongeBob	My fingers are too big for the buttons. Dr. Patrick, will you call Sandy for me?
SpongeBob	I don't...think so.
SpongeBob	Uh-uh.
SpongeBob	I'm ok, Sandy, really.
SpongeBob	I can't stop now!  Help me!
SpongeBob	Whoo! Yeah! Whoo!  This tickles!  I can smell again!  Whoo! Yeah! Yeah-eah! Whoo!  I feel as good as new! I love the doctor!
SpongeBob	Hmm. It does. Hey, look at that one.  It looks just like Mr. Krabs, doesn't it?
SpongeBob	I don't know, Patrick, it's very scary-looking and spooky.
SpongeBob	I don't know, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Yeah, that'd be  neato.  Patrick, where is that music coming from?
SpongeBob	Yeah, awesome
SpongeBob	Why have you come to Bikini Bottom, oh mighty dead person, sir?
SpongeBob	Um, can we run screaming in horror from your ship now, Mr. Ghost Captain, sir?
SpongeBob	Ghosts, ghosts, a haunted houseboat!
SpongeBob	We were just minding our own business and a haunted houseboat fell out of the sky!
SpongeBob	I'll go, but just to get my soul back.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I wouldn't touch that if I were you! That gold probably has ghost germs all over it.
SpongeBob	But what about our real souls?
SpongeBob	It is my civic duty to report stolen property!
SpongeBob	We got to make sure we have the necessary supplies for this marathon.
SpongeBob	Lampshade?
SpongeBob	It's time, Patrick! I hope we can make do with the few provisions we have...
SpongeBob	I don't know, Patrick. All the TV's in Bikini Bottom are knocked out! We have to find a secure place, some place that can survive this whirlwind.  Hey, that's it. If we want to see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's origin, we'll just go to the source. Follow me, Patrick.
SpongeBob	So, if we want to hear their origin, why don't we just ask them?
SpongeBob	Ohhhh, so that's how you guys got together.
SpongeBob	So superhero awesome!
SpongeBob	Uh, I'm not following you.
SpongeBob	No, not particularly.
SpongeBob	La la la la!
SpongeBob	Yes sir, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Hey, glad I could help.
SpongeBob	Why wouldn't I?
SpongeBob	Don't fear, Pearl. We'll get rid of this barnacle in no time! I know just what to do!
SpongeBob	No. The barnacle. It became convinced it was a pelican and flew south for the winter. We never saw that pelican again.
SpongeBob	Now just remain calm and it's all over before you know it.
SpongeBob	Gettin' there.
SpongeBob	Pearl!  Pearl, what happened?
SpongeBob	Because this soap smells so wonderful! That's why. Hmm, I know this fragrance from somewhere.  Oh, I'm sorry, did you want a whiff?
SpongeBob	Something wrong, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	I have no idea.  Don't worry, Pearl. I'll fix your crying!
SpongeBob	Hello?  Something there? Pearl?!  Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Leftover Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob	Wait a minute, Pearl, say that again!
SpongeBob	We shall see shortly.
SpongeBob	Of course! Pearl's wearing it to the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!
SpongeBob	Oh, Gramma's turning even older! I can't wait to celebrate!  Sorry, Gary, I am gonna miss you when I'm gone...but, if I'm not here, who's going to take care of you?
SpongeBob	Gary, is that true?
SpongeBob	Patrick, what are you doing?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	It's a chronological list of all the things you need to do with Gary. Make sure you do each and every one.
SpongeBob	Okay, Gary. I'll be home by ten.  Dear Patrick, just do verify.  First, you feed Gary, then you pet Gary, then you-
SpongeBob	Gary. Oh, Gary.
SpongeBob	Patrick, it's SpongeBob. How's Gary?
SpongeBob	And remember to dry him off really good.
SpongeBob	Gramma, can I use your phone again?
SpongeBob	He's what? He's what, Patrick? Gary is what?!  What is happening to them?!  They need my help!  Gramma! Gramma!
SpongeBob	Good morning to you too, Gary. Help yourself to some breakfast kibble while I make ready for my day at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	I would love to.
SpongeBob	Not gonna happen.
SpongeBob	Patrick, what do you take me for?
SpongeBob	Okay. Now, let's check the list to see what's nex...Patrick, You promised me you weren't gonna touch anything.
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, tell me again what it is you're gonna do.
SpongeBob	Until when? Until...?
SpongeBob	Well I I guess I can't handle it after all I I'm a failure. (SpongeBob cries)
SpongeBob	It is?
SpongeBob	Hooray!
SpongeBob	Sure. Thanks, Squidward! Gee, looks like playing Kelpy G's music here in the restaurant has really energized him.
SpongeBob	You forgot to buy a ticket?
SpongeBob	I am?
SpongeBob	You said it, lady. I've been a diehard since 10:00 this morning. Who's ready for a Kelpy G concert tonight?!
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	It's no problem, Squidward, really, I
SpongeBob	Guess what? There's a second lemonade stand!
SpongeBob	Whoo! Kelpy, yeah! Put your hands together, people.
SpongeBob	It's okay, Squidward, you're the biggest Kelpy G fan I know. Please, take my backstage pa
SpongeBob	SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob	You know, Patrick,  we should spice up our bubble blowing.
SpongeBob	Let's go to Sandy's.
SpongeBob	I know Sandy. I'll use these spicy bubbles. They'll clean out your pipes for you.
SpongeBob	Whoo!  How's Sandy doing back there?
SpongeBob	Blah! Fresh air. Let's hurry up and get this over with.
SpongeBob	Sandy, what are you doing? The air is up there.
SpongeBob	Never fear. I know what to do. We can use these straws to suck the bubbles down.
SpongeBob	Hurry up, Patrick.
SpongeBob	And you breathe air, right?
SpongeBob	I'll use this tank of oxygen as a makeshift rocket.
SpongeBob	Yeah, here we go.
SpongeBob	Boy, I can't wait to show Sandy my new karate moves,  oh, Sandy, aaah...  Sandy is in trouble, don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming to save you!
SpongeBob	But Sandy, you already have a black belt.
SpongeBob	Hm?
SpongeBob	Mm-mmm! Yeah, okay.
SpongeBob	Oh, wait! Sensei!
SpongeBob	Here...I'm right here... I've readied myself...into a full state of readiness...and I am ready...to be ready...I'm so tired...I'm so tired...so very tired...
SpongeBob	Easy for you to say Sandy. Your pants aren't down right around your ankles.
SpongeBob	Stick to what I'm good at? Hey, Squidward's right!
SpongeBob	Oh! I forgot the fries!
SpongeBob	Make the fires! I almost forgot!
SpongeBob	For me? Thanks Fuzzy! Fuzzy? You look terrible!  Sandy, what's wrong with Fuzzy?
SpongeBob	Ok.  Step one:  Patrick and I get to the Valentine's Day carnival.  Step two: I position Patrick and myself on top of the Ferris wheel.  Step three: You arrive at designated checkpoint for maximum visual contact.  Step four: Patrick is thrilled. Mission accomplished.  Hi Patrick.
SpongeBob	Patrick...
SpongeBob	It's the greatest...  ...the bestest...  ...the most fantabulous...  ...present ever!  But you can't have it yet.
SpongeBob	Do you want to ruin the surprise?
SpongeBob	No can do!  You'll just have to wait!
SpongeBob	Here, why don't you take this quarter and...
SpongeBob	Ten-four Sandy, SpongeBob here.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Are you sure?  SpongeBob to Sandy, you can bring it in now.
SpongeBob	Uhh...Patrick, actually it's on the Ferris...
SpongeBob	Patrick, here it is!
SpongeBob	Uh, no problem Fran.
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, I know I deserve this.  But, do they?
SpongeBob	Patrick, just turn around!
SpongeBob	Hey, little bubble. Where'd you come from? Perhaps this letter will shed some light on your origin. It's from my old friend, Bubble Buddy. I wonder what's up with him.  Let's see: Dear, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob	You're gonna like Squidward. He's lots of fun.
SpongeBob	Hold still, Shiny. Gotcha!
SpongeBob	Shiny, come back!  There he is!  He's headed for that open window!
SpongeBob	Hi, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Oh! You might wanna be careful with those sharp claws, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Yessiree, Shiner. You show me a sizzling grill, and I'll show you a happy customer.
SpongeBob	Shiny? Shiny where are you?
SpongeBob	"""Bikini Bottom Pin Factory""? Don't worry, Shiny. I'm coming!  Shiny, you have to be more careful. You could get popped in a place like that. Hold on. There's something tickling my nose."
SpongeBob	Okay, let's skip the pillow foundry. I'll just take you to my house.
SpongeBob	Uh oh.
SpongeBob	Oh, he was a little angel... in a little devil sort of way.
SpongeBob	I am sharpening my trusty spatula. Speaking of which, are you going to stick around for morning fry-cook calisthenics?
SpongeBob	Please?
SpongeBob	Oh-uh, Squidward, the grill is on.
SpongeBob	Technically, I drove him up the wall.
SpongeBob	Served? I don't understand. Squidward, what is these guys-
SpongeBob	Uh, sirs? If I can't speak to or get within 15 feet of Squidward, how are we going to get anything done around here?
SpongeBob	Oh no! My two best friends are fighting!  But this restraining order says I can't get close enough to break it off!  I'm sorry restraining order! But my friends need me!  STOP!!!
SpongeBob	I violated the restraining order! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
SpongeBob	Really, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Oh, I know! Win a date with Squidward Tuesday!
SpongeBob	Great idea, Squidward!
SpongeBob	So you see why Mr. Krabs is trying to get it back.
SpongeBob	Who's that?
SpongeBob	Now you've gone too far!
SpongeBob	Now Patrick is harboring stolen merchandise in his belly!
SpongeBob	Whoa!
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squidward.  I have a whole cabinet of backups.  So what's  happiest memory, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Well, with joy, Squidward, with joy.
SpongeBob	You love music, right, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Oops. That was a sour note.
SpongeBob	Your happiest memory?
SpongeBob	Oh yeah! I forgot about your blindfold!  Isn't it beautiful?
SpongeBob	Gary, I am worried about Squidward. He hasn't come out of his house for two weeks now!
SpongeBob	Gary? What are you doing at Squidward's? Uh Gare? Can you put Squidward on the phone?  Hold on a second, someone is on the other line.  Hello? Hello!? HELLO!?  Hello?
SpongeBob	Surprise! I figured out you needed a party to help cheer you up! Unfortunately, everybody I tried to invite was busy or sick but don't worry! I used my paper mch skills to fill the party with your favorite person: me!  So what do you think? Happiest memory or what?
SpongeBob	Weee! Gotchya! There you go, little fella.  Say, Patrick. Don't you think that Jellyfish Fields has gotten bigger today?
SpongeBob	Isn't he the cutest little jellyfish you've ever seen.  And he doesn't sting.
SpongeBob	Well, we've given a jellyfish to everyone, except Squidward. I'm sure he doesn't want one.
SpongeBob	Tonight, you'll sleep with me little jelly. Goodnight, jellyfish. Goodnight, Gary! Heh, good night little jelly.  Ah, I can't sleep.  Oh, you want some popcorn? Here ya go.  Hey, hey! Are you okay?
SpongeBob	Huh? That's funny. We just received a whole shipment of mayonnaise.  Patrick?!? What are you doing? Cooking Krabby Patties is my job.
SpongeBob	O...kay?  He's acting weird today.  Hey! There's plenty of mayo back here!  Huh? Is somebody in there?  Monsters! Huh? Squidward and Mr. Krabs! Patrick too!  And some random guy! Huh?  My spatula! It's just like that movie I watched last night! Those things have captured everyone and put them into creepy pods.  Hi, uh, Patrick? I gotta...clean the tables...Patrick. Ha ha...Patrick.
SpongeBob	AH! Random guy!  What am I going to do? All of my friends taken by those Jelly creatures. I can feel their creepy, rope-like tentacles now!
SpongeBob	Well the only thing I know is that they can't stand mayonnaise.
SpongeBob	I hate mayonnaise and mustard.
SpongeBob	.
SpongeBob	Nah! Gasp! Sandy! It's so cold in here the mayonnaise is starting to freeze!
SpongeBob	And that's why we're covered in goo!
SpongeBob	What is going on out there?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, if you want your customers back, we're gonna need to take more extreme measures.
SpongeBob	But you said to go ahead with the plan no matter how hard you fight me.
SpongeBob	Hmm, looks, it's time to pull out the big guns.  No one can resist the sweet sounds of a calliope.
SpongeBob	Wait, Squidward, don't leave. We can't give up yet.
SpongeBob	Krabby Patties, brand new Krabby Patty recipe, all new, all different, all deliciousness, try them for free!
SpongeBob	We did it, Mr. Krabs! We saved the Krusty Krab! All I did was sell the old Krabby Patties, and call them new!
SpongeBob	Ahh. What could go wrong on a beautiful day like this?  Gary, time for breakfast!  The house must be settling.  Oh, that's better.  I can fix this. I'll feed you when I'm done.
SpongeBob	Okay, now that that's taken care of, time to feed Gary.   Oh no! This is worse than I thought!  My door!  AHHHHHHHH!  Patrick! Patrick!  Patrick!
SpongeBob	Patrick, call Sandy! Tell her to get over here fast!
SpongeBob	No, Sandy don't! We must never, ever knock. This pineapple could topple over the slightest gesture.
SpongeBob	So what do you say Mr. Krabs? Will you help?
SpongeBob	Those are all very great ideas, but...
SpongeBob	Yeah, but I like to watch TV in my TV room.
SpongeBob	Sandy, we need to talk.
SpongeBob	It's, uh...
SpongeBob	You all worked very hard.
SpongeBob	Thanks for the futuristic bathroom, Sandy.
SpongeBob	"Oh, Gary, I'm sorry. With all this house ruckus, I completely forgot to feed you. Here you go, buddy.  ""Furnished Pineapple in a Can."" Oh, Gary! You are the best!"
SpongeBob	Catcha later, so long. Bye Bye  Toodaloo! Whoa!
SpongeBob	Could this be one of Plankton's elaborate ruses?
SpongeBob	Hey there. Dry those computer tears. I'm sure you two will get back  together. Plankton just need some time to realize how much he needs you. I mean you guys were made for each other. Well you were made more for him and more specifically by him and now he's built someone with more modern features who's better in every way. There's no- what was my point again?
SpongeBob	Well, you know what cheers me up when I'm feeling down?
SpongeBob	Mop, mop, mop, mopping, mopping, mopping, moooopping, moooopping moopppinnng!
SpongeBob	But, Mr. Krabs I...
SpongeBob	I did go to bed 2 minutes later usual.
SpongeBob	No, Krusty Krab?!
SpongeBob	Well I am not going to allow a mistake like today to happen again. I am going straight to bed!
SpongeBob	You're right Gary! Warm milk puts me right to sleep!
SpongeBob	Aw, yuck! Never mind that Patrick! I need your help desperately! I'm a insomniac! I need to sleep!
SpongeBob	Sounds like me.
SpongeBob	Um, Patrick, that's...
SpongeBob	That's an excellent number...
SpongeBob	Patrick, get serious please!
SpongeBob	Okay... Patrick, How is this gonna-
SpongeBob	Uh oh.. feeling jittery, heart pounding, teeth grinding...  Uh oh.  No, No! Guys, We gotta get to sleep. Well, I guess I just have to let my legs tire out before I can catch up with my weary brain.
SpongeBob	What's this? Another vision?  Why, Why? Oh, Please let me sleep for just 5 minutes!
SpongeBob	Yes sir, SpongeBob reporting for sleeping.
SpongeBob	I know, I just need a quiet place to nap.
SpongeBob	Anything for my bestest buddy. There's no better way. I could've spent my lunch drink.  Ahh.
SpongeBob	Sorry, sir. I got carried away. Patrick and I here are making faces at each other.
SpongeBob	Patrick! Don't even smile. That's considered making a face.
SpongeBob	Look at us. We're okay. Our faces didn't freeze.
SpongeBob	Ay yi yi yi yi yi!
SpongeBob	Awoot duh doo!
SpongeBob	Delightfully wicked, my friend. I call this one...  The Gary. Meow!
SpongeBob	: Mind What? Making Faces? Of course were don't.
SpongeBob	Interesting challenge, but let's raise the stakes even higher. Patrick, I'll bet you can't keep that face all night, while you sleep!
SpongeBob	No Patrick, It's not all right, this means Mr. Krabs was right! Patrick we have a Face Freeze!
SpongeBob	: Hello Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	That'll buy me some time.
SpongeBob	: OK, OK.
SpongeBob	: Oh, dear.
SpongeBob	Hey, have you seen this, Mr. Krabs? My impersonation of a burrito!
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	I just figured you probably want it back.
SpongeBob	Does that mean I can have it?
SpongeBob	But are you...
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Squidward, it's just...  ...it's just that I'm thinking of all the fun I'm going to have with this piece of paper!
SpongeBob	Now I'm...  SpongeBob JunglePants!
SpongeBob	Look, Gary, oral-gami.
SpongeBob	I don't know, what happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?
SpongeBob	Hooray! Hooray! That was great, Squidward. All those wrong notes you played made it sound more original.
SpongeBob	I can't! You made me promise no matter how much you begged, and pleaded, and cried not to give the paper back to you ever.
SpongeBob	Sorry, Squidward, I am sworn to a promise.  Maybe I should get going.
SpongeBob	Okay...  Oh, I get it. You're just testing me. Don't worry, Squidward, I won't let you down. A promise is a promise.
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward, is this still part of the test? Because it's...it's really getting harder and harder to keep my promise.
SpongeBob	Excuse me, did you just say Glove World!?
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	There it is Patrick. Glove World!.
SpongeBob	Glove size fits all.
SpongeBob	Then the rumors are true, you are gonna close Glove World!.
SpongeBob	Goodbye Glove Drop.
SpongeBob	I just don't get it, I mean why? Why must Glove World! close?
SpongeBob	The Ferris Wheel. It's free of it mornings!
SpongeBob	Patrick, it's now or never! You can do this!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I think the time has come for us to accept reality.
SpongeBob	I just wish there was something we can do.
SpongeBob	Then everybody will love it again, and then will have no choice but to keep Glove World! open. Are you with me?
SpongeBob	It's working.
SpongeBob	Excuse me.  Much better.  Ooh.
SpongeBob	Everybody's gone home Patrick. We couldn't fix Glove World!, and now it's over. They're gonna close it, there's nothing we can do.
SpongeBob	Ok, let's get out of the chains. Give me the key.
SpongeBob	Who are you talking to Squidward?
SpongeBob	Uh...you could be sick.
SpongeBob	Squidward. Squidward. Squidward!
SpongeBob	Ah! What is the name of this horrible illness?
SpongeBob	Uh, Squidward. I think the disease is affecting your temper.
SpongeBob	Right away, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Oh this.
SpongeBob	Um, actually no.
SpongeBob	It's Squidward. He's sick.
SpongeBob	Poor Squidward.
SpongeBob	If Mr. Krabs finds out I have the Squid's Disease, he'll send me home, just like Squidward. Wait a second! That's it! Why go home when I have Grandma's down home folk remedies right here.  Grandma always said: If you might be coming down with an illness, just stick your feet in hot water.  Or was it cold water?  Something tells me it wwwasssnn't thhaat either. Of course. It wasn't hot water or cold water! It was boiling oil.  Uh huh. I can definitely feel the medicinal qualities.  Oh no!
SpongeBob	Thank you, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	I... fell ill. Mr. Krabs won't let me work again until I'm better. Well, at least we can spend the day recovering together. After all, misery loves company. Right Squidward?  Squidward?
SpongeBob	Wasn't that great, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
SpongeBob	It's  driving test day!
SpongeBob	Hey Mrs. Puff. How are you feeling?
SpongeBob	I'm sorry! Stop Mrs. Puff! That tickles!
SpongeBob	I see you got the flowers I sent
SpongeBob	Up and at 'em! Y'know what will make you feel better Mrs. Puff? A nice peaceful stroll!
SpongeBob	Hooray!
SpongeBob	Huh? Oh, dear. I think I'm in that fellow's way. Engauge turn signals.Adjust mirrors.Hands at ten and two, and finally floor it.
SpongeBob	What's that Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	Oh, it's a commercial.
SpongeBob	Did you see that, Squidward?  Snail Bites.
SpongeBob	It smells good?
SpongeBob	More treats?
SpongeBob	Don't be modest, Mr. Krabs.  He's responsible for everything at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	I cleaned it this morning.
SpongeBob	Boo! Hiss!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, it's awful. We're all out of buns.
SpongeBob	Uh, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Oh, it's drawing very near.My favorite time of the year. The snow is falling and the cold wind blows.Christmas is almost here.And I know that Santa, Santa. Santa has his jolly little eyes on me! It keeps me warm and filled with glee to know Santa has his eyes on me. I light my house like a Christmas tree. Fa la la la la la la la lee. 'cause Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little...  Eyes on me.
SpongeBob	Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me. He sees everything I do, with his left eye on me and his right eye on you!
SpongeBob	Merry Christmas, Sandy!
SpongeBob	Hey, Plankton! What've you got there?  Hey! Is that a fruitcake dispenser? You don't suppose I could have a piece, do ya?
SpongeBob	Mm-mm.
SpongeBob	No. How could I possibly be angry when my taste buds are swimming in Christmas cheer?
SpongeBob	Nothing loosens up the old pipes like some fruitcake. Dig in!
SpongeBob	Oh boy, a Christmas parade! The perfect occasion to spread some mouthwatering joy. Oh, everyone, try some hot fruitcake today. Eat it all up and you will shout Hooray!!
SpongeBob	Have some fruitcake!
SpongeBob	What's that all about? ] Hey, Patrick! What're you up to?
SpongeBob	More like  will! Gosh, if people don't start acting nicer, Santa's going to fly right past Bikini Bottom this Christmas Eve! I'm gonna need some help.  Squidward!
SpongeBob	Sandy, Sandy! I need your help! It's Christmas Eve and everyone in Bikini Bottom are acting like jerks! You gotta help me find out why.
SpongeBob	What is it, Sandy?
SpongeBob	Uh-huh.
SpongeBob	Ahoy, everybody!
SpongeBob	And not a moment too soon. Santa should be here any minute.
SpongeBob	Naughty list?
SpongeBob	You want Santa, you gotta get through me!
SpongeBob	Oh, it was nothing.
SpongeBob	Don't speak too soon, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Oh, sir, I'm sure that the new Chum Fricassee can't taste better than a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	Gee, Mr. Krabs, it sure was nice of you to hire Squidward back. Especially since he tried to destroy your business and all.
SpongeBob	Oh, there you are, Mr. Krabs! Where have you been?
SpongeBob	When I see that 2%, I think of pie!
SpongeBob	Please accept one of our fliers and consider dining at our fine eating establishment the next time you're feeling hungry.
SpongeBob	Relax, Patrick! It's me! This is just a cost..
SpongeBob	Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	It's cold!
SpongeBob	We left you a present in there!
SpongeBob	Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob	Wow! I better get back to help with the crowd!
SpongeBob	But what if we get hit by a boat?
SpongeBob	Here they come!  Let's go inside! We did it, Mr. Krabs! Soon, you'll have more customers than you'll know what to do with!
SpongeBob	And I'm gonna be the first signature. There and how about you Squidward? Could we count on your support?  Squidward?
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff, don't you care what happens to Mr. Krabs? Squidward? Gary? Me?
SpongeBob	Excuse me, sir. Would you like to sign a petition to save the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	Delicious!
SpongeBob	But I can't help it think that I somehow had a hand in your misery. Or at least a spatula. Nobody would sign a petition to bulldoze the Krusty Krab unless you pay them. And who would be loaned down enough to do that?
SpongeBob	Stand your ground, Mr. Krabs! We are right behind you, right, Squidward?  Squidward?
SpongeBob	Yippee! I'm rich! Look Patrick, eight gold doubloons!
SpongeBob	Take a break and play around with us.
SpongeBob	My turn.  One, two, three, four.  Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way.  Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.
SpongeBob	Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, it is late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	But, Mr...
SpongeBob	Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate!
SpongeBob	Okie dokie, then.
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has...  Which way captain?
SpongeBob	I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.
SpongeBob	He's not here.
SpongeBob	Patrick, you're not suppose to look at the map.
SpongeBob	You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?
SpongeBob	Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map.
SpongeBob	We found it together. So we deserve a share!
SpongeBob	And one for all.
SpongeBob	Wow!
SpongeBob	Should we take it from the top?
SpongeBob	It sure was nice of that Colonel Carper guy to let us borrow his entire wall of sound equipment! Wasn't it Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Sorry sir.
SpongeBob	No, can't you hear them Squidward? They're saying Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward...
SpongeBob	MR. KRABS!!!
SpongeBob	Squidward! Are you okay?
SpongeBob	Don't you see? Mr. Krabs needs us terribly! We got it in us to be a huge success! You and I can't settle for less! I promise myself not to shed this tear!
SpongeBob	Don't cry Mr. Krabs. Here!  You can have the money for Gary's college fund if that would......help...
SpongeBob	Let's check it out!
SpongeBob	Wow!
SpongeBob	Whoa!
SpongeBob	We want to join your extreme spots team, as you can see, we're also covered head to toe in the most extreme of spots.
SpongeBob	Ready Patrick? On your mark, get set, jump rope!
SpongeBob	You're face isn't leaking. You're just sweating from all the exercise.
SpongeBob	I think I do. Is fighting extreme?
SpongeBob	Well there is one sport that Patrick's an expert at.
SpongeBob	Oh my. It's time to go home. Squidward, what are you still doing here?
SpongeBob	Wow!
SpongeBob	That's it, Sandy! You did it!
SpongeBob	Raw!
SpongeBob	For 30 seconds.
SpongeBob	Oh no! I forgot my camera!
SpongeBob	You bet ya!
SpongeBob	Ouch!
SpongeBob	Got it! You OK?  Do you smell soup?
SpongeBob	Got it! So uh how do you stop?
SpongeBob	I don't know, Sandy. It is getting kinda dangerous.
SpongeBob	Um, I think I smell Gary's sandbox better go clean it. Now!  I think you broke a record today, Gary. World's Stinkiest Litter box! Eww!  I'm worried about Sandy. She's got record-breaking fever!
SpongeBob	Oh hey, Sandy.
SpongeBob	What's the matter? You seem so sad.
SpongeBob	Oof!  Ooh, I gotta run. I have patties to flip,  but I sure hope you figure your problem out. Think about it.
SpongeBob	Order up! Another Krabby Patty for the gentleman.
SpongeBob	You've intercepted a recipe for toasted coral bits. Don't you think you're going a little overboard with this Patrick-Man thing?
SpongeBob	What now, Patrick?
SpongeBob	What's your next exciting adventure, Patrick-Man?
SpongeBob	I'm beginning to sense a pattern here.Gary, are you trying to tell me something? Could it be that what you need is a new chew toy?I thought so.
SpongeBob	No thanks, just had breakfast. We're here to buy Gary a new toy.
SpongeBob	That's brilliant! What will they think of next?
SpongeBob	Gary? Gary!Hey, where'd you come from? I wonder if Gary would like this ball. Ga-I guess you do.
SpongeBob	OK, boy, go and get it! Go and get it! Go and get it! Fetch!
SpongeBob	Gary, dinner time! Gary!Gary?OK, that's just creepy. Gary, I think you need to spend some time away from this ball.This isn't helping your case.
SpongeBob	Good morning, Gary! I hope you're not still mad at me. Gary? The ball!I will not tolerate this disobedience, Gary!Gary, I'm not playing around, you had better show yourself this instant.OK, get down here! Hm.Gary, give me that ball.C'mon! Hnn!

Together. Without me. Goodbye.
SpongeBob	Yippee!Look, we're closer than ever.Come on, Gary, let's go home.Do you smell something burning?Hey, look, isn't that your ball?
SpongeBob	Where are we going, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Yes sir! Worthy and ready!
SpongeBob	Oh! That's right! Heh, how silly of me! Mr. Krabs' right.  Milkshaking has changed over the years.
SpongeBob	Um...the printer ran out of ink?
SpongeBob	What's wrong Captain Frostymug?
SpongeBob	NO! I'm not leaving you behind!
SpongeBob	Gasp! My milkshake license! If only if were this easy to get a boating license!
SpongeBob	Babies don't talk like that Patrick. They talk like...
SpongeBob	Ok Squidie din din is ready. Where is our little miracle?  Patrick how could you!  There! My little darling. Were supposed to protect his head remember.  Ok Squidie I made your favorite. Grilled Tar Tar with a algae thin of bread.  Here it comes, open wide.  Come on little buddy you got to grow up to be big and crankie like the airplane in the hanger.  See Patrick you sometimes you have to out-think the baby.  You know Patrick maybe...
SpongeBob	This game's kinda dangerous.
SpongeBob	You said it! I'm exhausted! Hey, Patrick. I have to go to work. Would you mind holding Squidw....  I guess it's just you and me, little fella.
SpongeBob	All settled into your work station, I see. Maybe you're ready for your Krusty duties after all! Now let's make it official!  Oh, how silly of me!  Squiddy needs a high chair!  And duct tape!  Oh, Squiddy! I'm so proud of you! Just yesterday, you were drooling all over me! And look at you now, working and sitting in a big boy seat!
SpongeBob	Aye-aye, Mr. Krabs.  You know what to do.  Thanks, Squiddy. I can also count on yaa...  Will this be for here or to goo?  You really need to work on your penmanship, Squiddy.
SpongeBob	Yes, sir! Yes, sir!  Oh.
SpongeBob	Sorry!  Ok, Squiddy! Hold still! And, oh, boy!
SpongeBob	Yes.
SpongeBob	I got it.
SpongeBob	Right away, ma-am.  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I have this under control...
SpongeBob	Ward!
SpongeBob	There's an urchin in the kitchen!
SpongeBob	THIS IS TERRIBLE!!! You should never put that much ketchup on a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	Aye aye captain! Here goes nothing...
SpongeBob	Cactus.
SpongeBob	Spray can.
SpongeBob	Gasp! It's beautiful!
SpongeBob	So where do we release them?
SpongeBob	Is this far enough?
SpongeBob	Another funtastic day at Glove World!.
SpongeBob	Fifty-cents.
SpongeBob	Thanks, mister.
SpongeBob	Cool!
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick. We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know.  Maybe we should wait for one more.
SpongeBob	Well, at least the line is moving.  Tartar sauce!!
SpongeBob	The next bus...  to bikini...  Bottom.
SpongeBob	This isn't your average everyday darkness. This is... darkness. Hey...  if I close my eyes it doesn't seem so dark.
SpongeBob	Hiii... yah!Squidward! Sorry, buddy, didn't see you. Are you okay?
SpongeBob	Okey dokey, Squidward! Stop on by later if you change your mind about the karate.
SpongeBob	Squidward? What's wrong?
SpongeBob	"Hey I should've named you ""Scary"" eh buddy?"
SpongeBob	Hmm... hmm! Hmm... yes! You show potential young student! But with the rubbery arms and the doughiness in this area you obviously have our work cut out for us.
SpongeBob	That's it.
SpongeBob	This is a tough one Squidward. Don't feel bad if you can't do it.
SpongeBob	: Hey! Grocery boy! It is me! A big, scary miscreant! Now hand over that sack of groceries before things get ugly!
SpongeBob	Hey Sandy? I don't remember this being a part of my training.
SpongeBob	This guy's been... ka-rah-tayed!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs arranged for me to work here on weekends. He wants me to keep an eye on you!
SpongeBob	Oh uh, I'll be right over here.
SpongeBob	A jailbreak!? I got to warn Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Oh Mr. Krabs! They're almost here!
SpongeBob	Well then, let's get cleaning.
SpongeBob	Fax coming through, boss.
SpongeBob	Clear! Clear!
SpongeBob	Well, judging from its diameter and vermillion color, I am looking at the handle cap for a vintage Grill Force 700 Spatula.
SpongeBob	That sounds thrilling! But I do need to hurry back to work.
SpongeBob	I'm back, Mr. Krabs. Did I miss anything?
SpongeBob	Hmm. I must be hearing things, 'cause Mr. Krabs says spatulas can't talk.
SpongeBob	Time to focus.
SpongeBob	Orders, ahoy!
SpongeBob	Well, you can really do wonders, SizzleMaster. Today was great.
SpongeBob	Well, I'm not going to be grilling tonight, but thank you.
SpongeBob	You're such a joyful being, SizzleMaster. Here's that litter box you said you'd clean.
SpongeBob	Wow! I'm three hours early to work. Thanks to you, SizzleMaster.
SpongeBob	That is true. Well, I guess I can trust you with my grill while I take a brief respite.
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah. Okay. It's just over here in the safe.
SpongeBob	Aye, aye! Okay SizzleMaster, the first ingredient is... five gallons combustible cooking oil.
SpongeBob	Must be Explosive Patty Wednesday, eh, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Hmm, I wonder why we're not sinking to the bottom of Goo Lagoon.  Patrick, you're floating!
SpongeBob	Oh, sorry, Squidward. We're riding on these cool  goo bubbles. They're floating out of Goo Lagoon.
SpongeBob	But just look at all the cool stuff it can do.  You can make a hat.  Or a beard.
SpongeBob	I'm on TV!
SpongeBob	Look, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Whoa!
SpongeBob	So what do we do now, Sandy? That thing is headed straight for downtown Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	That's weird. It's like that bubble has a mind of its own.
SpongeBob	There, there Sandy.
SpongeBob	Hey, you! Yeah, you! Hold it right there, mister!
SpongeBob	There goes a real hero. He gave his life so we could stay clean.  Oh, no, he's coming back!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I'm done watering down the ketchup. Do you want me to... Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? MR. KRABS!
SpongeBob	Oh, hi Pearl! Is Mr. Krabs here?
SpongeBob	Don't worry! I'll find him!
SpongeBob	What? Where are you?
SpongeBob	Well, I don't see a chimney. But we could try getting in through a roof vent. If only we had a way to scale this wall.
SpongeBob	This vent will surely lead us to Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Ah, careful Patrick. Use finesse.
SpongeBob	Hi Squidward! Bet you can't guess what movie we're gonna see!
SpongeBob	I wish we had a flashlight.
SpongeBob	Wow. Uh, what time is it?
SpongeBob	Phew. We made it.
SpongeBob	Oh, hey, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Patrick! Are you okay?
SpongeBob	You just said.
SpongeBob	(SpongeBob & Patrick push stuff over to SpongeBob bedroom door) Get everything?
SpongeBob	And here you go.  Now where were we? Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob	No!  Mr. Krabs! There was an unsatisfied customer! Why don't we serve the Rusty on Rye anymore?
SpongeBob	I may be able to get that recipe after all. I just need to call in a favor.  Hi Patrick! SpongeBob here.  Yeah, the one with square pants. Mm-hmm. Hey, listen, can you meet me after work? I need your help with something.  Your best friend SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Rusty Rickets!
SpongeBob	Oh right. You're a ghost. Hmm... how about you just show me how to make one?
SpongeBob	Spackle, shellac.
SpongeBob	Hey! I didn't summon you guys!
SpongeBob	Hey! That is private property! Maybe you guys should leave!
SpongeBob	Hi, Mr. Krabs--
SpongeBob	Wow! That's the longest I've held my breath: three whole seconds. I'm gonna try for five seconds next.
SpongeBob	He's the greatest undersea athlete to originate from above the wet and briney.  And he's been shattering records all over, holding his breath as he walks the ocean floor. I want tobe just like Kenny the Cat.  That's what he does: he walks like that and holds his breath like that. Kenny is a sensationality.  Haven't you noticed my recent lettuce customization?
SpongeBob	Huh. You haven't seen him in your wallet?
SpongeBob	I shall do my Krustiest, sir.
SpongeBob	Well, aren't cats and squirrels basically the same thing?
SpongeBob	Uh-huh.
SpongeBob	Patrick, have you ever gazed up into the starry night and see Kenny the Cat's face?
SpongeBob	Hey, buddy. Check it out.
SpongeBob	Kenny!
SpongeBob	Well, I'd best get back manning the grill.
SpongeBob	There's no room for thoughts now. Only for tears.
SpongeBob	Yes, really.
SpongeBob	Hey, maybe weshould show our fine guest a little more hospitality, hmm?
SpongeBob	Already done, sir!
SpongeBob	Not if you wear gloves, it doesn't.  Mind if I take this to Patrick after work, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	The Yeti Krab?
SpongeBob	Or the Yeti Krab will smell our laziness and eat us!
SpongeBob	Squidward, Mr. Krabs would never make up something like that!
SpongeBob	You are not gonna believe this! There's a Yeti Krab at table 7! And he is sniffing out the lazy!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Squidward! Just burnishing the ceiling!
SpongeBob	Lost it?  Lost it?  What a silly thing to say!
SpongeBob	Guys, do you hear that?
SpongeBob	Done!
SpongeBob	Goin' over to Sandy's place.  Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place.
SpongeBob	All right then. Let's make one of your tree dome.
SpongeBob	Uhh, Sandy?  Surf's up Sandy!
SpongeBob	We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!
SpongeBob	Homesick, huh?  Almost there.
SpongeBob	I don't get it, Patrick! What's wrong with Sandy?
SpongeBob	Patrick, she sang that song from her heart. She really misses Texas.
SpongeBob	Shh! Don't spoil the surprise!
SpongeBob	What?! Now?! You can't! I mean we...
SpongeBob	No, no! Wait! Sandy!  I can't believe she's gone.
SpongeBob	Look Patrick, I'm Texas! Duh, howdy, y'all! Howdy y'all!
SpongeBob	No, I'm Texas!
SpongeBob	Run faster, Patrick!
SpongeBob	It's a party!
SpongeBob	Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags.
SpongeBob	Ooh-wah!  Oh!
SpongeBob	But how about if I work for free?
SpongeBob	No! Not that! Anything but that!
SpongeBob	Oh, Mr. Krabs feels he doesn't need me anymore.
SpongeBob	Gee, I'm sorry. Why don't you come inside?
SpongeBob	F-f-f-f-f-f-f...
SpongeBob	Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have to wor-- oh. Yeah, okay.
SpongeBob	Uh-uh.
SpongeBob	I got fired. Now I'm fun-employed.  Whoo-hoo.
SpongeBob	Thanks, Patrick.  It's time to rejoin the workforce. Gainful employment, here I come!  Yah! I'm ready! Whoo-hoo!  I'm ready, I'm ready for a new job, for a new job, I'm ready for a new job; I'm ready
SpongeBob	Hmm. There's something not quite right about this food, but I'm not sure what it is.  Aha!
SpongeBob	Aah! But, Mr. Krabs, why?
SpongeBob	Excuse me, Mr. Pizza man.  You need a fry-cook?
SpongeBob	Almost done! But I did change the recipe a bit.
SpongeBob	Like I need his dumb job, anyway. I hope his pepperoni falls off.  Hey, taco man, may I have a job,
SpongeBob	Aah!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Gary, you must be starving.  Don't worry gare-bear.  I'll open up a can of Snailpo for you.  Oh, no.  We're all out of Snailpo.  We'll just have to make our own.  Perfect!
SpongeBob	Only satisfaction.  If only my bosses liked my cooking as much as you two do.  I mean three.  Hello. Hmm. That's odd. I could've sworn I heard a knock at the door.
SpongeBob	I'm pretty sure this is illegal. What am I gonna do now?
SpongeBob	What?  Parmesan-crusted breadstick!  Whoa!
SpongeBob	Krabby Patty! You saved me!  Well, here we go again.
SpongeBob	Yes.  Yes, I do.
SpongeBob	The Krusty Krab is back in business!
SpongeBob	I was in such a hurry, I almost forgot my pants.
SpongeBob	I don't follow.
SpongeBob	Oh no, now we're only going to be 14 minutes early for work!  Oh, there's got to be a shortcut around here somewhere!
SpongeBob	Well, I guess this is where we part ways. But I can't wait to see your face when you get to work and I'm already there!  That's the face! That's the look!    First you do a zig, then you take a little zag, that's how find you a shortcut! Crawl underneath the fence, struggle through a bush, and that's how you find a shortcut!  Huh?
SpongeBob	The Krabby Krust?!  Is that the name of a restaurant?
SpongeBob	I thought you didn't know where the Krusty Krab was! Oh, what do I do now?
SpongeBob	Not good. I think I took a wrong turn at the abandoned sofa. All there is around here are broken fire hydrants. What should I do?!
SpongeBob	Looking for a dime in this abandoned sofa!
SpongeBob	Ooh, you drive a pedicab?
SpongeBob	No! Over the cliff!  Through the toxic runoff!  Make a right at the disease-filled sewer pipe!  Face-first into this fetid muck! Over the garbage pile! Fall down this mountain of broken glass! Over the excruciatingly sharp razor-wire!  Up this massive hill!  That's...the Krusty Krab! And I'm still 2 minutes early!  I made it! I made it!  Oh, random Krusty Krab patrients! How I've missed out!  Oh, how I've missed your youthful faces!  I missed the bathroom, too!   But most of all, I missed you, choking guy!   Patrick? How did you get here?
SpongeBob	Aye-aye, sir!
SpongeBob	Oh, about $100 a semester.
SpongeBob	You know, Mr. Krabs, at boating school, Mrs. Puff...
SpongeBob	It does?
SpongeBob	Rookie mistake, right?
SpongeBob	Patrick's house!
SpongeBob	Hey, look, Mr. Krabs. I'm driving!
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob	Oh, my gosh.
SpongeBob	Uh, yeah, some of it.
SpongeBob	Whoa! My first real traffic ticket.
SpongeBob	Whatcha doing?
SpongeBob	Okay, quick survey. Are you busy busy, or just busy?
SpongeBob	Somebody like me?
SpongeBob	Of course I'll go to the opening with you!
SpongeBob	It's me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Oh.
SpongeBob	You hold on to one end of the rope and you drag it behind you like a sea snake is chasing you like this. Wanna play?
SpongeBob	: Here's your executive treatment!
SpongeBob	: You know what that makes you?
SpongeBob	: Ok, but who are you?  No seriously. Who are you?
SpongeBob	At this point it would be ketchuping up the water.
SpongeBob	Well, I don't know Mr. Krabs.  I guess it might affect his productivity-
SpongeBob	See, look! He's already perking up!
SpongeBob	Here's one!
SpongeBob	Oh boy! Facing painting! Great idea, Mr. Krabs.  Ahh. Here, let me try!
SpongeBob	Aww!
SpongeBob	Well. Eh.
SpongeBob	Aww!
SpongeBob	Who needs them? Right, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Ooh. The ghost of mayonnaise bad! That really scares people.
SpongeBob	100% sure, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Well, if it's good enough for Mr. Krabs, it's good enough for me.
SpongeBob	Simmy, look out! There's a candied pen heading straight for your eye due to my act of swatting it away without first considering the trajectory! Oh, I wish I could give my words out faster, but everything's in slow motion!
SpongeBob	I guess my mind was all sharp from the relaxing fun I had at your company picnic, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Ooh, I do!
SpongeBob	Chafed!
SpongeBob	Ah, I tell you Gary, there is nothing better on a sunny day than a fresh walk.
SpongeBob	Aww. Come here, little fella. I won't hurt ya.
SpongeBob	Aww. He wants to play.
SpongeBob	It is important to keep baby snails warm at all times.
SpongeBob	Uh-huh. Perfect temperature. Time to eat my little snaily poos.
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Dani.
SpongeBob	Uh, you're welcome?
SpongeBob	Yes?
SpongeBob	Down, Vince! You leave Electric Ronnie alone! Mr. Buster, get off that shelf! Nothing today, thank you! Bye, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Don't worry. I'm taking very good care of all my snails.
SpongeBob	Work? But I've found my life's work. Taking care of wayward snails.
SpongeBob	No, no, you dirty boy. You need a bath.
SpongeBob	Oh, the bad men want to take you away from me. But I won't let them.
SpongeBob	Hello.
SpongeBob	So long! I'm gonna miss you guys. Especially you, Seor Poopus.  I mean Seorita Esmerelda.
SpongeBob	Patrick! Patrick!  Don't worry! I'm going to adopt you!
SpongeBob	But just look at him go!
SpongeBob	Tummies! Ha-ha-ha
SpongeBob	Okay, i'll get right on it.
SpongeBob	The taste, Patrick,  Remember the taste!
SpongeBob	Yeah, that sounds right to me!
SpongeBob	Well, I think Patrick could make up a game.
SpongeBob	It's beautiful!
SpongeBob	Driver's license! Driver's license! But what does that mean?
SpongeBob	Yeah, play by the rules.
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Five. One, two, three, four, five. Um, I think I'll...
SpongeBob	Two.  Silly face! Silly face!

SpongeBob	Beep beep!
SpongeBob	That's my ice cream cone!
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	Sure!
SpongeBob	Did you see that, Plankton? That guy found some buried treasure!
SpongeBob	No it's not!
SpongeBob	Wait, Plankton, give me another chance!
SpongeBob	I'll do better than that!
SpongeBob	You didn't tell me everyone would leave.
SpongeBob	What happened?
SpongeBob	Volleyball, anyone?  Service! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch!
SpongeBob	Hurray for Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Got it!
SpongeBob	I knew I missed something.
SpongeBob	I hear and obey my liege.
SpongeBob	This will go down good!  Oops.
SpongeBob	"You didn't say ""not the safe""!"
SpongeBob	Pull my finger.
SpongeBob	Look at these strange etchings, Squidward.
SpongeBob	It's stuck on the pipe!
SpongeBob	Hey, look! There's the safe!
SpongeBob	Yay! Whoo hoo!
SpongeBob	Good going, Squidward! You're tickling him! I'll help ya!
SpongeBob	Oh, look! You found the safe!
SpongeBob	Oh, cold knees!
SpongeBob	You're pulling my leg, sir, I don't look like a man! Do I?
SpongeBob	Ohh! I could get used to this job! Hey Squidward what's on sale this week?
SpongeBob	What do I do when the register is $2000 dollars short?
SpongeBob	Nothing like that, Mr. Krabs. I just don't think I'm maitre' d material.
SpongeBob	AH! Shrimp! Oh, dry cleaning, and one hour!
SpongeBob	Hey, I think I'm getting the hang of this!
SpongeBob	Breeches?  Oh, oh, these old things?
SpongeBob	Boy, would I! I love parties!
SpongeBob	Wait, what's that?  The Mermaidman and Barnacleboy movie is opening tonight! Wow! I totally forgot!  Hey guys, I got an idea! Let's all go to the Mermaidman movie!
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward?
SpongeBob	My pants say yes, yes, yes, but my heart says no! I want to see the Mermaidman movie!
SpongeBob	What? Rated for those in knee-highs only? Doh! I hate these pants! [  Get off!  Oh!, now I know I'm an adult because I've been ripped off by these defective pants!
SpongeBob	It's okay! I'm a sponge, remember?
SpongeBob	Aah! Thanks, Larry!
SpongeBob	Squishy.
SpongeBob	Yes, sir!
SpongeBob	I don't know, Larry. I'm not good at lifting things.
SpongeBob	I'll be there!
SpongeBob	Always be hydrating.
SpongeBob	Yeah, I hope you have some glue for my because I am ripped!
SpongeBob	Gee, Larry. You've really let yourself go.
SpongeBob	Oh, he'll be here. Don't worry. Larry made me the man I am today.
SpongeBob	And don't forget. Always be hydrated. That means drink plenty of water.
SpongeBob	I hear ya, Larry. I just wanna get back to the Krusty...
SpongeBob	You mean a brug?
SpongeBob	Larry, your brug was so super strong, it took the water muscles right out of me!
SpongeBob	What do we have to do?
SpongeBob	Would you like to have some natural fun?
SpongeBob	Oh, can I have an A+?
SpongeBob	I got an A+!
SpongeBob	Sandy!
SpongeBob	Aye-aye, Captain Sandy.
SpongeBob	You're in charge.
SpongeBob	Three.
SpongeBob	Ok, boss man. How do you wanna do it?
SpongeBob	You're the boss!
SpongeBob	What's that?
SpongeBob	But Patrick, I...
SpongeBob	Alright, I'll rub your feet.
SpongeBob	Alright, I will!
SpongeBob	Aahh!  Enjoying that ice cream, Patrick?
SpongeBob	No, you open it!
SpongeBob	Aww, Patrick. Don't be so hard on yourself. It was the experiment's fault that you were such a jerk.
SpongeBob	Sea bears aren't weapons, Plankton.  They're furry buckets of love.  See?  And what do sea bears love more than tummy tickles?  Jellyfish honey!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I am gonna stretch this dollar until it begs for mercy!  No... disrespect for your new bride.
SpongeBob	It's a shame Plankton couldn't be here.
SpongeBob	It was Patrick, but now we will let peace prevail. Let us sign this treaty, and our thumbs will live in harmony.
SpongeBob	Well, you guys are stupendous customers.
SpongeBob	Five. But thanks for being on top of the situation. You're a fantastic boss.
SpongeBob	No, Squidward, I do not have a thumbs-up for you.
SpongeBob	Hey, Sandy, I'm giving your outfit two thumbs-up.
SpongeBob	You got the right stuff, golden boys.
SpongeBob	Well, I happen to think you can never give too many thumbs-up.
SpongeBob	Ah.  Whoo, I'm giving away thumbs-up today.
SpongeBob	Oh, this feels great.
SpongeBob	How's it looking, Dr. Manfish?
SpongeBob	Aye aye, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm glad it's you. Better than some weird stranger, right?
SpongeBob	Waiting for autumn.
SpongeBob	Sandy? Sandy! Sandy come back!  I need you to help me open this jar of peanut butter!  Enough sitting around feeling sorry for myself!
SpongeBob	Thumb war.
SpongeBob	Oh Patrick!
SpongeBob	Hmm, maybe I could use a little music to make my work even more fun!
SpongeBob	Well, goodnight Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Wow.
SpongeBob	Yay! I mean, hey, new friends.
SpongeBob	Well, I guess so.
SpongeBob	Um, you know maybe we should let it slide, there are plenty of clubs in the sea.
SpongeBob	Well I'm glad that's all cleared up.
SpongeBob	I was just caught up in the moment, I just love making new friends.
SpongeBob	I'm ready!
SpongeBob	A troupe? What do you mean?
SpongeBob	But what about the club? The bouncer said you destroyed the place.
SpongeBob	Your right Squidward, Gary, lay down some tunes!
SpongeBob	Ooh, leave it to the sponge. Hey yo.
SpongeBob	Ooh! Should I put my face on the glass?
SpongeBob	Aw...But I'd like some more fruit punch.
SpongeBob	But I feel great today.
SpongeBob	What's your name, handsome stranger?
SpongeBob	How about Squidward?
SpongeBob	OK. Thanks.
SpongeBob	Hey, you don't look so good. Can I take you home? Where do you live?
SpongeBob	You gotta help him! I think he's sick or something.
SpongeBob	Fade away? All my brand new friends?! Nooooooooo! They can't! [] No! Don't disappear!
SpongeBob	Hey, those imitations were my friends.
SpongeBob	What's happening, Patrick, you going on a hike?
SpongeBob	Aw, don't worry, Patrick, you can move in with me. We'll be roommates!
SpongeBob	Built a house.
SpongeBob	Ready for work, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Gee, I didn't know being homeless was so expensive.
SpongeBob	How many's a lot?
SpongeBob	Ack! Guten morgan! My name is SpongeBob! (Ach! Guten morgen! Mein Name ist SpongeBob!)
SpongeBob	Well, hello, Gerhard, I used to live here. Just stopped by to visit my old home.
SpongeBob	Kerglooginpfiefer, that's my favorite! Uh, what's your wife's name?
SpongeBob	I have heard so much about your kerglooginpfiefer mit schlusinberry klabber sauz! Can't wait to try it.
SpongeBob	Shhh! The Fishtrap children are gonna sing!
SpongeBob	Squidward!? What are you doing in the Fishtraps' house?
SpongeBob	Alright, Patrick! On the count of three! One...two...three!
SpongeBob	Wake up, Gary.
SpongeBob	No more food.  Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells.  April Fools!  There ya go, pal!
SpongeBob	Yeah, but he told us to tell you...
SpongeBob	Wait, Squidward!  It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!
SpongeBob	April Fools!  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?
SpongeBob	Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up!  Here you go.
SpongeBob	You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one!
SpongeBob	Whooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!  Whoa! Blblblblblblblblblblblbl...
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	But I couldn't...
SpongeBob	I promise.
SpongeBob	You're right, Gary, all this cloud-watching is making me hungry too. Ooh, look at that big one, Gary! It's getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and
SpongeBob	Let's see what's inside.
SpongeBob	Cookies with fortunes that actually come true? We have to share these with everybody!
SpongeBob	Don't you see, Mr. Krabs, the fortunes in those cookies are real. Can't we share them with everyone?
SpongeBob	Time for a refill.
SpongeBob	If the cookie says it's true, then it's true. Horribly, terribly, truthfully, true!
SpongeBob	Leave it to me Mr. Krabs. I'll make sure Plankton gets his so you won't get yours.  Hot stuff comin' through!
SpongeBob	Whoa.
SpongeBob	Rocky road, unlike our friendship, which is a smooth avenue and will never have any bumps.
SpongeBob	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I have a slogan!
SpongeBob	Oh, me, me!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, are you changing the secret Krabby Patty formula?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Making Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	Fired?
SpongeBob	Yeah, but what if someone wants a Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob	I'm going to a partya party to celebrate my friend's upcoming 400th commercial.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Aww.
SpongeBob	I guess you could help out the animatronic Squidward. There's something about him that seems a little off.
SpongeBob	Patrick, there's something weird about these Frozen Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	Welcome to the original Krusty
SpongeBob	See? They're all just fakes.  Everything here is a fake!
SpongeBob	Krabby Patties aren't made with sand! They're made with love.
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	Missed you.
SpongeBob	Well, Patrick, you're just gonna have to listen to your heart... and your stomach.
SpongeBob	The frozen ones are, but these are made fresh.
SpongeBob	Nothing, we're not selling them.
SpongeBob	Hey!
SpongeBob	I'd say you've certainly got a real nutmare on your hands.
SpongeBob	Oh, hey there, Shalmon. Uh, my name is SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Wow. It's coming in great.
SpongeBob	Wow! Patrick would wanna try this.
SpongeBob	Oh no! The nuts stopped!
SpongeBob	Sandy, wait! I don't think that's what your tree needs!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, think of it now as a bulletin board for the community. A place where a yearning populous can express themselves freely.
SpongeBob	Let's see what other nice people are saying.
SpongeBob	Dear P-Star7, I'm so sorry you had a less than stellar experience at the Krusty Krab and we promise to do better in future. Signed, Fry-Banshee139. Crisis averted.
SpongeBob	If only I could figure out who this P-Star7 is.
SpongeBob	No, now the other side is wobbly. I'll just even it up a little here.
SpongeBob	Has P-Star7 responded to my nice note yet?
SpongeBob	Oh, why did you have to say that?
SpongeBob	Not good. He said that the Krusty Krab made him feel dark and empty inside.
SpongeBob	He said that?!
SpongeBob	People, can't you see what's happened? This bulletin board has become a bullying board!
SpongeBob	We have to find out who this P-Star7 is! Gentlemen, I propose a stakeout!
SpongeBob	So that's what happens to the ketchup stains.
SpongeBob	So, when you said that Krabby Patties reminded you of old baseball gloves, you really meant that they gave you the feeling of your carefree youth.
SpongeBob	Whoo! Food Con! Wait, what's a Food Con?
SpongeBob	This is the best day ever!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	The world's second biggest lump is only 50 miles away! We gotta see it!
SpongeBob	Peep!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?  Blink if you're alive.
SpongeBob	Patrick, are you ok?
SpongeBob	Aww. Hey, little fella.
SpongeBob	No, we can't do that! I know we're all hungry, but we must stay focused! Remember Food Con! Remember the cornucopia!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you. I'm just hungry and tired and I feel like I'm all alone doing the right thing and I...
SpongeBob	Pew, it smells really bad in there.
SpongeBob	Nature Patties!
SpongeBob	No! I'm doing this for your own good! I'm protecting you all from yourselves!
SpongeBob	What about Food Con?
SpongeBob	No! I made a vow! I will not eat you!
SpongeBob	You're all not eating the patty!
SpongeBob	Oh, excuse me, sir. That's not the real Krabby...
SpongeBob	All alone? No one to talk to? Why not write to a total stranger? Connect with other Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Pen Pals Today! Oh, I've never had a pen pal!
SpongeBob	Nah, it's just a little slime.
SpongeBob	Gary, my pen pal thinks I can fly!
SpongeBob	Time to make Pen Pal's wish come true with a tiny white lie!
SpongeBob	Good thinking, Gary.  Sandy will know just what to do.
SpongeBob	I lied!  I lied! I lied! I lied! I lied! I lied!
SpongeBob	Well, there was this big misunderstanding and now my pen pal thinks I can fly! And I don't think I ever mean it, but now I have to! He doesn't see me fly and I don't know how! If I don't fly, he'll die disappointed! I made a horrible mistake, Sandy! Please help!
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm good.
SpongeBob	Oh, hi Gary.
SpongeBob	Hey, you must be Pen Pal!
SpongeBob	My heart is full too, Pen Pal.  My heart is full too.
SpongeBob	No, it's still not that.
SpongeBob	Whoo-hoo! I'm flying! Yee-haw!
SpongeBob	"See? It says, ""I wish I could watch you fly because I am dying!"""
SpongeBob	Ah, something's wrong with the plane! Here, take the controls!
SpongeBob	Whew! We ran out of gas.
SpongeBob	Huh?  No, no, no, no, no, no!
SpongeBob	Good luck, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Oh, uh, yes. It's a very nighty-night for a walkie.
SpongeBob	Now remember, Gary. I'm entrusting you with the secret formula.
SpongeBob	Gary, I'm home!
SpongeBob	Gary, did you do this?
SpongeBob	I'd better get you to the vet.
SpongeBob	Uh, me make Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	You know, you really ought to do your own homework. It's the only way you'll learn.
SpongeBob	Yeah. The only two people who didn't show up are Mr. Krabs and Plankton.  Let me have that diploma!
SpongeBob	Gee, why is Mr. Krabs so crabby today?
SpongeBob	Let's put the past behind us and start all over!
SpongeBob	And he's the man who brought you the Double Krabby Patty. And the Krabby Patty with cheese. And the Bratty Patty for kids.
SpongeBob	I know you'll come back to us, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	I'm calling the local Krusty Krab right now.
SpongeBob	Um, I know where he is.
SpongeBob	Well, somebody has to step up, fight that monster, and become captain! And that somebody is me!
SpongeBob	Uh, uh. The monster ate him. We need a captain and that's you! Isn't that right?
SpongeBob	We're begging you! Please!
SpongeBob	Okay, here goes!
SpongeBob	A tree?
SpongeBob	What's the matter, Patrick?
SpongeBob	That's it! I'm taking you to the dentist, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Thank you!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick! Sit!
SpongeBob	Aww. Coochie coo!
SpongeBob	Yeah! Tooth Island! It's where the Tooth Fairy takes all the baby teeth that are left under pillows.
SpongeBob	Hmm. My friendship sense is tingling. Patrick must be in trouble.
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I've been your friend for a long time. I would never lie to you. You need Dr. Mundane's help so you could get your tooth to the Tooth Fairy.
SpongeBob	Patrick, they weren't mine.
SpongeBob	Patrick, don't you think your baby tooth wants to see all his old friends on Tooth Island?
SpongeBob	You don't believe there's a Tooth Fairy? Well, follow me and I'll show ya.
SpongeBob	Of course.
SpongeBob	Open wide, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula!  Okay, I'm ready!
SpongeBob	Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob	Actually, I've got two.
SpongeBob	How you feeling?
SpongeBob	I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge.
SpongeBob	So, uhh, what do you think?
SpongeBob	And my friends?
SpongeBob	Wait, Neptune! I have another idea!
SpongeBob	Your turn.
SpongeBob	"I'm sorry, Patrick. I'm just so bored playing ""Stick in a Cup."""
SpongeBob	No, I want it!
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick. Just let me flip your lid so I can attach the propeller directly to your brain.
SpongeBob	Now, you do me!
SpongeBob	Eye bump!
SpongeBob	Hey, where's Squidward? I'm sure I saw him in here.
SpongeBob	Yes! We're gonna beat him, Patrick! We're gonna win!
SpongeBob	Okay, don't panic, Patrick. We'll find them. Just take it easy. Take it easy! PATRICK, TAKE IT EASY!
SpongeBob	I've found mine too!
SpongeBob	Ew! Give me that!
SpongeBob	Oh, I hope we find our brains soon. They're probably cold and hungry by now. Poor things.
SpongeBob	Sandy, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
SpongeBob	Hello?
SpongeBob	Looks like there's evil afoot!
SpongeBob	"I'm sure I've heard that ""no"" before."
SpongeBob	It's that denying desperado's siren song!
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward, do you hear that? You'd better hurry up or you'll be late for work.
SpongeBob	That poor man needs aid!
SpongeBob	That should hold you until your surgeons can amputate our torso.
SpongeBob	Holy Shrimp! This is the best day of my life!
SpongeBob	Well, it's not really stealing if it's your own money.
SpongeBob	Whoa! You were so convincing! You had that guard totally fooled! I think we should skip to the end of the story. Let's just stop here and pick up some props for your evil lair. We'll just need a few dollars.
SpongeBob	Okay, so here's the scene. You two have us here in this cage over a pool of boiling oil. Now that is a crime. Now, you can let us out so we can fight.
SpongeBob	See? I just knew we'd make a terrific bad guy. He is really committing.
SpongeBob	Whoo! You tell 'em, Mr. Krabs!  Bring it around town! Yeah!
SpongeBob	Whoa, okay now. Everybody, settle down, time to eat your patties.  Huh?
SpongeBob	Oh, swoon. That imitation stuff really works. Look out, world!  I'm gonna flatter your socks off.
SpongeBob	Ah, it's just me, Patrick! Fooled ya!
SpongeBob	And you are the fuzziest nut-eating scientist I've ever seen.
SpongeBob	Oh, those impressions are making everyone so happy! I can't stop doing them! I can't..I won't.
SpongeBob	Okay, bye. Yup, everybody still loves it.
SpongeBob	Oh, oh, oh!
SpongeBob	Why sure! Aye! Love to! About what? Who cares?
SpongeBob	Who?, Who?, Who?, Who? Who?, Who?, Who?, Who? Who... am I?  Who am I?  I just can't remember.  Who am I?  I just can't recall.  Who am I to sing this somber song? When you've got six heads, there's something wrong.  Who am I?  Please tell me.  Who am I?  Do you know me?  My name could be Clementine  or it could be Freddie.  I just can't recognize myself. I don't know if I'm ready.  I'm ready!  Who am I?  I have a right to know.  Who am I? Am I friend...  or foe?  I have so many features. It makes it hard to tell. I don't know what my first name is. But my faces ring a bell.  Who am I?  Who am I?  Who am I?  Who am I?  Who am I?  Hello-o-o?
SpongeBob	We're sorry, the person you are callingSpongeBob SquarePantshas been disconnected or is no longer in service.
SpongeBob	Oh no! Now they have mocking mimicry madness!
SpongeBob	Hello.
SpongeBob	Gary the Snail, is that any way to treat an uninvited guest?
SpongeBob	I see you!
SpongeBob	Such a sad story.
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo!
SpongeBob	Gary, calm down. We're all friends here.
SpongeBob	All right, I guess you guys will just have to stay and go to work with me. Just keep a low profile or I could lose my job.
SpongeBob	"""Squatters rights?"" What the heck is squatters rights?"
SpongeBob	Yeah, and I lost my job over it.
SpongeBob	No, no, Patrick, wait, don't close the
SpongeBob	Does that mean no hug?
SpongeBob	Gary, it feels so good to be worm free!
SpongeBob	Why don't you try taking a walk? Works for me.
SpongeBob	Ahh!
SpongeBob	Aw, poor guy was just sleepy. Looks like we're gonna be here a while. See you in the morning, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Patrick, Patrick, calm down! You're at my house! Oh, and that is your rug.
SpongeBob	Patrick, this is bad. Squidward won't make his audition with the Philharmonic Orchestra. What can we do?
SpongeBob	That's it! We could crawl up inside Squidward and play him like a puppet!
SpongeBob	How's that feel, buddy?
SpongeBob	All right, Patrick, we've got a date at the Bikini Bottom Philharmonic. Let's get going.
SpongeBob	Whoa! Excuse me. Sorry.
SpongeBob	Uh, let's ask someone.
SpongeBob	Oh, Patrick! That bus is going to the concert hall!
SpongeBob	The clarinet, where's his clarinet?
SpongeBob	I don't know what's happening! I'm losing control!
SpongeBob	Uh, don't forget to take your shoes off before bouncing.
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	Yeah, and so are the people.
SpongeBob	"Yeah. You said, ""Fancy-up the food"", so I found some shiny stuff for garnish. Got a whole box."
SpongeBob	Patrick, no! The food is for the guests!
SpongeBob	Oh, please, sir. Don't. Stop. You really can stop, sir.
SpongeBob	All right, Mr. Krabs. If you think the Krusty Krab is haunted and needs ghost-busting, I'll stay away for a while.
SpongeBob	What's that, Squidward? 30 Krabby Patties? Coming right up!
SpongeBob	Oh, hello, Mr. Krabs. Place your order with Gary, please. And drop your money anywhere. I'm running out of places to put it. I really don't have time to count it.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, don't go! I need you!
SpongeBob	Oh, what's going on?
SpongeBob	Sounds like it's still haunted.
SpongeBob	"""The Krusty Krab...""  And SpongeBob's Place."" Oh, Mr. Krabs, you're the best!  Whoo!"
SpongeBob	Silly, that's not my bathroom.
SpongeBob	Aw, Plankton. I am so sorry that Karen threw you out.
SpongeBob	Well, if Karen threw you out for doing the same things you always do, maybe you should learn to not do the same things you always do!
SpongeBob	All right, Plankton, the first step to becoming a nicer person is being thoughtful. Try holding a door for someone. It's simple, and it makes people happy. Like this.  After you.
SpongeBob	Plankton, no!
SpongeBob	No, try again.
SpongeBob	Oh, yes, you will! We obviously can't fix your terrible insides, but maybe, just maybe, we can work on your terrible outsides. Makeover time!
SpongeBob	Okay, I feel uncomfortable.
SpongeBob	Beep boop!
SpongeBob	Oh, Plankton-poo! You say the sweetest things.
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	I'm gonna go now.
SpongeBob	Life insurance?
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	I'm not sure, but I think that means for the rest of our lives we are protected. We can't get hurt.
SpongeBob	We're trying to hurt each other.
SpongeBob	Life insurance!
SpongeBob	It's our final test. We're trying to get jellyfish to sting us to prove we can't get hurt.
SpongeBob	I bought some life insurance for Patrick and myself and now we can never be hurt.
SpongeBob	You are magically protected.
SpongeBob	Yeah! You are a cast-iron Squidward.
SpongeBob	Uh, Squidward, I don't think you should lick that. It's got germs.
SpongeBob	Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. He's got life insurance. He can't be hurt.
SpongeBob	Come back, Squidward! Don't do this!
SpongeBob	Ah!
SpongeBob	Nothing soothes one's frazzled nerves like blowing bubbles!
SpongeBob	I'll never pass my driver's test, I'll never get my license, and I'll never know the joys of boat ownership!
SpongeBob	Ooh!  Aww! If only I was as good at driving as I am at blowing bubbles.  Oh! That's it!
SpongeBob	You don't need a license to drive a bubble.
SpongeBob	Then I made a right turn on red like this.
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm not sure I have enough soap to make this many bubble boats.
SpongeBob	I sure do, Plankton!
SpongeBob	Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Hi, Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob	Now, to get your bubble going, just pump your legs like this.
SpongeBob	Absolutely! You just need to pass your final test...out there.
SpongeBob	It's okay! Just calm down!
SpongeBob	Doh!
SpongeBob	Ahh, what a wonderful day. The sun is out, the water is shimmering, scallops are chirping. So peaceful.
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward! Wanna blow some bubbles? Only 25 cents.
SpongeBob	Only a quarter.
SpongeBob	One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go.  Could I interest you in some lessons? Only 25 cents.
SpongeBob	Excuse me, sir, but we are clo-
SpongeBob	We also offer lessons for beginners.
SpongeBob	All right, Squid! That was so good!
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	The hooks?
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Where is everybody?
SpongeBob	But, Mr. Krabs said...
SpongeBob	But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops.
SpongeBob	I guess he didn't.
SpongeBob	Again!
SpongeBob	Ok, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	But, Patrick, we promised.
SpongeBob	Umm...
SpongeBob	Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?
SpongeBob	What am I going to do?
SpongeBob	Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise.  Please save me, Mr. Krabs!  I promise I'll be good!  Whew.
SpongeBob	Aw, you want to say good-bye to Plankton, you old softy you.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I'm gonna be sick.
SpongeBob	So what'd I miss?
SpongeBob	Hey, I was still reading that!
SpongeBob	Huh. I guess I did chop the toppings up after all.
SpongeBob	Whoa, my spatula never did that before.
SpongeBob	What is going on around here?
SpongeBob	I'll help you, baby! Boing!
SpongeBob	Fear not, bestest of friends. You shall have all the ice cream you could ever eat!
SpongeBob	Stop, ice cream! Stop! Stop!
SpongeBob	Not helping!
SpongeBob	Whoa! Stop! That wasn't me.
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	I'm ready! I'm ready!
SpongeBob	Oh, I wonder when my prize will get here.  My prize!  Can it be? It is. The Conch Signal.  From the Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.  As seen on TV. I wonder if it still works.
SpongeBob	Excuse me, I'm...
SpongeBob	I won it in a contest.
SpongeBob	Help... Can't... open mayonnaise.
SpongeBob	Oh...
SpongeBob	Hey!  I've got the doughnuts!
SpongeBob	I can't believe it: I rode in the Invisible Boatmobile, met a villain, and learned to treat third-degree burns, all in one day. So, what are we going to do tomorrow.
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, sir.
SpongeBob	Holy Krabby Patties! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch nemesis: The Dirty Bubble! I can't believe it!
SpongeBob	Oh...
SpongeBob	(excitedly) Yes! (to Gary) Uhhh, what's a blimp?
SpongeBob	Patrick, did you know you left this hose on?
SpongeBob	See Patrick, saving a little water, goes a long way.
SpongeBob	Okay...  And we can wear gloves on our feet  and hats on our captain's quarters, too.
SpongeBob	I learned when I was just a boy, Patrick and I'm willing to pass on what I know. Go sit over there  and let an old pro show you how to do it.  Pay close attention, Patrick. Well, you start  by taking one lace per hand...  And then you... Uh, you gotta... Loop the, the...
SpongeBob	"I've got it! The first rule of shoe-tying is always start with your right foot. Now the lesson will officially begin.  That's... ""knot"" right.  Get it? Knot... right... hmm..."
SpongeBob	I can't believe I've forgotten how to tie my own shoes. They've been tied as long as I can remember.  Well, I'll remember after a good night's sleep.  Oh... No big deal. I'll remember sooner or later.  'Cause I'm ready! I'm... read...  ...y!  I'm read...  ...Ooh!  I'm read...  ... Uh!  I'm read...  ...Ooy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Uh! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Duh!
SpongeBob	He's right! Got to make... Krabby Patties!  Laces or no laces!  Ah... I just have to stand in this one spot.  Ta-da! A perfect patty.
SpongeBob	Okay, Squidward.  Here I come. I'm coming over.  I'm bringing the patty to you. Here comes the patty. No problem. I'm walking...the Krabby Patty...over to Squidward. All right, Squidward. I'm giving you the patty... For the hungry customer... So they can eat it... When I give it to you... Which is right... now.
SpongeBob	I'll just make another... Doh!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry Mr. Krabs, it's just that I... I...
SpongeBob	I forgot how to tie my shoes.
SpongeBob	Could you show me how to tie my shoes?
SpongeBob	I did.
SpongeBob	Ooh...
SpongeBob	Not now, Gary.
SpongeBob	Gary! Well, I'll be! You can tie shoes!  Hoppin' clams! How did you learn to do that?
SpongeBob	Ummmmmmmmm. Hmmmmmmmmmm.
SpongeBob	Check it out! I guess it's plain to see who the true Kenny the Cat fan is!
SpongeBob	Awe, I remember my first visit to The Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Wow pretty good!
SpongeBob	Time to wrap it up!
SpongeBob	Umm...  I guess I'll take a picture of this...  now!
SpongeBob	Hmm... I wonder what Squidward's up to?
SpongeBob	At first, we didn't know what to do with all the money.
SpongeBob	One Krabby Patty coming up!
SpongeBob	Oh no, not again!
SpongeBob	Ah... This is the best day of my life.
SpongeBob	You forgot to teach me how to use... The cash register.
SpongeBob	Do you want four quarters?  Or ten dimes?  Or twenty nickels?  Or one hundred pennies?  Or one quarter, three dimes, seven nickels, and ten pennies?  Or, if you give me a five dollar bill, your options are...
SpongeBob	Well, I'm sure you are.
SpongeBob	Have you finished...?
SpongeBob	Gosh, Squidward sure is a hard worker. He makes me proud to wear these hats.
SpongeBob	"Then you might wanna put these on.  Hmm... Hey, Squidward, you know what? Look!  We forgot to switch the ""Closed"" sign to ""Open"". . It's almost like we could've taken the whole day off!"
SpongeBob	That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.
SpongeBob	Come on, mister, let us out! Don't be so mean! Don't be so fatty!
SpongeBob	And what did you say your name was?
SpongeBob	You're safe with me.
SpongeBob	Morning!
SpongeBob	I know who took your money.
SpongeBob	I'm on it, Mr. K.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, we found your shorts!
SpongeBob	Just one more thing! Pea...  ...nuts. Gary!  Our peanuts jar is totally empty!  Hmmm...  Wait! I know one other place we can find peanuts.  Good thing I still have these peanut plants growing in the windowsill.  A little texture never hurt. There we go.  This sundae's gonna taste great!  Aren't you going to help me, Gary? Gary? Oh, well. More for me!  You know what they say, Gary. I'm easy like Sunday morning.  Okay, let's see my to-do list.  Go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work.. wait, that's not right. I need the one for Sunday.  Ah, here we go. 'Say hi to everyone in Bikini Bottom'.  Hello.  Some people are even  on Sunday.  Hi, mailfish!  Hi, Mrs. Crossing Guard!
SpongeBob	Oh, hi, Patrick. I'm confused.
SpongeBob	Ugly?  You gotta be kiddin' me..
SpongeBob	Oof I'm ugly...
SpongeBob	Help me! I'm so ashamed! I'm spiraling! I'm spiraling!  Thanks Patrick.  It's okay, Patrick. Spiraling, over.
SpongeBob	I'm ugly.
SpongeBob	I'm ugly and I'm proud.
SpongeBob	That felt great! I feel empowered.
SpongeBob	I can't do this, Patrick! I've tried, and I've tried,  but I'm not always as confident as I look. Maybe I'd better just go back and hide.
SpongeBob	They all ran away, Patrick.
SpongeBob	And why is that bag on your head?
SpongeBob	Patrick?
SpongeBob	No, I mean just this morning.
SpongeBob	I mean, we're not ugly, we just stink!
SpongeBob	Sure thing. Didn't mean to bother ya.
SpongeBob	Squidward, are we there yet?
SpongeBob	Umm, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Hi.
SpongeBob	No new spatulas?
SpongeBob	Hello, pole.
SpongeBob	I'm ready!
SpongeBob	A stick in the sand.
SpongeBob	I got it! How about The Kayate Krab?
SpongeBob	You're right, too scary.
SpongeBob	Two... sa- Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a  sa-  Here you go. Two sa-
SpongeBob	Two salads.  That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it.  Where's the grill?
SpongeBob	This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right up to Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much!  Okay SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on...  Mr. Krabs, can I talk to you?
SpongeBob	Sure Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news.
SpongeBob	What's it?
SpongeBob	How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes.
SpongeBob	Stop trying to break me in half?
SpongeBob	Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if...
SpongeBob	There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy.
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward! Wanna go surfing?
SpongeBob	In the water with a huge wave behind us!
SpongeBob	Let's do it!  Your surfboard awaits.
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward, you are a such a card.
SpongeBob	Ow, beg your pardon, aw, excuse me, sorry.
SpongeBob	Come on, Squidward, shake a tail fin.
SpongeBob	Too much, huh?
SpongeBob	You're right, Gary. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
SpongeBob	So listen to my skeem. I'd change it into ice creeeam!
SpongeBob	Almost done.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake.
SpongeBob	No, don't! That's my...  ...award closet.
SpongeBob	But you're Patrick...  Star. You can do anything you want.
SpongeBob	Smaller.
SpongeBob	Yeah!  I do things at work all the time.
SpongeBob	Pick up order!
SpongeBob	Nope.
SpongeBob	Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant.
SpongeBob	Keep trying, Patrick.
SpongeBob	You need a jar.  No.  No.  No. Try...this!  Now take the lid off the jar.  Just relax. Lift your hand.  Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid.  No, the lid.   Freeze!!  Almost there. Now head for the lid.  Cold.  Warmer.  Warmer.  Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!
SpongeBob	That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it.
SpongeBob	Patrick, you do exactly what I do and you'll have an award in no time.  I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready.
SpongeBob	Well, back to the ol' grind.
SpongeBob	Aha!  You're copying me!
SpongeBob	Say, you're good.
SpongeBob	Patrick, how long are you going to keep this up?
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice.  Ha! Not a scratch on me.
SpongeBob	But, Patrick...
SpongeBob	So, what are you going to do, now?
SpongeBob	Gadzooks!!!
SpongeBob	Which leads us to our final rule, always carry a thick tube of emergency Jellyfishing Sting Ointment.
SpongeBob	Bah! Stepped on a pickle.
SpongeBob	Nurse! This hot dog needs help!
SpongeBob	Patrick, with this time machine, we can go back in time, and see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in their prime as young super heroes!
SpongeBob	Well, it's never to early to start your education young man! That's why I brought you this.  Order up, little fella.  I'm so proud of him. Okay, your turn, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Now, do the sea monster!
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Hey everybody! It's Leif Ericcson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgin! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Ericcson Day! There's a note.
SpongeBob	Are you sure?
SpongeBob	I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy!
SpongeBob	He's hungry.
SpongeBob	Sounds great!
SpongeBob	Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do?
SpongeBob	That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get us some cotton candy.
SpongeBob	Hey Pearl! Shake hands with Bubble Buddy!  It's his first time on his own.
SpongeBob	Hey, is this one of those sewing circles?
SpongeBob	Why?
SpongeBob	So, what do you say?
SpongeBob	Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes!  Seems like only this morning that I held his bottle.  They blow up so fast.
SpongeBob	Surf's up!  Oww! I don't have my keys!
SpongeBob	Huh.
SpongeBob	Hey look, an ancient Lamorian toilet plunger,  he-he sorry.  This place is sure a Brain Twister.
SpongeBob	Oh! Ok.
SpongeBob	Mesmerizing.
SpongeBob	Gee, I feel bad for those poor robots, they worked so hard to keep this place clean.
SpongeBob	How's it going guys?
SpongeBob	Oh, uh, yes?
SpongeBob	Is this good?
SpongeBob	And action!
SpongeBob	Cut! With feeling!
SpongeBob	Uh, actually Patrick, that was my grandma's Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	Here, friend. Join the movement.
SpongeBob	Hey, hey Squidward, did you see me?  Okay, see you later, Squidinator.
SpongeBob	Eyelashes!
SpongeBob	Hey guys.  Thanks for the pie, Squidward.  La, la, lalalalalala.
SpongeBob	Part two?  Part two, part two, part two, part two...
SpongeBob	The things that are extra fun, I've written in red.
SpongeBob	Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town.  Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward.  Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward.  Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward.
SpongeBob	That's a good one Squidward.  Next.  Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock.
SpongeBob	Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face.
SpongeBob	Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs.  Okay, see you later.
SpongeBob	Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward, check this out!  Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot.
SpongeBob	Um, okay, I'll try.  Gary! You are gonna finish your dessert and you are gonna like it!  Now it's your turn.
SpongeBob	What pie?
SpongeBob	Alright! So make it 2 million and 2!
SpongeBob	Here we are at the lovely Copacabana beach. Oh, Brazil's beaches are the best!
SpongeBob	Don't do it!
SpongeBob	Patrick made sure to see the panoramic views of the city at Sugarloaf Mountain!
SpongeBob	"No, Patrick, I said, ""Xochimilco"", not...  We learned that in Mexico, instead of Halloween, they celebrate da de los Muertos."
SpongeBob	No, it's a condiment! One of my friends at Plaza Garibaldi told us to check out Mexico's most popular sport, Football! Everyone is so ready at the game! And the whole team won!
SpongeBob	Right.
SpongeBob	He ain't so lucky now. Here we are in Alhambra, at the Palace of the Lions.
SpongeBob	Guggenheim Museum is the craziest building we've ever seen!
SpongeBob	Here I am at the sacred family cathedral in Barcelona.
SpongeBob	Almost indeed.
SpongeBob	Patrick, that is so true.
SpongeBob	Russia is also known for having some of the most talented ballet dancers in the world.
SpongeBob	But no trip to Paris would be complete without visiting the Louvre where you can see thousands of works of art including Venus de Milo. Sadly, her arms are broken off.
SpongeBob	Then we visited the Arc de Triomphe.
SpongeBob	Yeah, we have a movie. You're a starfish. Movie star.
SpongeBob	The Krabby Patty formula is the sole property of the Krusty Krab and is only to be discussed in part or in whole with its creator, Mr. Krabs. Duplication of this formula is punishable by law. Restrictions apply, results may vary.
SpongeBob	Code twelve, code twelve!  Your disguises can't fool me this time, Plankton!
SpongeBob	Only discuss the formula with Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	I got it, I got it!  I got it, I got it!
SpongeBob	Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir!  Hey Mr. Krabs, just taking out that garbage.
SpongeBob	I don't know, Mr. Krabs... I don't know.
SpongeBob	I can see that, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	We don't shake with our hands, remember?
SpongeBob	Sorry,  no can do, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	I'll do the talking around here. I think I'll just ask you two a couple of questions. Questions only the real Mr. Krabs could answer.
SpongeBob	Nuh-uh-uh! I'm running this quiz show, I'll ask the questions. If there's gonna be any 'buts,' they're gonna be from me. Okay, question number two: How much does a Krabby Patty cost?
SpongeBob	So long, Imitation Krabs! Buh-bye!  I knew it was you all along Mr. Krabs, here you go.
SpongeBob	If that was Plankton... Uh-oh!
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	No it's not!
SpongeBob	And finally, we visited the Hamburger Hafen.
SpongeBob	No Patrick.
SpongeBob	Don't I know it!
SpongeBob	Today, Patrick and I went on land to visit England and Big Ben.
SpongeBob	And then, we jumped across the sea to the Molly Malone statue in Ireland. Where they have a special day to celebrate Patrick.
SpongeBob	Look, Patrick. Trafalgar Square. Wasn't it beautiful.
SpongeBob	In Australia, you can find the kangaroo in the outback. Do you know why female kangaroos have pouches?
SpongeBob	Now, that's what I call architecture! She's a beauty, ain't she?
SpongeBob	Not me. I was so scared, I merely soaked my sponge.
SpongeBob	Carbon dioxide?
SpongeBob	Hmm... The endless summer does sound like fun!
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, sir!
SpongeBob	Prove it.
SpongeBob	What a great day.  Hey, Sandy! Look!  I'm Sandy!  Hey Sandy, who am I?  Hello, SpongeBob. Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring.
SpongeBob	Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think?
SpongeBob	I got it!  Incoming!  Oops, I guess I ripped my pants again!
SpongeBob	I guess so...  ...except I ripped my pants!
SpongeBob	How about ripple?  No, thanks, already got one!  Is that a burger you're eating?
SpongeBob	Come closer.  I need... I need...
SpongeBob	Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?!
SpongeBob	When I ripped...  my pants.  I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, all just because I  ripped my pants.
SpongeBob	Sandy!
SpongeBob	This whole sack?
SpongeBob	Wait! You forgot about this pet!
SpongeBob	I know Patrick, days like today only come once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Savor every moment. And it's all thanks to Wormy. I made this for Wormy.  Our new best friend.  Until tomorrow, new best friend. Don't be sad, little buddy, we'll be back first thing in the morning for frolic and fun.
SpongeBob	I don't know, Patrick. But whatever it is...it must've eaten Wormy!
SpongeBob	Patrick, we can't leave this horrible monster in Sandy's house. It might eat Sandy's other pets!
SpongeBob	You look pretty appetizing Patrick. Now just stay here and wait for the monster. I'll go get the net.
SpongeBob	Hit the deck, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Why? Why? He was so young.
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	Run, everybody, run!
SpongeBob	Sandy caught the monster!
SpongeBob	You got a name?
SpongeBob	"Say ""cheese"".  Order up."
SpongeBob	I'm ready. Promotion.  Cleanliness is next to manager-lines.  I'm ready. Promotion. I'm ready. Promotion.
SpongeBob	There's no shower at work.
SpongeBob	Oh, thanks, Patrick. And tonight, after my big promotion, we're gonna party till we're purple.
SpongeBob	I'd better get going. I'm ready. Promotion. I'm ready. Promotion.
SpongeBob	Oh. Sorry, Plankton.  Are you on your way to the grand-opening ceremony?
SpongeBob	Yes.
SpongeBob	Yes! Yeah!  Oh, better luck next time, buddy. Yeah! All right!  People of Bikini Bottom, as the manager of...
SpongeBob	But... But why?
SpongeBob	All right. Get it together, old boy. I know. I'll just stop thinking about it. Hey, you know, I actually feel a little better. I don't even remember why I was sad.
SpongeBob	I know.
SpongeBob	A Triple Gooberberry Sunrise, huh? I guess I could use one of those.
SpongeBob	Waiter, let's get another round over here.  Oh, Mr. Waiter. Two more, please.
SpongeBob	Oh, my head.
SpongeBob	I have worked for Mr. Krabs for many years and always thought he was a great boss.
SpongeBob	Wait! I'm flattered you would do this on my account, but being manager isn't worth killing Mr. Krabs over.
SpongeBob	King Neptune, sir? Would you spare Mr. Krabs' life if I went to get your crown back?
SpongeBob	Patrick, shush!
SpongeBob	Thanks, Mindy.  Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Patrick, Squidward and I...
SpongeBob	Feast your eyes, Patrick.
SpongeBob	You don't need a license to drive a sandwich.
SpongeBob	Now, Patrick. For your information, we are not kids. We are men. And we're off to get King Neptune's crown in Shell City.
SpongeBob	How many seconds was that?
SpongeBob	Gonna get that crown.
SpongeBob	I wish we still had our car.
SpongeBob	Patrick, that's a terrible idea.
SpongeBob	Stupid contacts.  Oh, there it is. I better go wash it off.
SpongeBob	I know!
SpongeBob	The key! Shhh...
SpongeBob	Morning, Patrick! Are you here for your pre-lunch Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob	Hey, Mr. Krabs, I thought we got our tartar sauce delivery on Thursday.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick: raw.
SpongeBob	Your order, sir.
SpongeBob	With relish.  Excuse me!
SpongeBob	Got it!
SpongeBob	Plankton?
SpongeBob	What? Where'd it go?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I'm telling you! He's innocent!
SpongeBob	"But as you are aware sir,  the employee handbook clearly states and I quote,  ""No employee may, in part or in whole, commit the Krabby Patty Secret Formula to any recorded, written, or visual form, including memories, dreams, and/or needle point."""
SpongeBob	But he didn't do it.
SpongeBob	So, you won't talk, eh, Plankton?  I didn't wanna have to do this. Plankton,...  ...here comes the pain!
SpongeBob	Look what's become of Bikini Bottom. We've really gotta get that formula back.
SpongeBob	No, Plankton, teamwork.
SpongeBob	"Say ""team"" like a sports..."
SpongeBob	Gettin' better.
SpongeBob	Patrick, what are you doing?
SpongeBob	Well, I'd love to, but the formula's gone.
SpongeBob	He brings loyalty, Plankton, loyalty. Isn't that right, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Sandy, are you okay?
SpongeBob	Well, I have one friend who's loyal to the very end.  Gary, I'm home.  Gare bear?  Gary? Gary?  Huh?
SpongeBob	What do you mean king of snails? Gary the Snail, you get down here right now and join this team.
SpongeBob	Putting together a team is a lot harder than I thought it would be.
SpongeBob	This feels like it really is the end.
SpongeBob	Good night, Plankton.
SpongeBob	Then why is there cotton candy on your antennae?
SpongeBob	I'm not pretending. I can't believe you thought I was lying.
SpongeBob	But, Plankton, everything's better when you're part of a team.
SpongeBob	Not without a time machine.
SpongeBob	Where would we get one of those?
SpongeBob	Shh!  How are we gonna sneak past those guards?
SpongeBob	Just a little higher, Plankton. Plankton?
SpongeBob	Sorry.
SpongeBob	Plankton has a plan to save Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	Is this where we're gonna build our time machine?
SpongeBob	No.  did it.
SpongeBob	Plankton, are you crying?
SpongeBob	Patrick?
SpongeBob	Where is everybody?
SpongeBob	"The one who watches? Your name is ""The one who watches""?"
SpongeBob	Sure thing but uh, what am I keeping my eye on?
SpongeBob	Mine, too.
SpongeBob	Hey, quarter me!
SpongeBob	the enemy. Now we're a team.
SpongeBob	Got it!
SpongeBob	Well, Plankton and I built a time machine out of an old photo booth and then we added--
SpongeBob	What is it, Patrick?
SpongeBob	My fault?!
SpongeBob	You take that back!
SpongeBob	Yes! We've become alienated from each other. Each one an island unto himself, concerned only with ourselves. And in the name of all fishhood, I am not about to let that happen!  And so, if a sacrifice is needed to restore Bikini Bottom to its former glory...  then I am willing to take one for the team!
SpongeBob	Patrick, you don't have feet.
SpongeBob	Bubbles!
SpongeBob	Come on, guys. Let's go.
SpongeBob	Thank you, Bubbles!
SpongeBob	Uh, Sir? Could you tell us where to find a Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob	Come on, push!
SpongeBob	Sandy! The Krabby Patty! I think I see where it's coming from!
SpongeBob	We're doing it guys!
SpongeBob	Yeah. That's my job!
SpongeBob	Oh, this looks bad! And these guys look hungry!  Look out!
SpongeBob	[he jumps and plucks a feather from a passing pelican and lands][Squidward inks off-screen]
SpongeBob	Don't be sad, Squidward. I left you a little surprise under your shirt!
SpongeBob	A-ha! Caught you red-handed! Gary hates mayo!  Plankton!! Up to your old tricks again already, eh?
SpongeBob	Ah! Mr. Krabs, a customer!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
SpongeBob	No...
SpongeBob	What's the matter?
SpongeBob	Are you ready for the big rush, Patrick?  Pretty soon those hungry customers will be lining up, because we are open!  I'm ready!  I'm ready.  I'm ready...  Patrick, how long have we been standing here?
SpongeBob	Did you find anything?
SpongeBob	Uhhh... I don't know.
SpongeBob	...and burning it!
SpongeBob	Here you are, sir. Stay pretty.  All right. Mr. Krabs is that you? Isn't this great, Mr. Krabs? The Pretty Patties are a big hit!
SpongeBob	Oh, I can't leave, Mr. Krabs. What about the stand?
SpongeBob	Thank you. What should I do now, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	I can't play with you anymore! I just can't take the games!
SpongeBob	You delicate little Krabby Patty. With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness.
SpongeBob	I is 100% ma-male.
SpongeBob	Well, a sponge has to look his spongiest.
SpongeBob	Oh, barnacles!
SpongeBob	There it is! Grandma's house! What wonders await me today? Fresh-baked cookies? Story time? A sweater with love in every stitch? Aw, what am I waiting for?  Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!
SpongeBob	Me, me, me!
SpongeBob	I sure did.  Bye, Grandma, thanks for the ride.  Thank you, Squidward.  Isn't this great? Everybody's in a good mood today.
SpongeBob	No, you're wrong! There's nothing wrong with getting kisses from your grandma.
SpongeBob	Me, too.
SpongeBob	Yeah! Oh, but I'm not sure I know how.
SpongeBob	A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
SpongeBob	Sorry, grandmother, but the kissing has to stop.
SpongeBob	I am glad you see it my way, grandmother.
SpongeBob	Hey, that's my cookie-eating hat! I mean it was when I was a baby.[growls in frustration]
SpongeBob	Well, yeah, there's, eh...  well, let's see, we...  We went over the jazz...
SpongeBob	Storytime?
SpongeBob	No...  Don't I get a present, Grandma?
SpongeBob	Yep, that is it. Here I go.
SpongeBob	So, uh... that's it.
SpongeBob	Thanks, Grandma.  Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	"That's a good one, Patrick! ""On Board!"" WHOA-WHOA-WHOA!!!"
SpongeBob	Will you teach us how to surf, O Great One, so we may get back home?
SpongeBob	Patrick, you made my house sparkling clean.
SpongeBob	But it's fun!
SpongeBob	No problem, Squidward! We're on your side!  Any second now
SpongeBob	Hey! That looked like Squidward!  That looked like Squidward also, in angry mob form!
SpongeBob	Are you Squidward?
SpongeBob	Oh hello there. You don't look like from round there.
SpongeBob	Hibernating? What's that?
SpongeBob	"Why, Sandy? When does your... ""carburation"" begin?"
SpongeBob	Jump!
SpongeBob	Sandy?
SpongeBob	Yeah.  Whew, what a workout.  I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow.  Ow.
SpongeBob	Yeah! I've never played extreme jacks before!
SpongeBob	This squirrel's trying to kill me! Any more of these stunts and I'll be reduced to a puddle!  Wait a minute, I've got to talk my way out of this! Sandy, I think I need to tell you something.
SpongeBob	You do that.
SpongeBob	C'mon, let me back in! You don't understand!
SpongeBob	Sandy?  I never thought I'd say it, but thank Neptune for hibernation!
SpongeBob	Are you renting the barrel, too?
SpongeBob	And this Bikini Bell phone?
SpongeBob	Borrowed? Well, that's a relief. I thought you took it without  permission.
SpongeBob	I don't know. What do you want to do today?
SpongeBob	Yeah, and borrowing is okay as long as we bring it back, right?
SpongeBob	And the candy shop!
SpongeBob	It popped.
SpongeBob	We can't return it!
SpongeBob	You're right,   we've just got to keep our heads. Act normal.
SpongeBob	We've only got ourselves and what we can carry on our backs.
SpongeBob	No more nice, warm beds.
SpongeBob	But it doesn't have to be all bad, right? I mean, at least we have each other.
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	And the best part is: now that we're felons, we don't have to return anything we borrowed!
SpongeBob	Look what I've got!
SpongeBob	You just ate it, Pat. It's all over your face.
SpongeBob	You ate yours,  this is mine.
SpongeBob	This is my candy bar!
SpongeBob	Did I, Patrick, did I? Or did your criminal mind hypnotize me to steal it?!
SpongeBob	We stole a balloon.
SpongeBob	Let's vow never to borrow anything without permission again.
SpongeBob	What diabolical act is she committing now?  Fire! Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming! Stand back, Sandy, fire!  Huh? So I guess there's no fire?
SpongeBob	"Tell me more about this...  ...""Christmas""."
SpongeBob	That's the spirit, Mr. Krabs.  Here you go! You can get started on your letter.
SpongeBob	Not yet.
SpongeBob	Here, Patrick, watch me. Dear Santa, what do I want for Christmas, you may ask? All I want is for you to visit gentle folk here in Bikini Bottom. That is my wish.  Patrick, I designed this mechanism specifically to shoot bottles to the surface. The hopes of everyone rests on the success of its maiden voyage. Fire in the hole!
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Great, Squidward, you finished. What's your wish?
SpongeBob	Ahh, that's the last letter. Huh? Wait! Squidward hasn't written his letter yet!  Squidward! Hurry! Squidward, Squidward! Hurry!
SpongeBob	Howdy, Claus?
SpongeBob	Squidward, c'mon.
SpongeBob	Uh, he should be here any minute. Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming tonight.
SpongeBob	Santa Claus.
SpongeBob	"You're welcome. ""[sadly walks off and cries]"""
SpongeBob	Huh? Hello? Who's there? Huh? Hello?
SpongeBob	Hey, you're S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...  S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...  S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...
SpongeBob	I knew you'd make it, Santa. Hey, Santa, where's your big, round belly.
SpongeBob	Santa! This is the greatest you could've given me. Thank you for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	Squidward! You missed him! He was here just like I said! He gave us all presents. He was jolly and he had a beard. His nose was big and he had rosy cheeks. He was friendly and kind.  And Santa is... oh, his belly was small but his nose was huge with Christmas joy. He was so nice Squidward...
SpongeBob	Never mind, Pat. Sandy said not to come in. Let's am-scray.
SpongeBob	Wow, Pat, that was beautiful!
SpongeBob	I think it came from Sandy's tree.
SpongeBob	She must be dreaming about Texas outlaws.  Look out Sandy, I'm Dirty Dan.
SpongeBob	Come on, Patrick. We shouldn't disturb her anymore.
SpongeBob	Sandy! No! Stop!
SpongeBob	All right, Pat!
SpongeBob	See ya later, Sheriff Sandy!  You're under arrest!
SpongeBob	What makes you think you can be Dirty Dan?
SpongeBob	I'm Dirty Dan!
SpongeBob	I'm Dirty Dan!
SpongeBob	Sandy, stay back. I'm warning ya!  Okay, I warned ya!
SpongeBob	Then we're stuck in here? until the door thaws? in spring.
SpongeBob	Maybe we should build a fire. I got it! We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree!
SpongeBob	Maybe it's her fur!
SpongeBob	All right, all right, hang on a second!  That should be enough, right?
SpongeBob	Pat, are you crazy?!
SpongeBob	I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever!
SpongeBob	It's okay, Sandy. Squirrel pattern baldness is quite common in small mammals!
SpongeBob	Tag, you're it!  Gary will never find me here!  Uh-oh.  Tag! Now I'm it!
SpongeBob	That's just a snail's way of saying he likes you!
SpongeBob	Come on Gary, we gotta let Patrick go to sleep.
SpongeBob	I'm awake!
SpongeBob	Who-ho-ho-ho! Look out! I'm right in front of  you What's wrong with me?  Do I offend?  Hey Gary! Gary, look! It's your favorite ball!  Hey Gary, look! Snail-nip!  Huh? Huh-huh?  Help, Gary, help! Help me! Oh merciful Neptune! I closed the window on my head!  All right, that's it!  Gary, you stop this foolishness, right now.  Gary the snail, answer me when I'm talking to you! OK, that's it mister! You are coming home with me this instant!  Say good-bye to Patrick, Gary.
SpongeBob	OK, fine, if that's how you want to thank me  For all that I've done?  I guess you're not coming back, Gary.  I don't need Gary! I'll just find another pet! Yeah, it'll be better than Gary! I'm going to get a pet that won't go off with my best friend!  Hi guys! Say hello to my new pal Rex!  Not only is he loyal, but he knows tricks too! Watch and learn. Sit, Rex, sit!  Roll over, Rex, roll over!  Now stay, Rex, stay! Good boy, Rex! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?  I'm sure glad we went our separate ways, Gary. A worm really is the pet for me.  So loyal, so trusting, always by my  Who needs worms anyway?  Welcome home, newest bestest friend. Come on out, don't be shy.  You remind me of someone I once knew. A certain someone who's name will not be spoken in this household. Come on, let me show you around, Lary.
SpongeBob	Hello, Gary.
SpongeBob	Du du duuuuu  ttyyyyy!  Gary! Please come back, Gary! Please come home! I'm a wreck without you! I know. If you come back, there'll be a new no-rules rule. You can do whatever you want, when you want.  If you feel like rippin' the sofa, then you rip it up!  And the litter box? Forget about it!  The world is your litter box!  And you don't even have to wait around for me to feed you anymore! 24-hour fridge access!  And you don't even have to use a bowl!  And I know how much you like my prized drift wood carving of Squidward.  Well, think of it as your own personal scratching post! What do you think, Gary? Won't it be fun, Gary?
SpongeBob	G-G-Gary?  Whee!  Oh Gary, I knew you'd never leave me! Aww  Let's go for a walk, pal!
SpongeBob	How many more minutes left in the test?
SpongeBob	Whoo! And how many do I need to pass?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, I'll be all right Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year!  Well, see you next Tuesday!  Yeah!  I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more superduper year.  One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year!
SpongeBob	Oh..
SpongeBob	L e a r  Oh, barnacles.
SpongeBob	No, wait! I changed my mind!
SpongeBob	I can do this! I can do this!  Is it hot in here, Mrs. Puff? Why is it so hot in here?  My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff! Make it stop!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	My license!  It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I-
SpongeBob	To the greatest teacher ever!
SpongeBob	Hi, Boaty.  Boaty, you're cold!  Take my socks.  Oh Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea!
SpongeBob	Give me back my boat!  You'd better stop this boat!  I'm not letting go! Nothing will stop me! Not even  Giant clams?!  I'm not letting go not even for  Cheese graters?!  If you think I'll let go just for a little  educational television?! Oh-no!
SpongeBob	You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student . And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor?
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward, we're jellyfishing.
SpongeBob	You know, Patrick? It always seems like Squidward never has time for fun.
SpongeBob	Hey Patrick, Squid's home! And we're gonna make sure he's greeted by his two best friends!
SpongeBob	I don't think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever.  How about some music on your best day ever? Played on your very own clarinet.  Sorry, my lips are a little dry.
SpongeBob	There's one in position. Ready... set... go!
SpongeBob	Yeah, you're doing great Squidward!
SpongeBob	Yeah, go by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger! Better, better, better! Yeah, yeah, yeah! You've got it now!
SpongeBob	Me too.
SpongeBob	You're not still mad, are you?
SpongeBob	"Wow! The harpoon from ""Jellyfish: The Movie!"""
SpongeBob	No, it's the Jellyspotters!  Bikini Bottom's premier jellyfish enthusiast club! Ah! And their leader! The coolest jellyfish enthusiast ever!  Kevin the Sea Cucumber!
SpongeBob	Hi, Kevin.
SpongeBob	Hi, Kevin. I'm your biggest fan.
SpongeBob	Do you want it to hurt me, Kevin?
SpongeBob	I didn't forget them, Kevin. They're in the trunk.  I can't believe I'm actually out here with the Jellyspotters! I mean all my life I wanted to be a Jellyspotter?  and now I'm out here with you guys with the nets and the jars and the jellyfish and I'm with Kevin and Kevin's with me and we're all with each other and we're all jellyfishing and it's fun and-
SpongeBob	Who wants to lick my cheeks?  I see I have some takers?
SpongeBob	Am I in the Jellyspotters now?
SpongeBob	Now?
SpongeBob	I'm ready!
SpongeBob	Hey, I've heard this call before.
SpongeBob	But... What about my final test?
SpongeBob	King Jellyfish!
SpongeBob	Wow, I didn't know this was a hat!
SpongeBob	ManSponge...
SpongeBob	Come boy Patrick. While our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay.
SpongeBob	It appears to be some sort of prison chamber...  ...made out of frozen tarter sauce. This is incredible. Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil ManRay is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him.  Pat, what are you doing? We're not supposed to touch anything!
SpongeBob	Uh, actually, Mr Man Ray, sir, only your head is free.
SpongeBob	Yeah, sure, why not?
SpongeBob	Really, really, really?
SpongeBob	Oh, me too, me too.
SpongeBob	Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready first day at goodness school?  Pat, get your wallet out.  Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet.  Now, what do you do?
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good.
SpongeBob	Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word.
SpongeBob	It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future.  Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness.  Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff.  We're not supposed to touch it that way, either.  We are really not suppose to touch those, sir. [He aims the weapon at SpongeBob and Patrick] good people have no use for weapons such as...  Thoooose!
SpongeBob	To the Invisible Boat Mobile.
SpongeBob	Not so fast, arch-villain. We still have the orb of confusion.  Take this!  Doy. Duh.
SpongeBob	Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Yoo-hoo? Patrick?!
SpongeBob	And tomatoes -- what's the deal on those things?  I mean, you chop them up into slices, but...  What are they, vegetables or... fruit? And what does that make? Ketchup?
SpongeBob	Quick, SpongeBob, make a witty observation!  Did you ever notice how big squirrels' teeth are?
SpongeBob	Because, they're so darn stupid!
SpongeBob	Mops, mops, mops, what's up with those things? I mean, really.  Oh hey, Sandy!
SpongeBob	We all gotta laugh at ourselves once in a while. I do it all the time!
SpongeBob	We already talked about that, remember?
SpongeBob	Uhh, hi.  Uhh, did you hear about the goldfish who went bankrupt? Now he's a bronze fish.  I guess you heard that one.
SpongeBob	What do I do? Who do I do? SpongeBob, you've got a choice to make:  your friends  or your career.
SpongeBob	Great. I knew sooner or later you'd get it. What a great sport.  Let's give a big hand for Sandy! But clap slow, because remember... She's a squirrel!  Thank you! You've been a wonderful audience, and uhh, good night!  Ah... another spectacular performance, SpongeBob.  Oh, what's this, a fan letter?
SpongeBob	Uhh, Sandy, I think something's wrong with this seat.
SpongeBob	Wa...
SpongeBob	Sandy!
SpongeBob	Crabs? Oh brother. They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention!
SpongeBob	Oooh! Oooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?
SpongeBob	Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?
SpongeBob	I thought that meant you were nuts.
SpongeBob	Hey!  You did that on purpose!
SpongeBob	I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!
SpongeBob	There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature  waiting!
SpongeBob	Tree climber!
SpongeBob	Proves what?
SpongeBob	Can you reproduce by budding.  Can ya? Can ya? Can ya? Can ya?
SpongeBob	I don't know!
SpongeBob	One minute? No problem, Landy!
SpongeBob	No, way, San-day. We can take on your challenge!
SpongeBob	Okay... Well, this is it.
SpongeBob	Looking good, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	We're the masters of land and sea!
SpongeBob	But no one's best at everything. Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy.
SpongeBob	You're right, Patrick. We came to see  pearls 100 feet in the air,  Right? I'll try my oyster call.
SpongeBob	No, the show's about to begin!
SpongeBob	I already said I didn't, Patrick! Sheesh!
SpongeBob	Defensive? I'm not being defensive! Barnacles! What is this, 20 Questions or something?  This is getting a little out of hand. All I did was throw a peanut. I didn't mean to make the oyster cry. I just wanted to see it perform spectacular stunts! Aw, everyone's gonna hate me! I, I need some advice! Now let's see now, who could never hate me no matter what I do?  Squidward? Squidward! Oh, Squidward!
SpongeBob	[]
SpongeBob	Hey Patrick, what are you doing?
SpongeBob	Uh, that's kind of what I wanted to talk about, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Uh, uh, just a second!
SpongeBob	Yes...
SpongeBob	Oh no! Patrick's too sensitive for the big house!
SpongeBob	I'm here to lay my cards on the table, to trim the branches of deception from the tree of life, to shave away the unkempt sideburns from the face of truth! I...
SpongeBob	Mother of pearl! That oyster's a mother! And that pearl's no pearl, it's an egg!
SpongeBob	We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean!
SpongeBob	Ship!
SpongeBob	Squid, wait!
SpongeBob	I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name.
SpongeBob	It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you.
SpongeBob	That was a closer one!
SpongeBob	You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
SpongeBob	So, you don't want it to look good?
SpongeBob	Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
SpongeBob	You're setting us free?
SpongeBob	I always hate going in there!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I...  just used the second one.
SpongeBob	Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before.
SpongeBob	Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!
SpongeBob	Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward.  We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess.
SpongeBob	Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again: bath time.  Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way,  or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way...  So that's how you wanna play it, huh?
SpongeBob	"""I'm sorry you had to see that.""  Hello, Fancy French Restaurant? I've got a naughty snail here who won't take a bath. What? Can you say that again? Slow down, it's like you're speaking some other language!  Hey Gar! How 'bout some leap frog? Weehee! Okay, your turn.  Hey Gar! How 'bout some leap frog?  ... I've got a crisp dollar bill for the next fella to take a bath in this house!  Ya-da-da-da... [stops dancing] That didn't work either, huh?  Gary! Gary! Look what I found! It's an old, pirate treasure map revealing a location of buried pirate treasure in this very house. Come on, boy, let's go get that treasure. Whoo! Okay, Gary, now 40 paces to the left. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 24, 25, 26, twenty seveeen... 40. The treasure must be in here!  Wow, Gary, look! A pirate treasure chest."
SpongeBob	Aww, stuck in a tree? It's time to clean up your act, Gary. . Oh, no! I bathed Gary too hard and removed his skin.  Gary! Bring that ladder back this instant. I am really not amused, mister. You are going to take a bath, and you are going to get clean right now.
SpongeBob	Don't use that tone of voice with me. You will do what I say when I say. [Gary slithers forward] What are you doing? I am talking to you, mister. [Gary stops right next to some mud] Do not go near that mud puddle! Gary, the snail, do you hear me? I am giving you three seconds to get away from that mud puddle. One, [Gary moves closer to the mud] two, [Gary moves closer to the mud] two and a half...[Gary leans over the mud] don't make me say three!  Gary! Gary! Gary! GARY!  I'm a dirty boy.
SpongeBob	Plankton!  But Mr. Krabs, he's your arch-enemy.  He's been trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula for years.
SpongeBob	Barnacles, Mr. Krabs. How much money did you lose?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs! I don't want to work for him!  I want to work for you here at the Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob	What is this place?
SpongeBob	A grill is a grill, this is surely so,
SpongeBob	I'm sorry Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!
SpongeBob	Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way.
SpongeBob	Keep going.
SpongeBob	Well...there is one thing I've always wanted...  Wow!
SpongeBob	Faster! Faster!
SpongeBob	No, I don't really feel like it!
SpongeBob	[mocking Plankton] Do ba da ma!
SpongeBob	OK. Ready, Patrick? One...
SpongeBob	It looks like a giant pencil.
SpongeBob	It's a jellyfish.
SpongeBob	Do you know what this means, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Be careful, Patrick! Being an artist is a heavy responsibility. Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such.
SpongeBob	We can't let it go into town!
SpongeBob	Wait! I've got another idea! This'll be the ultimate prank. I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door... it won't be me! Aww, look at him. Ain't he a doll!? All he needs is a tie.  Ready for action!
SpongeBob	DoodleBob, stop!
SpongeBob	Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there...
SpongeBob	See what I mean, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Eh hem.
SpongeBob	Arrgh!
SpongeBob	Hold still, Doodle. This is for your own good.  Take that and this and this and that and this that this that...  I am SpongeBob, destroyer of evil!
SpongeBob	Goodnight, magic pencil.  Oh hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water?   DoodleBob!  No hard feelings, right?   What do you think you're doing, doodle?!
SpongeBob	Take a look for yourself, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Oh, great magic pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box!
SpongeBob	Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly.
SpongeBob	Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naive.
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty a secrets stuff, too! Uhh  I've got my secret socks on.  And my secret Gary's bowl!  My secret TV!  And my secret TV channel.  What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?
SpongeBob	But... we're supposed to be...  friends forever.  I feel so filthy!  I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself!  I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!
SpongeBob	Oh, what do you know, you're a snail!
SpongeBob	Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper.
SpongeBob	No, really, Patrick! Look!
SpongeBob	OK! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes!  Huh?
SpongeBob	I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along!  Wait 'till I tell Gary!
SpongeBob	Les hold on a second!  And voila!  It's under your nose!
SpongeBob	Uh.. Plankton, sir?
SpongeBob	Um... no.
SpongeBob	Wow! A golden spatula! And its even got my name on it.
SpongeBob	You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me!  Even if we are friends!  Never, never, never, never!
SpongeBob	Time for a well-balanced breakfast.  This isn't what I had in mind.  Let me just grab my pants.  I guess I'm not wearing any pants today.  I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later Gary! ...I guess.  You're right, Gary! There  something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help!  Squidward! Help!
SpongeBob	Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone!  Never! Never!
SpongeBob	I must fight!
SpongeBob	I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns.
SpongeBob	No, people. Let's be smart and bring it off.
SpongeBob	Right. So, if we can all just pretend that Squidward was a fireman, or some guy in an ambulance, then I'm sure that we can all pull together and discover what it truly means to be in a marching band.
SpongeBob	That's the spirit, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Wow! Now we never have to stop working!
SpongeBob	Psst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen  at night!
SpongeBob	I don't know, Squidward,  it's kinda dark out there.
SpongeBob	What? What do I know?
SpongeBob	The Slash-Bringing Hasher?
SpongeBob	He forgot the secret sauce?
SpongeBob	You mean like this?  Or like this?  Or this?  Or this?  But what about this? Or this, or this, or this, or...
SpongeBob	Tuesday.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	What, what, what does he do?!
SpongeBob	Ohhhhh.
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?
SpongeBob	I didn't know the buses ran this late.
SpongeBob	No, that's not it.  I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me! You must really like me!
SpongeBob	It's just a penny, sir.  It doesn't matter.
SpongeBob	Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. She's single.
SpongeBob	Oh, come on, Mr. Krabs! You look great!  You wait here while I go break the ice!
SpongeBob	I work here, Mrs. Puff. Want to meet my boss?
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff, I'd like to introduce you to my boss, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Wait, he's trying to tell you something!
SpongeBob	No, wait... he wants to take you...
SpongeBob	Breath spray?
SpongeBob	Relax, Mr. Krabs. Just a little joke. Good luck with you know who.
SpongeBob	What are you going to do?
SpongeBob	Nope.
SpongeBob	I got the flowers. For Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob	I bought the biggest box they had!
SpongeBob	As your financial advisor, I suggest that...
SpongeBob	I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! But you keep telling me to buy things for Mrs. Puff! It's all really confusing.
SpongeBob	See?! You just did it again!
SpongeBob	Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight?
SpongeBob	It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day. Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license!  Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only-six o'clock!  Okay, here we go, here we go.  Bah! I know! I just need to get a little blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics?  I can feel those juices pumpin' now!  Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper!  Come on pencil, make words.
SpongeBob	"I know I have an essay to write! Now come on, Gary.  I've got to make sure you have your nutrition Gary, so I'm not leaving until you eat every single bite.  Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some creme brule? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits?  Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen.  Hmmm...I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage.  Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long...and it's only...10 o'clock! Ooh... No more fooling around! I've gotta get back to work! Ok, Mr. Essay, I say... prepare to be written!  I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah...yeah...yeah! And some of these, and some of these...Almost there and...done. Now lets see how it looks so far. ""The-""  Break time! Pacing always helps me think! Let's see, only 799 words to go...thinks SpongeBob think!"
SpongeBob	That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you!
SpongeBob	What do you mean 'overly dramatic?' Gary? All that choking sure made me hungry.
SpongeBob	Rye or pumpernickel?
SpongeBob	Hi-yah!
SpongeBob	Stop Pants, you get back here this instant! Paaants...!
SpongeBob	Here you go, Mrs. Puff! 800 words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I came over to see if you wanted to go jellyfishing. But I can see you're busy having an episode.
SpongeBob	Darn, I like the funnel. Well, what is it, then?
SpongeBob	"Your parents?  ""Dear Patrick, your mom and I are coming out tomorrow for Starfish Day. Please try to remember, but don't try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself like last time. Love, Daddy."""
SpongeBob	That's what I'm saying, Pat! If your parents got to meet a real dummy, they'd realize what a genius you really are!
SpongeBob	I'm supposed to look stupid, Gary!
SpongeBob	Hi.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick! Patrick!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I get the feeling that you think I really  dumb!
SpongeBob	I have a confession to make. I lied about being stupid. I just acted like a fool so you would appreciate Patrick a little bit more. I know how to talk, and eat, and do laundry. I even separate the darks from the lights. So what do you say we start over and try again? Hi! My name is SpongeBob SquarePants. And I am not a dummy.
SpongeBob	No! It's normal size and fully functional, watch.  2 plus 2 equals 4.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that!
SpongeBob	Well, sometimes, but not... Recently.
SpongeBob	Sentence enhancers?
SpongeBob	Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, how the  are ya?
SpongeBob	You mean ?
SpongeBob	Yea, verily! Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators.
SpongeBob	Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators!   Eels again.
SpongeBob	Ah, !
SpongeBob	Aha! Now I'm gonna tell Mr. Krabs on you!
SpongeBob	Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Well, he said...
SpongeBob	We'll probably get 40 lashes!
SpongeBob	Five, six, seven...
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?
SpongeBob	I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles.
SpongeBob	Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
SpongeBob	Well, first I draw this head.  Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen.
SpongeBob	But I did deserve that.  I deserved that, too.  And I deserve this!
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Wow.  Really?
SpongeBob	I did it, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it.  Ta-da!
SpongeBob	I've gotta sniff the marble!
SpongeBob	With this tool, I shall give birth to art.
SpongeBob	Gotcha!  Barnacles! How'd he do that? Someday I'll catch old No Name.
SpongeBob	Why, this is a hole, sir. You see, I am a sponge, and...
SpongeBob	No-one Mr. Krabs. I was just sharing my jellyfish jelly with the customers.  Here you go Mr. Krabs. Send your taste buds on a journey.
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, sir!
SpongeBob	Okay, Mr. Krabs. Just make sure the jellyfish are comfortable. They are oh, so sensitive.
SpongeBob	Well, there's no more! Now, that's jellyfishing!
SpongeBob	Wrong number.  I guess Gary forgot to pay the electric bill!  Gary, is that you? Gary?  Uh, yeah, good idea, Gary, there's probably some candles in the kitchen.  Hello, what's this? What are you doing here, oh delicious one? A little snack will calm my nerves! Mmm... a Krabby Patty with blue jelly.  Blue jelly!  Hey, old No Name? What's happening?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs? No! Now I know why you brought me here. But what can we do?  Mr. Krabs! Stop this madness! Stop it right now!
SpongeBob	The squeaky bolt on this door was driving me crazy!
SpongeBob	Goodbye, friends!
SpongeBob	I can't believe I'm representing the Krusty Krab in the Fry Cook Games.
SpongeBob	Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob	Ah, sorry, Patrick.
SpongeBob	They don't let just anybody be a fry cook. We're an elite corp!
SpongeBob	You take that back!
SpongeBob	Cone head!
SpongeBob	Patrick, what are you doing here? You're not a fry cook.
SpongeBob	Pink!
SpongeBob	He is?
SpongeBob	For the Krusty Krab!!!
SpongeBob	Top that, Pinky.
SpongeBob	I never liked you!
SpongeBob	Let's promise never to fight again, buddy.
SpongeBob	I can't accept your money, Mr. Krabs. Grilling is my passion!
SpongeBob	Why?
SpongeBob	Right!
SpongeBob	Goin' on a strike! Goin' on a strike! I still don't know what a strike means. But we're goin' on a strike!
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	No! Squidward! You didn't tell me I was going to get fired! Without the Krusty Krab, I-I-I...  Oh, Squidward, could you hold me? I think I'm going to be sick.
SpongeBob	I can't do it, Squidward. This hat is my friend! It never oppressed me.
SpongeBob	How's this, Squidward?
SpongeBob	I don't know. Squidward told me to yell it at people.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Squidward.  How about I try the signs again?
SpongeBob	That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands.
SpongeBob	And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve! Even if it takes forever!
SpongeBob	I did exactly as you said, Squidward. I dismantled the establishment! Now we'll get our jobs back for sure.
SpongeBob	Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood.
SpongeBob	Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat!  Uhh...  The gang's all here...  Ohhh!
SpongeBob	Hang on! I'll save you!
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squiddy, old-pal. That's what friends are for.  So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh? Some friend. A real friend would perform for you!
SpongeBob	And Patrick is a dirty, stinky, rotten friend stealer!  Umm, I can fix this.
SpongeBob	You're just a backbiting, backstabbing silly blob of...
SpongeBob	Squidward.  A dinner party? I'd love to!  Did you miss me?
SpongeBob	Thanks, best friend!
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?
SpongeBob	It was an Alaskan... Bull... Worm!
SpongeBob	Sandy! Sandy!
SpongeBob	Sandy, I saw it! It's big... scary... and pink!
SpongeBob	Um, I do?
SpongeBob	How would you know?! It's always behind you! Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go!
SpongeBob	Sandy, if you want to get to that worm, you're gonna have to go through me!  Sandy, no! I can't let you! I'm not gonna let you get killed. If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure!
SpongeBob	You did.
SpongeBob	There isn't anything...
SpongeBob	I...
SpongeBob	Sandy, that's not...!
SpongeBob	That's not the worm.
SpongeBob	I could've thought of that. Hey, wait a minute! I was right, wasn't I?!
SpongeBob	Say it!
SpongeBob	Say it!
SpongeBob	What do we do now?
SpongeBob	Yay! Let's go tell everybody!
SpongeBob	Yes sir!
SpongeBob	But you can take these Patties, sir. I made them in the off chance that you'd decide to instigate some bun inspection today, Mr. Plankton, sir!
SpongeBob	Oh, please, sir! I want to make you so happy and proud!
SpongeBob	Wh-what?
SpongeBob	Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...
SpongeBob	It's okay, Squidward. I'm official, look!
SpongeBob	I tried, Mr. Plankton. I really did.
SpongeBob	Man your stations! Red alert! Red alert! Take cover!
SpongeBob	It's your arch competitor, Krabs. His goal in life is to steal a Krabby Patty and ruin our restaurant.
SpongeBob	Knick-knack, the Patty's back! You did it, Mr. Plankton. Victory screech!
SpongeBob	What a beautiful day.
SpongeBob	Nothing.
SpongeBob	What a guy. Is it any wonder he's so popular? Just imagine if I were a lifeguard.  That would be so cool.
SpongeBob	White stuff. You think I'm a lifeguard?
SpongeBob	Hi.
SpongeBob	I'm not just ready.  I'm ready, Freddie.
SpongeBob	A sea monster!
SpongeBob	Oh, no, that's not possible. The lagoon is closed.
SpongeBob	They would have to have crossed the line.
SpongeBob	Don't move!  Catch this!
SpongeBob	Goodbye, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Wey, wook. It's Widward!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!
SpongeBob	Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine!  As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club!
SpongeBob	Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything.
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization.
SpongeBob	Have you said hello to the flowers yet?
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward! Still riding a machine to work, I see!
SpongeBob	Huh? Please, Mr. Krabs, let her stay! She won't hurt nobody nohow!
SpongeBob	Good one, sir.  Ha, it worked, girl!  We'll just keep you here until Patrick finishes that stable I asked him to build.  Only eight more hours.
SpongeBob	That was close.  From now on, no more hijinks. Order up!
SpongeBob	Oh.
SpongeBob	You got it, Squidward?  Ghosts.  Mystery, you ate my hat!  Mystery, you ate my spatula! You ate all the Krabby Patties! You ate the stove! You ate Old Man Jenkins!
SpongeBob	[sniffles] You do?
SpongeBob	Ok, girl, you're free to go.  I can't keep you anymore.  I know it's hard for you to understand, but Mr. Krabs is right. You belong in the wild.  Well, what are you waiting for? Can't you see I don't want you anymore?  Just get out of here, you stupid, dumb animal!  Well, she's gone and I'll never see her again.
SpongeBob	You're good at that.  Hey everyone! Squid says he doesn't like Krabby Patties. Ha!
SpongeBob	What? What did you say?
SpongeBob	Never had a Krabby Patty?! Well, you've got to have one right now!  No wonder you're always so miserable! Here, try this.
SpongeBob	Open up the tunnel, here comes the train. Choo-choo...
SpongeBob	But it's good for you!
SpongeBob	A quarter?
SpongeBob	Come on, Squidward.
SpongeBob	It's delicious...
SpongeBob	But, it doesn't make any sense. The Krabby Patty is an absolute good.  is immune to its tasty charms.
SpongeBob	I didn't think it was possible, but, I guess some people just don't like Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	...And while I strongly disagree with your decision, I accept it.  You know, it's not often I get to make one like this. I want to see the look on their face when they take that first bite.  Triple Krabby Supreme! Triple Krabby Supreme! Did somebody order a Triple Krabby Supreme? Huh, they must've left.
SpongeBob	Squidward?  Is that you?
SpongeBob	And why are you holding a patty behind your back?
SpongeBob	I knew it all along, Squidward. No one can resist a Krabby Patty!  Squidward! How many are you eating? Squidward!  Squidward, you can't eat all those patties at one time! Squidward!
SpongeBob	Excuse me, miss?
SpongeBob	Hi, I'm SpongeBob!
SpongeBob	Can I be excused for the rest of my life?
SpongeBob	Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be...  Flats! Uh, hello, sir. Kick any good butts lately? Yeah, I remember last week, I was kicking this guy's butt real good. And he leans over and says, 'Hey, you know, life's like a bucket of wood shavings.  Except for when the shavings are in a pail, then it's like a pail of wood shavings!
SpongeBob	Patrick? Is that you?
SpongeBob	Patrick, you there?
SpongeBob	I just can't, Mrs. Puff. My physical being is at stake, let's just leave it at that.
SpongeBob	Aw, thanks Mrs. Puff. I knew I could count on you.
SpongeBob	I've got diarrhea!  Huh? Are you Flats' dad?
SpongeBob	"Okay, okay, I got to skip town, start a new life, live under an assumed name! ""BobPants SpongeSquare"". Yeah, that's good. Grow a beard, and then shave it off, and live happily ever after."
SpongeBob	He's still gonna kick my butt!
SpongeBob	Go away, Gary. I don't want you to see this. It'll be ugly.
SpongeBob	What can I get for you...handsome?
SpongeBob	The Powdered Driftwood is exquisite.
SpongeBob	He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!
SpongeBob	We've been smeckledorfed!
SpongeBob	Oops, I dropped it in the toilet!
SpongeBob	Phew, that's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it.
SpongeBob	But you told me to give it to him!
SpongeBob	Yes, sir.
SpongeBob	What do you mean, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	What a brave man, going in the line of duty like that! Why? Why? Why?!
SpongeBob	Oh, Neptune, get away!  Ahem. Ok, all set back here. Nothing unusual about a muddy shovel in the trunk.
SpongeBob	Well, the back door was locked, so I came around here.  So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go put my hat in the freezer now.
SpongeBob	It was all Mr. Krabs' idea.
SpongeBob	Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!
SpongeBob	Thank you!
SpongeBob	Pretty smart, huh?
SpongeBob	Sure, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Hats!
SpongeBob	Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, you're going too high!
SpongeBob	I said, I think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, I can't do that!
SpongeBob	First we establish a base camp at 15,000 feet...
SpongeBob	Where's what, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Welcome aboard, Squidward! You've just set sail on the S.S...  ...Imagination... where our only destination is fantastic adventure! Where do you want to go first?
SpongeBob	Arr.
SpongeBob	I still can't believe those pirates beat all those robots.
SpongeBob	Hey, our box is gone!
SpongeBob	Autograph!
SpongeBob	You forgot your belt! You forgot--  Mermaid Man's secret utility belt! The emblem of submersible justice! For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations...and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands! Well, I guess I should return it.  Or not!  I could just hang onto it till after work...all alone with Mermaid Man's belt. I wonder what this button does!  Whoa!  The small ray!
SpongeBob	Nothing.
SpongeBob	Yes.
SpongeBob	Please don't tell!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry Squidward, but you made me do it!
SpongeBob	Uhh, I can do it!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Pat, you don't understand! This is serious! I don't know how to unshrink him! He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life.
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Oh no!
SpongeBob	It's only two people no big deal, nobody else saw it.
SpongeBob	Whoo! I'm gonna have to get a bigger jar.
SpongeBob	Mom?
SpongeBob	This is it, Gary!
SpongeBob	Hey, I'm getting mine next!
SpongeBob	First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed.
SpongeBob	Starboard.  Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924.
SpongeBob	1924?
SpongeBob	Floor it?
SpongeBob	Okay, thirty-eight.
SpongeBob	Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood.
SpongeBob	I don't know, Patrick.
SpongeBob	...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers...  ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight.
SpongeBob	Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over.
SpongeBob	Uhh...
SpongeBob	I... I think so.
SpongeBob	Floor it?
SpongeBob	I think I am cheating!
SpongeBob	Cheating... I'm a cheater! Cheater...
SpongeBob	I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater!
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated.
SpongeBob	Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile!  Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!
SpongeBob	This must be the night driving part of the test.
SpongeBob	That depends, did I pass?
SpongeBob	Oh, you're right! Mrs. Puff's in jail and it's all because of me! I'm such a barnacle head!  Poor Mrs. Puff. I know, I gotta get her out! But to get her out of jail, first we gotta get in jail.
SpongeBob	Uhh, savings.
SpongeBob	Well, that went better than expected.
SpongeBob	SpongeBob. It's me, SpongeBob.  We're gonna bust you out of here. C'mon, Mrs. Puff!
SpongeBob	No, it's really me!  I brought Patrick along too.
SpongeBob	That's a good one, Mrs. Puff. Now hop in. Come on!
SpongeBob	Excuse us for just one second, Mrs. Puff.  Patrick, she has lost it! She's completely institutionalized. She's forgotten what it's like to live in the outside world. To not be in prison.
SpongeBob	Psst!  Hop in, Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob	No! What are you doing? Help! Help! [As the officers carry him to the jail vehicle, he kicks his legs.] No, no, please! I have a snail to feed! I can't go to jail now! This is not a good time! No, please, please! I'm not a criminal!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I threw it. We're having a snowball fight. Don't you get it?
SpongeBob	Patrick! How could you?
SpongeBob	I can start you off as a buck private, but with hard work, perhaps you can rise through the ranks and become a regular private!
SpongeBob	Aha! Aiding the enemy! I've caught you red-handed, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, it's out.
SpongeBob	Can I be Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	If you're in this war, then where's your fort?
SpongeBob	See, it is too small.
SpongeBob	Yes, Patrick?
SpongeBob	They taste even better.  Hi, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	All I have is 5.
SpongeBob	Ah! My bubble production has increased two-fold, thanks to you, Hatty.
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs, you said it yourself... I was born to wear this hat. I don't want to give it back. I can't get rid of this hat now. Not after all that we've been through.  Thanks Mr. Krabs, I'll call you Hatty. And that's when you showed up.
SpongeBob	Nope.
SpongeBob	What is it?
SpongeBob	No deal, Mr. Krabs. I'm sticking with Hatty. Thanks for the offer, though.
SpongeBob	Cursed?
SpongeBob	He must've been number one.
SpongeBob	Right now?
SpongeBob	Sure there is. He's buried out in Floater's Cemetery.
SpongeBob	You'll never guess what I found in my sock last night! Go ahead, guess!
SpongeBob	I'm down here, sir.
SpongeBob	It's almost on, Gary.
SpongeBob	There I am, Gary! There I am!
SpongeBob	Time to go do my favorite thing at my favorite place.
SpongeBob	You're right! Wow, he recognized me.
SpongeBob	Wow. I'm getting recognized all over. Why, next thing you'll know, people are going to start doing things like holding doors open for...  Why, sir, I'm flattered.
SpongeBob	F-I-N. There we are, darling. Hmph. Looks like shyness got the best of him.
SpongeBob	Please, good people, no photos at work.
SpongeBob	I'm so misunderstood. Alas, good people, even the brightest of stars grow weary, and I am no exception. But I will shine again after a quick break in my quarters. Stay beautiful.
SpongeBob	Nah, I can't take that gig, Krabber. That phase in my career is over. I'm an entertainer now.
SpongeBob	Pipe down, Squidward. This crowd looks angry. They're not going to wait any longer. I think I better give them what they need, and fast.
SpongeBob	That's no problem, ladies and germs. 'Cause SpongeBob is here to satisfy.
SpongeBob	They want juggling and jokes at the same time? Tough crowd.
SpongeBob	Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa!
SpongeBob	You like that?
SpongeBob	Ready for the grand finale?
SpongeBob	The Krusty Krab Employee Manual; 2nd Revised Edition; Page 35; Section 19; Clause 3a, states: All staff must remain on the premises until the days receipts are fully accounted for.
SpongeBob	Squidward, you're making a big mistake!
SpongeBob	Well, I guess I can't stop you, but Squidward, it's a cold, cold world out there. No one's going to serve you happiness on a silver platter.
SpongeBob	Or a football playing king in space...with a mustache.
SpongeBob	There ya go. So, where you living these days?
SpongeBob	A football playing king in spa--
SpongeBob	Nonsense. You stay as long as you need to.  Goodnight, my little angel.  Breakfast is ready! You're gonna need to build up your strength again so I laid out a big buffet for you.
SpongeBob	Oh, wow. Nurturing a broken spirit sure is a lot of work. I'm bushed. Still, it feels nice to do good.  Goodnight, Gary.
SpongeBob	Goodnight.
SpongeBob	I'm sure he's close to a breakthrough.
SpongeBob	Here you go, Your Majesty.
SpongeBob	Fine, I'll just take it out.
SpongeBob	OK. Don't move.  Here you go. It's alphabet soup. I made it special.
SpongeBob	...they can get back to their lives!
SpongeBob	Then have some more dimes!  I've got plenty of 'em!
SpongeBob	So, if Squidward never stole the dime, he can come back to work, right?
SpongeBob	Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready!  Ready to get it on.  Hi...
SpongeBob	Hi-yah! Sandy?
SpongeBob	Yeah, let's go in.
SpongeBob	It's on!  If I could just run this under some hot water...
SpongeBob	Super Weenie Hut Jr's?
SpongeBob	That's impossible!
SpongeBob	Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will!
SpongeBob	Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap.
SpongeBob	My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's.
SpongeBob	I've got no choice.
SpongeBob	Well, that makes me pretty mad.
SpongeBob	I, uhh...  don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy!
SpongeBob	Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember?
SpongeBob	I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos.
SpongeBob	What's that?
SpongeBob	I can't do it. I can't do it, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Empty my mind...
SpongeBob	Taken care of.  Right this way, please.  Good evening, sir.  From our menu tonight, might I recommend the Krabby Newburg?  We take the finest cuts of aged, imported kelp, stuff them with herbs from our garden, wrap them in parchment with our award-winning shallot tapenade, slow-roast them for six hours in our wood-fired, clay-filled oven, or kiva, and serve them with a garnish of wilted coral on a mahogany plank.
SpongeBob	Fine dining and breathing are all I know how to do.
SpongeBob	Uhh... err... the fork on the left?
SpongeBob	Please enjoy the food!  Would you like some cheese on that, sir?
SpongeBob	What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out.  What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary?  Psst, Gary? Gere-Bear?
SpongeBob	I surrender! Oh.
SpongeBob	There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you?
SpongeBob	"That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels ""recharged.""  If I didn't know better, I'd say he was...  ...a robot. Nah."
SpongeBob	Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Not even a chuckle. See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's...  ...a robot.
SpongeBob	Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either.
SpongeBob	I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you!
SpongeBob	Mr...
SpongeBob	Squidward, the robots are running the Navy!
SpongeBob	Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot.
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch!
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear?
SpongeBob	I got an idea.  Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robot tricks.  If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will.
SpongeBob	This is the last robot, Squidward.
SpongeBob	The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their... imagination.  Hey, it's time to feed Gary.
SpongeBob	I didn't say anything, either.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick! It's totally helpless.  It looks like he can't even fly yet.
SpongeBob	Is it true? Are you hungry?
SpongeBob	Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before.
SpongeBob	Of course, scallops love worms!
SpongeBob	Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah, look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, look at the funny face!  Look at the funny face!
SpongeBob	You know Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves.
SpongeBob	Yes, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Yes, Patrick?
SpongeBob	You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself?
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Oh, Patrick, I'm so glad you're home after working all day. I can't wait for my break!
SpongeBob	Uhhh?
SpongeBob	You haven't been helping at all with Junior!  We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything.
SpongeBob	Hmmm?
SpongeBob	Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock.
SpongeBob	Six o'clock.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Work?!
SpongeBob	Overtime?!
SpongeBob	Show me where I can sign up for this, because I've been working my fingers to the
SpongeBob	Did you catch him?
SpongeBob	Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore.
SpongeBob	Heave-ho!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on. Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?
SpongeBob	First we need to set up the tarp.
SpongeBob	Patrick, the lid's already off.
SpongeBob	Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall.
SpongeBob	Noooooo!  Patrick?
SpongeBob	That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs said
SpongeBob	Did it work?
SpongeBob	Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet.
SpongeBob	Hurry Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea!
SpongeBob	Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de- butt me!
SpongeBob	Oh, you know, just hanging around.
SpongeBob	You mean our butts?
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Sorry, Granny, why don't you walk yourself across the street.
SpongeBob	'Fraid not, Schnozward! I wouldn't hang out with you for all the money in Krabs' mattress!
SpongeBob	Don't you remember? We told that pink freak to BEAT IT! In fact, we've already insulted all of your rotten friends, and no one will hang out with you, 'cause you have no friends left, Mr. LoserBob LonelyPants!
SpongeBob	Hey, Chipmunk!
SpongeBob	WHO HE IS JUST STINKS!
SpongeBob	It's too late.  Patrick? Sandy?
SpongeBob	What's the gorilla doing underwater in the first place?
SpongeBob	Hey! I was just going to say that!
SpongeBob	What's it doing?
SpongeBob	It's ok sir. I'm sure I...
SpongeBob	Uh-huh.
SpongeBob	Wow...!
SpongeBob	I respect your meticulous nature.
SpongeBob	Yep.
SpongeBob	Oh, what a relief. I thought you were a horrible mutant worm who was about to soak me with digestive juices and slowly consume me over a period of weeks.
SpongeBob	Thanks, Patrick. You're a life-saver. Now that I haven't suffocated, it's high time I got back to this list of house-sitting duties. So without further ado, Patrick, I'd like you to please immediately exit the treedome.
SpongeBob	I'm trying, Squidward, but clocking out is the most upsetting part of the day!  At least soon, I'll be home where I can relive allthe wonderfulmoments from my day at work.  I'm all over it, boss man! Order up, Gare-ward!
SpongeBob	Psst! You missed a spot!
SpongeBob	Ahem. We'll show Squidward. We're not afraid of any old movie.
SpongeBob	Patrick, it's okay.
SpongeBob	Well, we'll watch it again. And this time, all the way through. Okay. Keep your eyes open.
SpongeBob	Must close eyes! Too scary!
SpongeBob	Yeah. We looked fear right in the face and... avoided direct eye contact.
SpongeBob	Aw, thanks, old pal. But then, who's gonna walk you home?
SpongeBob	I think so! Goodnight!
SpongeBob	Here.  Die in mine.
SpongeBob	:What's going on?
SpongeBob	Welcome, Trainee! The foundation of the Krabby Patty is as follows: bun, lettuce, tomato, onion, sauce, and secret recipe patty.
SpongeBob	Not yet it isn't for you see, this patty is incomplete! Come on new guy. We gotta get that pickle for the customer! Get on! In the history of The Krusty Krab we have never served an incomplete patty and we're not gonna. Not on my watch!
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	Plankton!
SpongeBob	I don't like it! I don't like it!
SpongeBob	Yes sir!
SpongeBob	I'm ready. Depression. I'm ready. Depression.
SpongeBob	By the all seeing eye, ye are worthy. We are not.
SpongeBob	Good neighbors are we! La-la-la-la-la-la!
SpongeBob	Hooray!
SpongeBob	Whee!
SpongeBob	The Mitten!
SpongeBob	We're brave!
SpongeBob	Our spines!  Yeah!
SpongeBob	Okay!
SpongeBob	Water!
SpongeBob	All right!

SpongeBob	Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!

Squidward	HELP!
Squidward	Hooray, Mr.
Squidward	What would you like to order, Patrick?
Squidward	Hello? Sorry, sir, we're close...
Squidward	Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it?
Squidward	Come on, SpongeBob. Its just around the corner.
Squidward	Back... it up.
Squidward	Back it up!!
Squidward	And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold. Not the pizza! Oh, how could it get any worse?
Squidward	SpongeBob, this is no time for...
Squidward	Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?!
Squidward	Let go of that pizza!
Squidward	SpongeBob!  Hang onto the pizza!  Hey! Hey!  Wheres the road? Where's the road? We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go?  What are we gonna do now! There's no road here!
Squidward	Well, then I'm going this way.
Squidward	Give me the pizza!
Squidward	Maybe we better check on it, make sure its okay.
Squidward	What's that? Is that the cheese?
Squidward	Give me the pizza!
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over one way or another!
Squidward	That's just a stupid boulder!
Squidward	Well, this one's on the house!
Squidward	Work?  Oh, my aching tentacles!
Squidward	Are you going to order something or just make friends with the paneling?
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	My cable's out.
Squidward	Give me that!  Stealing my mail, eh? You're lucky I don't report you to the authorities!
Squidward	Good evening, sir. Table for one, please.
Squidward	One Pipsqueak patty  and your bib and highchair.
Squidward	Krakatoa!
Squidward	Krakatoa!
Squidward	No. What will you have?
Squidward	Something stupid, I'm sure.
Squidward	I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs! Where we going, Fancy Springs?
Squidward	Clam fishing? This is the reward we get for all our hard work?  Fishing for stinky clams in a smelly old boat on a filthy lagoon? You call this fun?
Squidward	Hey, watch where you're swinging that...  SpongeBob, be careful with... ow!  Okay, I've had enough.
Squidward	That's it, I'm finished! We've been here for three days and haven't gotten a nibble. This is hopeless!
Squidward	You're kidding?
Squidward	Uhh, SpongeBob, can I have a word with you? Have you noticed that Mr. Krabs has gone COMPLETELY INSANE?!
Squidward	If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat.
Squidward	Yes, why couldn't it have been you?!
Squidward	Talk to me.
Squidward	That's Tentacles!
Squidward	For Bikini Bottom's snail race. Snellie will be winning this Sunday.
Squidward	That's Tennisballs... de-derr, Tentacles! Come on, Snellie.
Squidward	What are you standing on, anyway?  Like I said, don't even bother showing up tomorrow.
Squidward	Okay, Snellie, let's show these common, garden-variety snails what superior breeding is all about.
Squidward	What?!
Squidward	Gosh, Patrick, thanks.  'The 1st Place Snail Racing Cup Presented to Squidward...  ... Will I ever win?
Squidward	Hooray.  Uh... SpongeBob, can I get one with less... fog?
Squidward	Mr. Krabs' nose hair clippers. I could use these.
Squidward	Eugene, my man.
Squidward	Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me.
Squidward	Here's the bill.
Squidward	He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!
Squidward	Yep, it is.
Squidward	Well, what can I say?  Its been great knowing you, SpongeBob. Good luck, somewhere else.   I'm gonna miss you. Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo.  Boo-hoo!
Squidward	Uh, yeah, wha-wha-whatever.
Squidward	Uh-huh. Y-you're welcome.
Squidward	Don't try to cheer me up, SpongeBob.  Please.
Squidward	SpongeBob is leaving. He's leaving, he's leaving!  la, la, la, la, la, la, la ha ha ha ha!  He leaving, ha ha!  SpongeBob is leaving, he's leaving!
Squidward	Well, it's true.
Squidward	I'm not much of a summer person, SpongeBob.
Squidward	Ho-ho, that would be great!  You've waited a long time for this! A soft bed, warm tea, a good book, and two whole days with no...   What the...?  SpongeBob! Aren't you two supposed to be camping?
Squidward	"What do you mean, ""have fun inside""?"
Squidward	You're saying I can't take it!
Squidward	Now you'll see how a real... ugh!  ...outdoorsman does it!  Here we are, my remote-controlled, self-assembling tent. Watch and learn.
Squidward	Well, you two astronauts can eat marshmallows, but I'm gonna have a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls , just as soon as I can get my can opener.
Squidward	Okay. Besides spitting molten food stuffs at me, what else do you do for fun?
Squidward	A sea bear? You mean like the ones that...  DON'T EXIST?!
Squidward	"""Sea Bears and Fairy Tales Are Real""? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!"
Squidward	You're kidding.
Squidward	Yeah, yeah, and?
Squidward	I don't know...  Just a feeling!
Squidward	Oh, pfft. Sorry, how silly of me! You mean like this?
Squidward	Thanks for the tip. I guess I'll just limp home, then.
Squidward	Okay.
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	Hmm? Oh, you fainted because you lost your name tag or something.
Squidward	Huh. Huh. A genius? Well, I don't know about that, but...
Squidward	What's all the yelling about?
Squidward	Let me guess. It's at home, under your mattress.
Squidward	Yeah, great.
Squidward	How's it going, Lieutenant?
Squidward	The Tattletale Strangler!  He's promised to strangle anyone who turns him in.
Squidward	What? That is totally unfair!
Squidward	Look at these bags under my eyes; even my bags have bags!
Squidward	Is number 5's order ready yet, SpongeBob?
Squidward	What the? Ohh!
Squidward	He and Barnacle Boy live in the retirement home on the other side of town.
Squidward	SpongeBob?
Squidward	Why do anything? I like the new Mr. Krabs. He yells at you more.
Squidward	What are you morons doing?
Squidward	Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I took care of that personally, too. I had it hauled away to the dump.
Squidward	Ooh... you did this, SquarePants! If you don't get Mr. Krabs' mattress back from the dump, I am going to murd...  ...help you do it myself.
Squidward	Okay, here's the plan: you two quietly go in there, remove the mattress out from the guard worm without... waking... the worm.
Squidward	My pleasure. Now let's gets a move on.
Squidward	I didn't do it! You blockheads woke... the... worm.
Squidward	Oh, look, you're at the far side of the dump, right?
Squidward	Coast is clear. Squiddy, you are a genius.  Ouch. What the...? Hey, I needed a wooden spoon. I'll just keep it safe from harm in my back pocket.  And now for the mattress.  I should've guessed.
Squidward	Sure, but first, put on this cologne.
Squidward	I am not going to get hurt this time.  Isn't that Mr. Krabs?
Squidward	Nope. Can I go now? One day off in three years and I have to spend it testifying?
Squidward	He's got a card.  R.A. Penny Pincher: Vending Supplies.
Squidward	Okay, if you insist.  Thanks.
Squidward	They don't call me  for nothing.
Squidward	Well, thank you for saying so.
Squidward	Hmph. I bet I win at this thing the very next time I try. Now all I have to do is
Squidward	Gee, thanks.
Squidward	Very funny, Mr. Krabs. If I can't win one of those stupid things with this quarter, I'm walking away.
Squidward	The deed to my house.
Squidward	Tell me...  the... secret.
Squidward	Yes!
Squidward	Close your eyes?
Squidward	Yes! Yes, I do!
Squidward	Whoo-hoo! Yeah! I knew I could do it!  I'm a winner!
Squidward	Make way for the winner!
Squidward	It means... you have no skills and you're a loser!  I'm a winner, see my prize! You're a loser who sits and cries!  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  Did you see how I handled that crane?
Squidward	SpongeBob, look.
Squidward	Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the
Squidward	Uh-oh!
Squidward	Oh gee, SpongeBob, that's very thoughtful of you.
Squidward	Will you two nincompoops kindly quiet down?! I am not going to let them ruin the rest of my Sunday!  My Sunday relaxation kit.  Let's seepillow.  Placed ever so for slight foot elevation. Flower--to brighten the room. Flower fragrance.  Ah, and the final touch.  Yes, I'd like to order the Sunday special. Yes, pedicure and foot massage house call, that is correct. See you at 4 my good man.  This is gonna be a heavenly day. Oh, I almost forgot.  Bon-bons. Hello there, heaven's little wonder. Take me on a chocolate vacation.
Squidward	Better?
Squidward	Polka dots! Now don't bother me anymore.
Squidward	My eyes!
Squidward	French tips, huh?  Alright, pal, make with the foot massage, pronto.
Squidward	Yes, I was! You call yourselves good neighbors?! You're the worst neighbors ever!  You don't deserve to wear those fezzes!
Squidward	"Good neighbors my right!  Hello? ""Keep Out Intruders For Good! New Security System 5000. Free Installation"""
Squidward	"""Sorry for bugging you so much""? What the? Security system, help! Intruder alert! Intruder alert! What's the matter with you?!"
Squidward	Run for your lives!  What the? What are you doing?!  I only have half an hour of me time left, and the idiots took my house. Which means those boobs aren't around to bug me. Ooh, just what I've been waiting for.  I am gonna relax if it kills me.
Squidward	Shush.
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	Heaven knows I won't.
Squidward	Happy, happy birthday.  Happy, happy bir...
Squidward	Ahoy, Eugene! Would you mind clearing this table for me?
Squidward	I really think you should look.
Squidward	What do you want, SpongeBob?
Squidward	Move over.
Squidward	No. You should sit down.
Squidward	And your temperature is 175 degrees!
Squidward	Yes, it's the part of your body that enables laughter. If you use it too long without giving it a break, it burns out and you can never laugh again.
Squidward	Gosh, SpongeBob, I'd say at least for the rest of the day. But you better go 24 hours just to be safe.
Squidward	I think I found the one thing I hate more than his laugh. I'm sure he'll cry himself out soon.  What have I done?  Oh, that's it! This charade has to end.
Squidward	Uhh, well it sounds pretty harsh when you put it that way, but yes.
Squidward	It's hilarious!
Squidward	Cut it out?
Squidward	SpongeBob?
Squidward	Well then let's make those old crabapples sizzle.  Hmmm...  Time for the art-eest to go to work.  Voila!
Squidward	Are you planning on ordering today, sir?
Squidward	Whatever.  Twelve Krabby Patties on wheat buns!
Squidward	No.  Let me guess, Tiny, a small salad?
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	Whoop-de-doo.
Squidward	I'm practicing for my clarinet recital. Soon, all of Bikini Bottom will recognize the talent that is Squidward Tentacles. Goodbye, SpongeBoob.
Squidward	Hey, what are you doing with my hand? What am I doing with your hand? Ahh! What is this? We're all mixed up together.  This is horrible. I have my clarinet recital tomorrow.
Squidward	Uhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good idea. Let's try it.
Squidward	Misery.  SpongeBob, hasn't anyone taught you how to ride a bike?
Squidward	Do you have to be such an accommodating buffoon?
Squidward	That's how we got into this predicament in the first place, you imbecile. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace.
Squidward	What'd you say?
Squidward	Superstar?
Squidward	Hmph.
Squidward	SpongeBob?
Squidward	Why would anyone stay in a hotel in Bikini Bottom? It's in the middle of scenic nowhere! There's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish.  See?
Squidward	This is a hotel now. If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service.
Squidward	Patrick, all you have to do is write your name.
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	Oh, Mr Krabs!
Squidward	Well, here's your room.
Squidward	It's a bun; it's all crust! How am I suppose to cut the crust off a bun?
Squidward	What?! Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs?
Squidward	A bubble bath?! Why would I give you a bubble bath?!
Squidward	One room, please. On the top floor.
Squidward	Spongebob, carry my things to my room.
Squidward	And I'd like to order room service. I'd like a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenail clippings, and nose hairs.
Squidward	Send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make.
Squidward	I'm impressed! These  just like mother used to make! I just wish mom was a better cook.
Squidward	Nothing like getting back to the basics.
Squidward	Nope, that's it.
Squidward	Oh, boy.
Squidward	SpongeBob, how many times do I have to tell you: I don't believe in ghosts; and I never liked you!
Squidward	Mother?
Squidward	There's no such thing as ghosts. No such thing.
Squidward	The banner's up, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	Ice sculptor? Any fool can sculpt in ice. It takes true genius to transform 400 pounds of raw Krabby Patties into a work of such majesty.
Squidward	Here she comes, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	I'm here! The King of Clarinets has arrived!
Squidward	Oh, boy.
Squidward	Can it make me famous?
Squidward	SpongeBob, why aren't those patties ready?
Squidward	Don't you have to be dead to have a memorial anything?
Squidward	Hey!
Squidward	All I can smell is that dumpster.
Squidward	Patrick's down there, too? It just gets better and better.
Squidward	Let me out of here.
Squidward	Well, why don't I just start right now? After all, I got a couple of dumbbells right here.
Squidward	It's not working, Patrick.
Squidward	Stop pushing me, Patrick.
Squidward	Patrick!
Squidward	This is idiotic.
Squidward	Not my pet rock collection.  That's it! This isn't the first time you've soiled my yard with your revolting excretions. But mark this down in your little notebook: it will be the last time!  This cheap, splintering wood will keep even Gary out. Now, I feel safe.  SpongeBob!
Squidward	I'll say. I hope he had his shots.
Squidward	Snail pox and soft shell dance?
Squidward	Well, now that you mention it, my throat is a little dry.
Squidward	Oh, yes I am.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
Squidward	Go away, SpongeBob. You're ruining my vacation...from you.
Squidward	Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again.
Squidward	Nope.
Squidward	I can't wait.
Squidward	It's about as functional as your brain.
Squidward	SpongeBob, your head is twice as large as before.
Squidward	SpongeBob, turn that noise off!  This'll get his attention.
Squidward	Great.  my reed...  is still...  stuck in my...  throat.  And it's all your fault.
Squidward	Why don't you just shrink the reed?
Squidward	SpongeBob and Patrick are piloting a miniature submarine inside my head. SpongeBob and Patrick... SpongeBob and...
Squidward	Okay, now what is this?
Squidward	Oh. Ya think?
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Get out of my body! Go!
Squidward	Well, she sure is stunning.
Squidward	SpongeBob?!
Squidward	Umm, I think I need to take a shower.
Squidward	If those two want to ruin my quiet evening at home, they're going to have to do better than that.  What?
Squidward	Can't a hard working Squid get a little TV time alone?  SpongeBob? Patrick? Oh, what's the point?
Squidward	Um... hi.
Squidward	This can't possibly end soon.
Squidward	Hey, stop!  Get me out of here!
Squidward	Ferris Wheel?
Squidward	Yeah, yeah, yeah. See, see? Uh-huh. See?
Squidward	Give me that! A treaty, huh? Well, here's what I think of your treaty!
Squidward	How can you possibly have fun with a jellyfish?  SpongeBob is the only guy I know who can have fun with a jellyfish... FOR TWELVE HOURS!
Squidward	The jellyfish don't like...? Why sure, pal, I can play better.
Squidward	Oh, my. This sounds serious. Luckily, I know just what you should do. Listen closely.
Squidward	Does that part include laughing at you? Cause you two look even more idiotic than usual.
Squidward	No! I don't want to join your biker alliance, outfits, or your fellowships.
Squidward	You are so wrong about everything, SpongeBob, that the only thing that I am completely sure about is that there is no motorcycle gang headed this way.  What was that?
Squidward	Please don't kill me. I want to join you. It's been my life-long dream to be to be a member of a motorcycle gang. I even knitted my own Wild Ones jacket.  I want to ride to live and live to ride.  I'll do whatever you want. I'll betray my friends and neighbors. Just let me live.
Squidward	That comes out to two dollars even.
Squidward	I love waking up to my own circadian rhythm without the aid of an alarm clock.
Squidward	Perhaps I can find solitude in the printed word.
Squidward	"It's called, ""I will never play with you... ever!""  ""That scoundrel!"""
Squidward	What manner of annoying scheme is this?
Squidward	SpongeBob, what is the meaning of this?
Squidward	Alright now, who has the Krabby Patty and who has the Krabby Patty?  See... 'cause... they're both... krabby.
Squidward	I'm starting to like this Mini Squid doing my work, keeping SpongeBob off my back. I could get used to this.
Squidward	Oh boy! Back to work!
Squidward	That Mini Squid.
Squidward	Wait a minute. I've seen you before. You're that music agent that represents my favorite clarinet player.
Squidward	Now, where do I sign?
Squidward	But my reed!
Squidward	And, I hate to admit it, but I suppose if you hadn't fixed my reed, the concert would have been a bust.
Squidward	What the...? Just let it go, Squidward. Let it go. Don't get involved, Squidward.  Of course.
Squidward	Yeah. I really wanna know.
Squidward	What is taking you so long?
Squidward	Good ol' Jim! When you worked here, the place had class.
Squidward	SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?
Squidward	Really?  Yes! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hee, hee, Ha! Ha!
Squidward	My hair! My beautiful hair! My hair! My hair!
Squidward	It's me, Squidward, you idiots!
Squidward	Patrick and SpongeBob? Get out of my bedroom! And give me back my tentacles!
Squidward	There. Now see?  It's supposed to do that.
Squidward	SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!
Squidward	That's no blemish!
Squidward	What was that? No, no Mr. Squidward! That can't be the Ick.
Squidward	Oh, why am I so itchy?  Oh no.  SpongeBob gave me the Ick! And I gave it to all you people!!!  Stay back, you diseased freaks!
Squidward	Hello.
Squidward	I'm on it!
Squidward	Ripping good day for a spot of driving.
Squidward	I have an important life to live, and it doesn't include chattering with you two ninnies.
Squidward	Hey, SpongeBob, could you take a look in the cash register? I think it's broken.
Squidward	Good-bye, SpongeBob.  That should buy me enough time to win that cruise.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs! That's the last customer. Do I win?
Squidward	Uh, it's just that I was going toenter your name in our sweepstakes!  So, what should I put down?
Squidward	It's on the house.
Squidward	Oh, you'll see it, Just keep looking.
Squidward	No, you don't understand. I only want the wallet for--
Squidward	But, but, but, I-I-I didn't intentionally do anything wrong.
Squidward	Call me what you may, fact of the matter is I found out the mystery customer's name first. So I win.  I win, I win, I win, I win, I win, I win!
Squidward	You mean, no vacation?
Squidward	Spill at table...
Squidward	SpongeBob? What are you doing here?
Squidward	Just saying goodnight to SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs. Sweet dreams, SpongeBob. You look much more comfier in here than in your old home next to me!.
Squidward	He still wasn't there.
Squidward	What?
Squidward	What the...? SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
Squidward	Oh, thanks a--
Squidward	I'm going to go recover from hypothermia.
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Order up.
Squidward	What the--? SpongeBob, what atrocity is this?
Squidward	Yeah. Perfect.  Simpletons.
Squidward	Oh. good-bye, paintbrush. hello, antique fitting.
Squidward	Oh, that's Plankton's wife.
Squidward	SpongeBob, where is that other oh, there it is.
Squidward	What are you going to do with it, take it home? Put a little dress on her? Go out for a romantic walk with it?
Squidward	As if on cue.
Squidward	Well, you should know considering the fact you work here, sod for brains. Speaking of sods why don't you get rid of this garbage? It's starting to stink up the joint.
Squidward	Well, I definitely see I can't the mentally atrophied. Good-bye, Creature.
Squidward	I can't take the world's greatest fry cook anymore! I'll see you in a week.
Squidward	In my bedroom?
Squidward	And that is why I will never, for as long as I live, and throughout all time and eternity, ever--
Squidward	What?
Squidward	It worked! Now I just turn on the electric fence.  Now, they'll never get back in.
Squidward	Do they have cute sea horses there?
Squidward	Good night, Bikini Bottom. I love you!
Squidward	Hello, SpongeBob.
Squidward	How's your meal? Anyone need tartar sauce? I have an idea. How about a free Krusty Krab Junior crew hat for the little tyke.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs told me to help you, so I made Krabby Patties.
Squidward	Enjoying the party, SpongeBob?  How's the cake, SpongeBob?
Squidward	What's that music?
Squidward	That'll be five dollars.
Squidward	A miracle, a marvel. It'll cook Krabby Patties at a fabulous pace.
Squidward	"Hmm, just fire SpongeBob and tell him, ""Get lost."""
Squidward	Ha, ha.
Squidward	Well, Squidward, ol' boy, all that's left is to go win that dancing trophy and give it a home. After all, nobody ever worked harder to get it than you.  All those years of training with the masters. Your tireless effort to keep your instrument supple.  Not to mention your weekly thigh waxing.  And now, it's time to go get it. So, let's do it. Whoo...!
Squidward	no, you twits. I built that trophy case for me when I win. I'm going to ace the tryouts today and then I'm going to the finals tomorrow and win the trophy. I am going forth to meet my destiny. Good-bye.
Squidward	Poor boobs, they don't stand a chance.
Squidward	Look out, dancing world, here comes your future. Music, please.
Squidward	But I, hey... Unhand me, you brutes. Ah!
Squidward	What? I've got better thinks to do than help you two dopes.
Squidward	Well, I guess that just leaves you, SpongeBob. Show me your stuff. Ready, and...  Having fun?
Squidward	Gimme those.  That's better. Ok, let's go. SpongeBob, what are you doing?  Why are you moving your arms like that?
Squidward	Ok, hand it over.
Squidward	Quit groveling. Where is your dignity?  These losers are here to worship us. I mean me. By the end of the night I'll have them on their knees just begging for more.
Squidward	Ha. If they think that's good, wait till they see...  Cramp! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Squidward	Mine!  I won, I won!
Squidward	And two orders of
Squidward	I think he's in some kind of self-induced trance.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, the only thing my life depends on is going home at 6:00.
Squidward	Well, the first reason is, I have no use of my arms. see?
Squidward	What's in them?
Squidward	Okay, how am I going to do this now? Umm  Mommy, is that you?
Squidward	Got it.  Ow.
Squidward	Now what?
Squidward	You mean to tell me you actually expect people to pay $1.98 for a rotten patty?
Squidward	No, I'm not.
Squidward	And I thought this friendship would never pay off.
Squidward	SpongeBob, do us all a favor.
Squidward	It went in my mouth! Choking on sentiment! I think I'm poisoned!
Squidward	Good people?
Squidward	Fancy? Froufrou?
Squidward	But the surly attitude he has is a step in the right direction!
Squidward	You sold me?!?
Squidward	Neptune's ascension. The only surviving painting from the great lost city of Atlantis. This is just what the doctor ordered, Squiddy. Spending your day studying the Atlantean masters. And best of all, no Sponge...  Oh, would you two watch were you're  What is that? What are you doing with the amulet of Atlantis?
Squidward	Amulet, bot omelet! It's the key to untold riches!
Squidward	That's just the oldest living bubble
Squidward	The magical path to Atlantis is a Van?
Squidward	Does that make any sense?
Squidward	You villains haven't even been here two minutes and you've already messed up someone's topiary garden.
Squidward	Help!
Squidward	I thought you'd never ask! Art is the conscious arrangement of elements in a manner that affects a sense of beauty.
Squidward	Look's like I'll be here inspiring these Atlantean art makers with my beauty. You guys go on ahead!
Squidward	Why would you want to leave a paradise like Atlantis?
Squidward	Please turn this bus around!
Squidward	Not really.
Squidward	Great?  Those little savages tried to kill me.
Squidward	You're better off not knowing.
Squidward	"Oh sure, there's none of that... Did you say ""neighbors?"""
Squidward	Drum? What drum?  This is just my wig case! See?  Come on SpongeBob, tackle me!
Squidward	Oh sure! It's a game! Get it?
Squidward	So long, chum.  And goodbye, Bikini Bottom.
Squidward	If the real estate agent sees that mess, I'll never sell this house!
Squidward	Well, that's done. At least SpongeBob has been quiet.  NO!
Squidward	Ma'am, please! What about my house?!
Squidward	Please, sell my house!
Squidward	Happy Opposite Day!
Squidward	La la la la la la la la la la la la.
Squidward	Ah, stay away! Oh, another SpongeBob nightmare.
Squidward	I think we just went through this...
Squidward	Oops, I dropped it.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, I am not interested in any-  Is that a handcrafted jewel-encrusted ornamental egg? That'll complete my collection! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward	Whoo-hoo-hoo, SpongeBob's leaving for real this time!
Squidward	He's leaving, again!
Squidward	Do you mind, I'm trying to work in a fast food restaurant. You might wanna try it sometime!
Squidward	Alright! I am gonna... Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do, but...
Squidward	How does it look?
Squidward	Quick hand me that mirror. What the...? Wait a second. That nurse was right. I am handsome!
Squidward	Huh? Well, better go greet the commoners.
Squidward	Beautiful and talented. what more do they want? Don't worry folks, there's more where that came from...Hey!
Squidward	We don't have much time! Take the door and change me back.
Squidward	Now don't hold back, SpongeBob. Just really let me have it.
Squidward	Well, SpongeBob, it was you who got me into this mess, now you have to get me out again!
Squidward	SpongeBob?
Squidward	Okay. But first let me call the mortician and tell him his uniform's been stolen.  Clothing zinger!
Squidward	So, would you like to secret-size that for two dollars more?
Squidward	Step on it!
Squidward	I was, until you called.
Squidward	Hey, that's no better than my house!
Squidward	Really!
Squidward	How'd you know about that?
Squidward	Really?
Squidward	Never mind! Maybe it won't show up on camera. Here, help me move this sofa.
Squidward	I don't need you, I can move it myself.
Squidward	Come out of there.  Uh, hang on please.  Please, just one more minute Nick!
Squidward	Why, yes. I've studied him for... years!
Squidward	What the
Squidward	Are you kidding? I've got a lot of work to do before I'm famous!
Squidward	I'm ready!
Squidward	Me too.
Squidward	A flip book?
Squidward	Uh-uh... Yes, sir?
Squidward	Going on what?
Squidward	I can hardly wait.  Phew. The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes.  Tennis shoes. I crack myself up.
Squidward	So you really want to be in the show?
Squidward	And now, poetry.  By Gary.
Squidward	Now, now, don't you worry, Mr Krabs. I've saved the best for last, you'll see.
Squidward	Yeah, show's over!
Squidward	You call this fun? This is just cheap uncultured lay sport.
Squidward	And you guys!  Do you really think that bill board is more important than my musical genius?
Squidward	Whoo-hooo! Yeah! Yeah!
Squidward	No, thank you.  I am a solitary artist.
Squidward	Become famous, revenge later. Hmm.  Come on! Be inspired!  Yes, brilliant!
Squidward	I wrote down everything I heard?
Squidward	STOP!  What could you possibly be trying to do this time?
Squidward	Yes, really! Maybe you should start being a little more NORMAL!  Doh...
Squidward	What's the meaning of this?
Squidward	Whatever. I know you're just waiting to say something stupid.
Squidward	I wonder what got into SpongeBob... And what the heck is that?!  Whose house is this?
Squidward	It sure is.
Squidward	I never thought I'd hear myself say this but please come in, SpongeBob.
Squidward	What the...?
Squidward	Wonderful weather we're having, hm?
Squidward	Looks like I'm crushing your face.
Squidward	SpongeBob?
Squidward	You know.
Squidward	The spatula
Squidward	Oh, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. That's  good.
Squidward	He'll be forced to send you home.
Squidward	I know it's hard to say goodbye.
Squidward	What? Me? Tell Mr. Krabs? Oh,  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No.
Squidward	Oh, yeah. Mr. Krabs has preturnatural instincts when it comes to situations like this. It's almost as if when something's amiss in his restaurant...  ...he can smell it.
Squidward	"Can I get my ""compersation"" now?"
Squidward	Huh? Must be hearing things... Again!
Squidward	Alright you two!  What is the meaning of this?!
Squidward	Alright you two morons! Show yourselves!
Squidward	Grrrrr...  Just get out of there!!!  Okay, that's enough! You've had your fun.
Squidward	Go away!!! Can't you idiots take a hint?!
Squidward	Don't you... I do?
Squidward	Okay!!!
Squidward	If you say so.
Squidward	>Now you're in the driver's seat Squiddy! Squidward does the slide whistle noises and isn't paying attention to the road at all.
Squidward	What up ahead?!
Squidward	Squidward, my man, you are perfect!  Oh no, my kelp garden is all wilted! Don't worry fellas, I've got just the thing to perk you up, kelp grow. Hold still.
Squidward	STOP EATING MY KELP!!!
Squidward	Are you done yet?
Squidward	Give me that!
Squidward	Hey, get back here,  and fix my nose!
Squidward	SpongeBob!  Hey! Look at what you did to me. You better fix my nose, or you'll hear from my lawyer!
Squidward	I look horrible!
Squidward	I don't want to be a giant lumbering monster!  What will I do now?
Squidward	OH, QUIET YOU MORONS!!!!!!!!!
Squidward	Yeah, sure, whatever.
Squidward	Well Squidward, I guess this is your new life.  And this is your new bed.  Good night, old life.  I'll miss you.
Squidward	What the?
Squidward	He got away, sir.
Squidward	What are you taking about, nitwit? He doesn't even have a nose!
Squidward	If you want it, you gotta go get it.
Squidward	Where do you think you're going?
Squidward	Let's give him what for.
Squidward	If I cared, I'd ask what this is about.
Squidward	GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!
Squidward	Hey, I could have sworn I had $5 in here.
Squidward	It's locked!
Squidward	What?!
Squidward	So I could get further away from you!
Squidward	Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo?  Boating school.  Oh well, it's just one day out of your life Squiddy. How bad can it be?
Squidward	won't be doing anything, because there is no we! Understand?
Squidward	Gladly.  It all started when I left my house. And then, he appeared. He made, an immediate right turn, and parked, here.  Seeing the oncoming hazard, I looked both ways, and proceeded safely toward my vehicle. It was then, that I realized that I was being followed, at an unsafe distance. So, in order to create more optimal driving conditions, I was then forced to par-take in  evasive action. And by increasing speed slightly, I created a safety cushion, while in-invertenttly attracting the attention, of said law enforcement official. May I sit down now, sweet cheeks?
Squidward	I'll have to eat over here, like in grade school.
Squidward	SpongeBob, look out!  SpongeBob, give me that wheel!
Squidward	How many times do I have to tell you?! I am not your buddy! I don't need your help, and I don't need you, ever! Now just kindly let me take this stupid test, so I can get out of here, and never have to see you again, for the rest of my life!
Squidward	SpongeBob, please? This is important.
Squidward	Before we were,  boating buddies.
Squidward	Yep, what another wonderful hum-drum day slinging burgers.
Squidward	Hello.
Squidward	Probably out enjoying this beautiful day where it was meant to be enjoyed.
Squidward	Who are you?
Squidward	SpongeBob, what are you doing with that seaweed?
Squidward	Again?!
Squidward	You're right.
Squidward	What? You call that a lesson? We just stood here and watched you surf for two and a half hours!
Squidward	That's it?! I just wanna go home!
Squidward	We're gonna be stuck here forever!!
Squidward	Here it comes!!
Squidward	Look! That's Mr. Krabs down there!
Squidward	Fi-ga-ro. Figaro!  Fi-ga-ro!  Fi-ga-ro!
Squidward	La la la la la la la!
Squidward	Well, looks like a forlorn SpongeBob sprawled out in the dirt.
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	And No You Can't
Squidward	No!
Squidward	au revoir, SpongeBob
Squidward	Huh?!
Squidward	Fi-Ga-!  I think I hit the wrong note back there  What the...?!
Squidward	Haaahaha! Figaro! FigaroFigaroFiga-roooo!
Squidward	SpongeBob, I will be late to practice with all of your tomfoolery slowing me down!  It is a high honor to be chosen for the Bikini Bottom men's chorus, and you are not going to keep me from performing my Grand Solo!
Squidward	Gentlemen.
Squidward	Ha!
Squidward	Barnacle butt.
Squidward	Sure! I'll teach ya. Listen closely now. The Vikings were....
Squidward	and enjoyed dressing up their pets as....
Squidward	And grown Vikings are known to collect socks which they display and trade at monthly sock trading conventions called Sock'n Garten.
Squidward	But what?!
Squidward	SpongeBob, there's some Vikings here to see you.
Squidward	So, let me guess. Your name must be....
Squidward	Hold it right there, whiskers! Let's not forget you're the one who dragged me onto this crate in the first place. Now, you ask me to pour my heart out, and this is the respect I get? Well, you got another thing coming, honey! I want off this boat, pronto.  On second thought, bathroom attendants make me some tips. Well, look on the bright side, Squidward. No more living next door to SpongeBob. Let her rip, Jack-o!
Squidward	You owe me big time, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	Hello, Brother Roger.
Squidward	I'll never forget my initiation ceremony.
Squidward	I can't believe it. They kicked me out of the Cephalopod Lodge.
Squidward	The last thing in my life I really enjoyed. And SpongeBob ruined it, too.
Squidward	You can look now.
Squidward	No. Why didn't you just make up your own dumb club instead of ruining mine?
Squidward	Morons.
Squidward	Oh, what now? I'm coming! What do you... Great. Must be one of SpongeBob's pranks.
Squidward	Oh, boy. Look at the time! Gotta run.
Squidward	Feather Friends?
Squidward	A sock?
Squidward	This is ridiculous, No one is dumb enough to believe SpongeBob and Patrick are a..a....giant albino eel!
Squidward	Whoa!
Squidward	Nope. .
Squidward	SpongeBob, thank you so much for that lovely invitation but I must respectfully tell you I will never visit you.  Ever!  Take heart, Squidward, it'll all be over soon. .
Squidward	A stick of butter, and just a touch of pepper...  Dyaah!  Not on the rug!  SpongeBob! Will you keep it down? I am trying to cook!
Squidward	Why do you have my vacuum cleaner?
Squidward	Yeah, probably not.  I'll be over to get my vacuum in twenty minutes.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	I-I don't even know that that is!  Please just give me my vacuum so I can get back home. I have a casserole in the oven!
Squidward	"How did he do it?  He got my coffee table, my vase, snack table, coasters, and my Art of the Clarinet Coffee Table Book.  And this pillow looks just like the one Mommy made for me. He even copied her stitch signature! ""For Squiddy, with love, Mama."""
Squidward	SpongeBob, you idiot!
Squidward	I gotta find that vacuum and get out of here!
Squidward	What happened to my house?
Squidward	Oh, no. It's that little yellow freak.
Squidward	Never seen you before in my life.
Squidward	Moron.
Squidward	But...no! Don't...
Squidward	I'm going to the bathroom.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Alright, I've had enough!  Bunch of nonsense!
Squidward	Why?
Squidward	It is... No, I mean, uh, no, no, I didn't!
Squidward	Good evening, students. Now, our first...
Squidward	My-my name? What for?
Squidward	Good. Now, why don't you take your seat and stop poking your nose into other people's business?!  Now, if we can go for five minutes without having any further interruptions. I would like to...
Squidward	Would you two numb skulls mind telling me what you're doing in music class anyway?
Squidward	As you may not be aware, music is a...  Music is a...  Music is a complicated series of...  ...is a complicated series of notes that when played in the...  SpongeBob, do you mind?! There are other people here besides you, you know. And I don't think they appreciate you depriving them of my wisdom!
Squidward	How?
Squidward	Now, I'm going to put some notes on the chalkboard.  Excuse me? Is there something you'd like to share with the rest of the class?
Squidward	I have never seen a more ridiculous looking outfit on top of anybody's head, anywhere!
Squidward	Now, where were...  ...we?
Squidward	Anyway, the metronome helps us keep time.
Squidward	Please ignore them.
Squidward	Paranormal?! The only thing paranormal around here is how fast I'm going to make you two disappear!!
Squidward	Now, I don't suppose you two have anything to say for yourselves?
Squidward	No! Wait!  No! You're not going anywhere!
Squidward	Have I told you how beautiful you are? Your tentacles, your nose, your eyes...a little lopsided.  There. And now that I've been immortalized in wax, I have conquered all artistic media. Come on, my precious reflection, smile!
Squidward	Time to find some other game to play!
Squidward	What are you two talking about?  Look what you've done to me! When I get my hands on you, I'll...
Squidward	Too hot.
Squidward	Perfect. Hmmm, I feel needy.  Slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment.
Squidward	Well, go find it again!  SpongeBob, get over here. Now spin around.  That's better. Now jog in place.  Say flank steak.
Squidward	Well, I hope you don't have any plans tonight, because you're not allowed to leave that spot until I hear a song.  What's this? Napping on the job? You're supposed to be making music for me. As punishment for this insolence, Squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room.
Squidward	Ceremony for what?
Squidward	Are you crazy? I'm not getting in that thing.
Squidward	SpongeBob!  Cut that out!
Squidward	No, I'm not bald! I'm alive! Now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home!
Squidward	D'oh!
Squidward	Why is the local news always such rubbish!?
Squidward	Krabs is gone?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	This must be important. Mr. Krabs has never interrupted one of these before.
Squidward	You know, I'll let you serve this one. My stories are on.
Squidward	See that guy over there?
Squidward	Moron.
Squidward	You're serving Krabby Patties with your hands? Do you know how filthy your hands are?
Squidward	Oh, sorry.
Squidward	Do you want to know how Mr. Krabs gets all these customers?
Squidward	Lookin' good!
Squidward	Perfect!
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Whatever.
Squidward	You want me to push you off your precarious perch into a bucket of spiny sea urchins? Oh, if only you were SpongeBob. OK, I'll do it!
Squidward	Get out!
Squidward	Whatever.
Squidward	What the?
Squidward	All right, point taken.
Squidward	Your letting SpongeBob decorate? Remember all the other times SpongeBob decorated?
Squidward	What? What are you...?
Squidward	Which one? There must be 20 ways to go.
Squidward	We'll never get out of here.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs,  Why do you have cameras watching us?
Squidward	SpongeBob, if you had never come to Bikini Bottom, this wouldn't be happening.
Squidward	My secret garden is finally done.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Ow!
Squidward	We went through all that for nothing?!
Squidward	Laa da dee, laa da da, laa da doo. Got ya. Now just one quick flick of the wrist, and
Squidward	Who's that?
Squidward	Hmm, I'll have to think about that.
Squidward	Oh, boy. How about some of those games you promised?
Squidward	One, two, three.
Squidward	What do you mean, you're not seeing anything?! There's three in a row right here. Tic-tac-toe!
Squidward	It's the last piece of the puzzle! There's only one place it can go. Right here!
Squidward	No, I can't.
Squidward	"Shh. Quiet time. It's a game called ""boundaries."""
Squidward	It's very simple. The object of the game is to see how long everyone leaves Squidward alone until the storm passes. He will stay inside boundaries, he'll define by chalk lines on the floor.
Squidward	Brilliant work, as usual, Squidward. Now all I have to do is sit here until this storm blows over.  Wait a minute. I'm starving. SpongeBob's got to have some snacks around here somewhere. Ah, Jackpot.  I bet you wish you had some of this, don't? Snail food?  I've got to get some real food.
Squidward	Oh, thank you. I'm just so hungry.
Squidward	But all I wanted was something to eat.
Squidward	Is this what we've really come to? Is one little storm all it takes to turn us all into complete animals?
Squidward	The storm must've stopped.
Squidward	Not in the least, SpongeBob.
Squidward	Well, it wouldn't be the first time you've ruined everything, but the worst part is those 5,000 Krabby Patties that will end up going rotten in the hot sun.
Squidward	Go on.
Squidward	Careful, this is made out of imported wood, imported all they way from the junk pile out the back.
Squidward	What the?
Squidward	No, no, no. Take your time. It's worth the wait.
Squidward	He obviously doesn't know the first thing about music! This is an outrage!
Squidward	Do they just give a show to just anybody over there?
Squidward	Like, I would tell you! Hmph...  Although, I've waited my whole life to have enough glory to rub it in someone's face. Anyone's face.  Even that face. Okay! I'll tell you, but the last thing I would want is for you to show up so plug your ears!  Well, I don't want to toot my own whistle, but... Wait, no! That's exactly what I mean to do!  Oh!
Squidward	Moron. As I was saying, today, on Squidward Chat, we'll be discussing...
Squidward	If you want to be on TV, you have to be in front of the camera!
Squidward	That means you take all the pretty pictures.
Squidward	Now then, I was going to tell you about my fabulous...  Sponge...!
Squidward	Nooo! My show!
Squidward	Me?
Squidward	That's funny. Even a barnacle knows you need music to dance.
Squidward	You got a dance audition?
Squidward	Hmm...
Squidward	By the time that idiot gets back, he'll be too tired to dance!
Squidward	Huh? Huh? What, is he still at it?  Huh?  My treadmill!
Squidward	Okay, try this.  It's simple.  And a real showstopper.  Pay close attention.  Now you.
Squidward	Then go and practice it, and don't stop until you've done exactly as I did.
Squidward	Aw, come on, now. After all I've done for you? We've got one day, SpongeBob.
Squidward	Good night, sweet prince, and hello, stardom for yours truly.
Squidward	Oh, baby, I knew it!  You won't be sorry you made this decision.
Squidward	I don't care. I'm calling the police.
Squidward	You'll what? You'll give me your golden tooth?
Squidward	Well, I must say, it really completes your imbecile look. Way to go, buddy.
Squidward	SpongeBob, where's the Krabby Patty for order 17?
Squidward	What are you doing?
Squidward	SpongeBob, don't you know that award's a scam?
Squidward	That's right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you.
Squidward	I already told you, that award is a bunch of...  ...baloney!
Squidward	I'm telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke!
Squidward	You're a lunatic, SpongeBob!
Squidward	Don't bother; I'll have done it already by the time you get there!
Squidward	No, how about you?
Squidward	SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
Squidward	So long, Sponge loser!  SpongeBob? Truce?
Squidward	Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile. You can't trust him as far as you can throw him.
Squidward	Flowers and chocolate for you, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward	SpongeBob, order  up.
Squidward	So?
Squidward	P.U, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward	No, and I want you to stop calling me Squidsy.
Squidward	I don't care! Now get back in the kitchen!
Squidward	Ignoring, ignoring!  Chewing gum!? That's disgusting!  Oh c'mon!  People who litter really bug me!  Litterbugs  Litterbugs!
Squidward	What? No! no no, I just stepped in it!
Squidward	Can things get any worse?
Squidward	Hmph! I'll clean up Bikini Bottom in a day!
Squidward	Hey! Hold on! Stop! I'm not the garbage man!  Help.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Listen closely, I don't need your help! I would rather be beaten to a pulp!
Squidward	Why?
Squidward	Oh this is so stuuuuuu...  ...pid. It's gone! Where did you put the trash?
Squidward	Yes.
Squidward	How?
Squidward	Neptune no!
Squidward	Really?!  Garbage. I'm made of garbage
Squidward	Adorable.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Please.
Squidward	Ahh. La-da-dee-la-da-dum-la-da-doo!
Squidward	No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! You morons would probably...  You want to play with my lawnmower?
Squidward	I knew I shouldn't have lent them my lawnmower.
Squidward	Not a problem SpongeBob, not a problem at all!
Squidward	Even better, I have a clarinet recital immediately after work today! So ain't nothing gonna ruin my day.
Squidward	This is unacceptable!
Squidward	You ever read this?
Squidward	Ohh, I suppose I can share but only since it requires by law. Hey! This thing is filthy! You don't expect me to clean it?!
Squidward	Order up, SpongeBob!
Squidward	And here's your change, mam.
Squidward	If you smashed my clarinet-- so help me, Neptune-- I will
Squidward	What's he doing?!
Squidward	My clarinet! SpongeBob!
Squidward	a note?!
Squidward	Another note?!
Squidward	What have you done to my-
Squidward	Hey, come back! I need my clarinet! Come Back! Where are you? Sponge-
Squidward	You calling me a liar?!
Squidward	Stand still you idiot!
Squidward	You tell me what in the wide world of sports is this place? And how did you get so big?
Squidward	Almost... Gotcha!
Squidward	Where did you get that?!
Squidward	Ahh!
Squidward	"I'm too busy telling you, ""NOOOOOOO!"""
Squidward	I don't care what it is! I'm out of here!
Squidward	Not this time, little fella.
Squidward	Yeah, but for some reason, I don't think they're here to trade gift baskets!
Squidward	What are you supposed to be?
Squidward	That SpongeBob is such a crybaby. And lucky me I get to work with him all day.
Squidward	All right, look. So far today, and it's not even 2:00 yet, you have cried 43 times.
Squidward	Au contraire.
Squidward	Fine. If you cry one tear before midnight, you have to...  Wash my bike, clean out my rain gutters, and do all my yard work for a year.
Squidward	Do what?  Oh, my! What a lovely sunset. Take a look, SpongeBob.  Isn't that beautiful?
Squidward	Nice of you to have me, I-- Oh, look SpongeBob. Gary's sleeping.
Squidward	Your mail's here. Ooh, oh look, it's a postcard from your dear mother and father so far away.
Squidward	Ooh, let's turn it up.
Squidward	What would you say to a little music?
Squidward	You're not gonna cry though, are you?
Squidward	Umm...  How 'bout The Little Angler Who Got Lost?
Squidward	You're exactly right, SpongeBob. Let it all out. Don't fight the feel-- Ten, nine...do it, do it, cry...eight, seven, six, five...come on!  ...four, three, two, one!  Midnight!  Well, SpongeBob, it looks like you won the...
Squidward	Hooray! Yahoo!
Squidward	Whoop...
Squidward	So long, losers!
Squidward	So it is with great pleasure that we announce we will not be doing your play.
Squidward	Dinner theater?
Squidward	You got all the parts.
Squidward	Places, people, places!
Squidward	Raise the curtain!
Squidward	Fine.
Squidward	No, you ca-
Squidward	His life shattered. Is there any task too demeaning for our hero?
Squidward	And then, there's my skinflint boss.
Squidward	You don't have any lines!
Squidward	Outstanding. Thank you, that'll do. Ahem. But, lo and behold-
Squidward	And furthermore!
Squidward	Uh huh.
Squidward	Doh! I said if it hit YOU in the face!
Squidward	Dont worry, SpongeBob. Just wait right here.  Ill get my emergency squirrel rescue kit!
Squidward	: SpongeBob, you have been warned about lurking back here on your days off!
Squidward	Keep looking. You'll find someone who cares.
Squidward	Alert the what?
Squidward	What's a Gary?
Squidward	Go away?  You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?
Squidward	Friday, Saturday and Sunday. A three-day weekend.
Squidward	I have the memory of an elephant, I'll take good care of Fred.
Squidward	Come on, eat! Eat! Eat!  Ohh...
Squidward	So, uhh, well, see you. Good-bye.
Squidward	Okay, okay, I'll do it.
Squidward	Oh, nothing, it's just a little snail plasma.
Squidward	Oh, how touching. I'm going to go home and throw up. Good night.
Squidward	SpongeBob? Oh, Neptune, what have I done?  It's all your fault.  Okay, okay, okay, okay, get it together, Squidward.
Squidward	Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow  .
Squidward	Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow ..
Squidward	Drama queen.
Squidward	Oh no, is that a mermaid song?
Squidward	Oh, my neck.
Squidward	He looks fine to me.
Squidward	Hey!! Closed means closed, Grandma!  Oh boy, Some people...
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Ah-ha, that is what they cost...20 years ago. Krabby Patties cost $4.50, lady.
Squidward	Or before he takes off his sleep mask.
Squidward	That's not a curse.  That's a blessing.
Squidward	Hold that thought.  SpongeBob, what is all that r...
Squidward	I've seen what he cleans the grill with.
Squidward	Oh is that supposed to be singing?  I am putting that one on SpongeBob.  Would you clam up, SpongeBob? I am trying to paint in here!
Squidward	Keep you and your gratitude to yourself! Because having you as a neighbor has left me with nothing to be grateful for!
Squidward	Moron.  Stupid pipe!  Oh, great. I'm late for work, again!
Squidward	Stop staring, SpongeBob.
Squidward	Oh, please do, I'm trying to get some work done here. Sheesh, some people just want to waste your time.  Hey, buddy, how am I supposed to focus with all of that insesant tapping? And what do you think you're doing, sir?
Squidward	How could life in Bikini Bottom POSSIBLY get any worse?
Squidward	But, Squidward, it is imperative that we...  NOTHING! I think I'd rather take my chances with the volcano than be stuck in this miserable barnacle hole with you, [] and the citizens of Dumb-Dumb Town!
Squidward	Stop playing...
Squidward	Must... block... out... noise!
Squidward	My house!
Squidward	Why were you digging under my yard?
Squidward	RRRRRRRR!
Squidward	RRRRRRRRRRRR!
Squidward	Th-ree!
Squidward	I hate neighbors.
Squidward	Whatever.
Squidward	"""Hmm. Oh, whatever shall I donate to the time capsule? Golly, this is hard! How about  this lamp?! It's  perfect!"""
Squidward	Right. This plate is actually  meant to be eaten on. Now with your permission, I'd like to perform a few tests to verify its authenticity.
Squidward	Next.
Squidward	Get off me!
Squidward	Hello, future!  Yes! Huh? What the...?! Where's my museum? The future is the same as my old pathetic life! Forget this! I'm waiting another 50 years!
Squidward	Hm.  Wow. Those two are just so amazingly stupid.
Squidward	A nine-letter word for annoying: SpongeBob.  Ugh.  Finally. Some peace and quiet.  No more SpongeBob, Just me, myself and home sweet home.  Ahh. Nothing like a squid's good ol' chair to soothe the pains of a rough day. Just relax and contemplate some me time.  Perhaps I will dance to some soothing dance records.  Or I could dabble a little on painting!  Yup. I sure am looking forward to it.
Squidward	Advanced rules.
Squidward	Good night... lamp.
Squidward	It's, it's, it's... beautiful! it's a mirage! I knew it!
Squidward	Remember, just go with it.
Squidward	I've never felt this happy in my life!
Squidward	Yeah, make it last,
Squidward	I wonder who that could be.
Squidward	No!  Huh?
Squidward	No!
Squidward	No!
Squidward	What?  D'oh...!
Squidward	A-ha! They're finally gone!  What the...?  Locked?! Oh no! Oh, well, someone will realize I'm gone and come looking for me. I'll be out of here in no time.
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Are the other letters of the alphabet involved here?
Squidward	Well, I wouldn't've chosen this interior...  Oh, what's this? Well, if SpongeBob exists in the future, I'd better go to the past!
Squidward	I gotta get outta of here!  Where's the time machine?! Where's anything? Where, where, where, where?!  I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I miss Bikini Bottom! I miss my Easter Island head! I even miss SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! Patrick!
Squidward	I'm going back.
Squidward	Would you stop that incessant babbling!?
Squidward	I'll cleanse myself by listening to a little public radio.
Squidward	Great, now I hate two things.
Squidward	Alright. I'll do it. But only because you required an artist of such high talent.
Squidward	That was a near little tune I came up with today, if I do say so myself.
Squidward	No!
Squidward	Shut it SpongeBob. Gil is about to reveal his secret.
Squidward	He's talking about me.
Squidward	Unfortunately, that precludes me from doing any commercial pieces. Good-bye.
Squidward	(sighs) All right, Krabs, I'll do it. But I will need complete artistic control.
Squidward	I'll need an assistant.
Squidward	I'm gonna be famous.
Squidward	Nope.
Squidward	Nope.
Squidward	All done. (the spoon and fork break into pieces and Mr. Krab's left arm snaps)
Squidward	This is a masterpiece.
Squidward	It is not a doohickey, it's art!
Squidward	Yep, that's one angry mama.
Squidward	Gesundheit.
Squidward	Can you two be quiet?!
Squidward	It must very challenging for you!
Squidward	Just pick one! And there's another three where that came from!
Squidward	Sigh...Once in awhile, I need to breathe in and not smell grease. Or the stench of my miserably failed life...Talking to myself...again...
Squidward	Pinch yourself you ninny.
Squidward	Being hired.
Squidward	SpongeBob, I never thought I'd be saying this, but, count me in!
Squidward	It only seems to have increased their appetite for wieners.
Squidward	Well, I guess I was wrong again. It can always get more humiliating.
Squidward	"Hmm, a gum wrapper and a coin that says ""Mauna Loa""."
Squidward	Welcome to The Wreck of the Mauna Loa. Arr. How may I help you?
Squidward	I'm going to pretend that didn't happen.  Now fill these orders or leave, SpongeBob. We're very busy today!
Squidward	Go!
Squidward	Drrrrrgh! All right, what's going on out here? I can't even hear myself think!
Squidward	Shut it! What are you two dingbats doing?
Squidward	Oh great, now another idiot can move in.
Squidward	"It's because I was planning to do ""No such thing""! See?"
Squidward	Sorry, you're too late.
Squidward	The bassoon?
Squidward	"Wow, his designs are impeccable!  Yes, I do feel ""at home""."
Squidward	Well, that's nice!
Squidward	Oh no!
Squidward	No! I can't let you do that!
Squidward	Um, form a little duet together. Just you and me. Just the two of us. Together. You know. Me on clarinet and you on bassoon. Why sure!
Squidward	Uh, that's me! I think this reed needs replacing. Excuse me for a moment!  There! Now, where were we?
Squidward	Please don't leave, Howard! You're the rain of sunshine I've had in years!
Squidward	Well, I almost had a decent neighbor.
Squidward	Even the illiterate find love.  Oh, Squidward, why are you torturing yourself with tales of romance?
Squidward	Great, let the tired cliches cascade forward.  That'll make me feel better.
Squidward	SpongeBob, she's got it all! Class, style, grace, and looks like yours truly!
Squidward	She's talking to me. What do I do?
Squidward	Okay.
Squidward	That's it! I'll go on...  a practice date?
Squidward	Um...You look...stunning?
Squidward	Oh, right! I'll get my car.  Hop in!  What?
Squidward	Can we go now?
Squidward	Okay.
Squidward	You're a real piece of work, you know that?
Squidward	Excuse me, but how is this supposed to help me with my real date?  Which, by the way begins in five minutes.
Squidward	Don't interrupt me! And don't call me, look at me, write me, or even think of me! Cause you and I, we are not friends! And never will be.
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	Well, I hope she's not as obnoxious as you.
Squidward	This is way beyond my property line. Hey Patrick, that oaf makes a better bulldozer than a sister!  Construction humor.
Squidward	Look what  done?!
Squidward	You can blecor-decorate until the sea cows come home for all I care, just don't use my property to do it!
Squidward	Who cares what you think?! if it's destruction they want, then it's destruction they'll get!
Squidward	See for yourself!
Squidward	I don't hear a thing, but something stinks.
Squidward	As if working here wasn't bad enough, now I've been injured on the job.
Squidward	Ow! [] GET AWAY FROM ME!!! Well, this is it! I'm reporting you to the OWS!
Squidward	And another one for my foot. Fluff it.
Squidward	And also, looks like you'll have to take over for me.
Squidward	I'm waiting!
Squidward	"""Excuse me, sir."
Squidward	What are you going to do to me?
Squidward	Because then you'd only get to repair it once.
Squidward	It'll cost you money.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, I am getting really tired of running back and forth. I find it both exhausting and time consuming.
Squidward	Not that I can hear.
Squidward	Nobody huh? Ok, I'll just toss it in the trash.
Squidward	It's for my ear-replacement surgery! We need a real microphone and speaker!
Squidward	The microphone!
Squidward	That's nice. That's interesting.
Squidward	No no no! Not that window! The other one!
Squidward	For once, he's right!
Squidward	Hey! Hello?! Nitwit, morons.
Squidward	Just don't let it happen again! Or else.
Squidward	Wha-What?
Squidward	You're sentimental about your sweat?
Squidward	It's Squidward.
Squidward	Dress? It is not a dress, it's a nightshirt. If you don't get rid of this trash, I'm calling the sanitation police.
Squidward	No, it's not my home! It belongs to that filthy little dirtbag!
Squidward	Really?
Squidward	You really miss them?
Squidward	Oh, good grief.
Squidward	IT'S A NIGHTSHIRT!!
Squidward	Sponge-  Bob...
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
Squidward	Hello, people of Bikini Bottom! I'm glad I'm finally talking to my fans on  television!
Squidward	No! Singing!
Squidward	Oh... not again...
Squidward	Wait what?!
Squidward	And everybody knows that grown-ups never play with kids! And on that note, I would like to personally commend the sea star for taking his first baby steps into the adult world! Facial hair is a good start I suppose.
Squidward	In the hopes that a quiet, grown-up neighborhood will prevail at last. Moving me one step closer to peace and blissy tranquility. A place where I can-
Squidward	Wow, that actually makes sense. It must be working already!
Squidward	We may have to find you clothes as well.
Squidward	Ahem!
Squidward	Indeed...
Squidward	Yeah... yes I suppose it does...  SpongeBob! Get down from there right now!
Squidward	SpongeBob! The only thing that must be done is cutting the cord with you!
Squidward	You only gone up three stairs!
Squidward	Certainly
Squidward	Terrible!
Squidward	SpongeBob, why aren't those orders up yet? . SpongeBob, the collective blood sugar around here is dangerously low.  Why are you grilling index cards?
Squidward	SpongeBob, what is that horrible racket coming from back here?
Squidward	Fish flute?
Squidward	Who said that?
Squidward	You will not get me to eat at the Chum Bucket, no matter how big the discount is.
Squidward	Nope.
Squidward	Finally, someone actually appreciates my brilliance. I will play for you, my tiny cyclops. I will play such that Neptune himself will hear me upon his very throne... or whatever chair he's sitting on.
Squidward	I'm so glad you're enjoying the performance.
Squidward	It's all in the wrist.
Squidward	It is an unfortunate truth.
Squidward	Nope. Haven't seen a thing.
Squidward	In fact, thanks to you, I'm going to quit my job at the Krusty Krab and become a full-time musician.
Squidward	La da de, la da dum, la da doo. La da dee. Ah, it's a great day for the art world.  Famous art critic Fredrick T. Nitpick will be critiquing my latest masterpiece. I love hearing myself talk.
Squidward	Yes, i'm an artist! What are you two bubbleheads doing anyway?
Squidward	Hate.
Squidward	No, wait, come back!
Squidward	Oh, , selling one lousy piece doesn't make you an artist!
Squidward	I'll bet
Squidward	One Krabby Patty
Squidward	Off the menu? Choose something off the menu! We don't serve artistic advice here!
Squidward	Beautiful.
Squidward	Ha and ha!
Squidward	That will be $6.75 please.
Squidward	And you just happened to bring that with you... to the Krusty Krab?
Squidward	I don't see any signs of ghosts  Nothing here but a bunch of tacky, old furniture, and boring, representational art.  Huh?
Squidward	I guess this is the part where I start screaming.
Squidward	No, I mean actual bones.
Squidward	Hmhmhmhm...
Squidward	Kelpy's not for everyone.
Squidward	Oh yeah. I show you the ticket, and then through some manner of folly, you destroy it!
Squidward	Ah, so nice to be surrounded by such kindred spirits.
Squidward	Come on, SpongeBob. SpongeBob's obnoxiousness is ostracizing me from all these other fans. Somehow I gotta give him to slip.
Squidward	It's right behind you SpongeBob!
Squidward	See you after the show, Spongee-G.
Squidward	Don't mind if I do groove.
Squidward	Oh, boy.
Squidward	"Two words, Patrick ""get lost."""
Squidward	Hey, come back here with those backstage passes.
Squidward	Yeah, I got a problem. Those are my seats, you numbskull. I'm gonna rant for a while. You're just gonna sit there, aren't ya?  You're not gonna move along. We waited long and hard for this  Tonight's ruined. A complete disaster. And I didn't even meet Kelpy G.
Squidward	Oh, please, please, let me see him. Please. Please. Please!
Squidward	This isn't fair. I should be on stage, not SpongeBob. I'm the mega-talent. I'll show you, Kelpy.  But I'm a musician!
Squidward	Of..of course.  What...what...what is it?
Squidward	I said what?
Squidward	SpongeBob! Twenty more orders here!
Squidward	Would you please get your friend out of my house?
Squidward	Phew...
Squidward	What in the name of Neptune is going on-
Squidward	Cala-what?
Squidward	No.  I said  I will not walk to work with yo--!
Squidward	Well let's see, maybe 'cause I have a brain.
Squidward	Now now. Calm down. I've should've given this to you a long time ago!
Squidward	Oh if I ignore it, maybe it will go away.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs! This will not stand!
Squidward	No!
Squidward	Hello...you...
Squidward	PATRICK!!!
Squidward	How long you want to live?
Squidward	NO
Squidward	Quit bellyaching and hand me a pen.
Squidward	...And adding someone who is much more deserving!
Squidward	Oh, for dolphins sakes!! Do tell what's troubling you so!
Squidward	That'll keep him out of my hair.  Of course, he actually has one.  To each, his own.
Squidward	That's not garbage, it's a Fiasco!
Squidward	This is an authentic Fiasco!
Squidward	You tried to throw it away!  It's mine!
Squidward	Hey, don't I get a phone call?
Squidward	GRR...
Squidward	Ummm, let me think...    I guess I don't have a happiest memory. Oh, well.
Squidward	I hear you crying all the time.
Squidward	Really? Do you think you can?
Squidward	Hey, this isn't so bad. I think I actually feel kinda...happy!
Squidward	Great... I get to see all the art of people who have succeeded where I've failed. My art will never be shown in this...   What the? This... this is my sculpture! How did it get here?
Squidward	Gosh! Fiasco himself is talking about my art!
Squidward	Very nice... except that I'm AFRAID OF HEIGHTS!
Squidward	Time to face facts. I'll never have a happiest memory.  And if I do, it definitely won't involve you.  Hello misery... I'm home...  I might as well go to bed for a hundred years or so.  Wake me when I'm dead...
Squidward	I can't seem to get happy...  Maybe this will help.  Nope... I guess not...  Oh great... I wonder who that could be...  You're not SpongeBob.
Squidward	You don't seem to understand.  I... don't... WANT... A... HAPPIEST MEMORY!
Squidward	I quit!
Squidward	Ow
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order, beep, beep?
Squidward	Best day at work ever!
Squidward	Let's try a new game. Let's combine whatever you get out of whatever this is you're doing with the quiet of sleep!
Squidward	: Come on SpongeBob! Chop, Chop!
Squidward	- Face Freeze! I thought that was a myth. ha! Krabs too! ha ha ha!! (Begins laughing hard) This is rich!Ha ha ha! Oh. Hey, my face. Ah my face! Oh, great, look at what you've done.
Squidward	Well, time to go.
Squidward	What's the big deal? It's only garbage?
Squidward	Yes, by all means, take it.  Hello?
Squidward	Get out!
Squidward	How can anyone have fun with just a piece of paper?  Ohh...what can he possibly be doing with that paper?!
Squidward	Do a big yellow idiot with a stupid piece of paper.  How did he do that?
Squidward	What did you...
Squidward	What? I didn't play any wrong notes.
Squidward	I never said anything like that!
Squidward	Wait, wait, maybe we can trade for something.  Yeah-yeah, something, something...  A-ha, wait up, SpongeBob! Wait! Hold on there, chum.  I'm going to make you an offer.
Squidward	Listen, you!  You are not going anywhere until we strike a deal.  Gotta get that paper.
Squidward	Okay, the shirt!  Take it! Take my shirt!
Squidward	Does anybody have any sunscreen?
Squidward	Worse? How?
Squidward	Huh? Oh, SpongeBob. I'm suddenly not feeling very well.
Squidward	Name? Oh, uh. Per, swees, swer, square, uh, squid's disease.
Squidward	SpongeBob? SpongeBob.  What are you doing back there?
Squidward	The what?
Squidward	But Mr. Krabs...
Squidward	But the customers. You don't want them to get sick, do you?
Squidward	And just what is that supposed to be?
Squidward	Hiiii, SpoooongeBooooob.
Squidward	Oh, of course. It's not like I'm busy working or anything.
Squidward	Yippee! Thank you, Mr. Krabs! I mean
Squidward	Well, so much for enjoying the great outdoors. But at least I can relax and enjoy  some afternoon tea.
Squidward	Oh would you look at that. I'm suddenly feeling much better. I think I'm going back to work now, bye.
Squidward	SpongeBob!  Thanks?
Squidward	Stringing lights so Santa knows, in no uncertain terms...toGO AWAY!!!
Squidward	I said I'm not home!  SpongeBob, give me back my door!
Squidward	What's seems to be the problem? Well, well, well,  if it isn't Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob. Now just follow me. I believe I have a table reserved just for you.  Bon Appetit, Suckers!  See you in two years!
Squidward	Are you not seeing the line of people out there?! What's the hold-up with the new batch of Fricassee?!
Squidward	What are you doing here?
Squidward	My fan base!()
Squidward	What?
Squidward	I try not to look directly at the customers.
Squidward	It's about time! Where have you been? I'm outta here!
Squidward	Maybe I'll...practice my clarinet.
Squidward	The day I willingly practice my musical art with you is the day I grow hair on my...
Squidward	Yes he said money, but more importantly he said faaaannnnnnssss!!! And not the type that blows air if you're feeling too hot! The type that wants autographs on everything they got!
Squidward	Sounds like a load of hooey...
Squidward	It's not even my restaurant and somehow I regret that decision...
Squidward	Oh yeah...they got one foot in the rave. Heh heh...reaper jerks!
Squidward	Supermarket openings, retirement homes! What's next a child's birthday party!  This is our WORSE gig yet: Children parties! Well if this is the way this tour is being organized, then I would like to...OOOOOOOOW!!!!  I AM NOT DONKEY-FISH!!!
Squidward	Well then, where is it!?
Squidward	"Isn't that...what you were talking about?  Ah...just soak on in Squidy old boy! Pretty invigorating isn't it? Wait a minute...why are they chanting ""Ned and the Needlefish?"""
Squidward	In fact, they're still going wild...
Squidward	No no! Wait! Let me guess: You ate the spare tire?
Squidward	Forget it! I'll just walk!
Squidward	Don't...
Squidward	I should probably give up! On this giving up today! This is the part I turn around and play!
Squidward	It's quitting time, SpongeBob. Go home.  Quitting time!  GO HOME!
Squidward	Barnacles!
Squidward	What the? Where am I? What's going on?
Squidward	Stop! Not another word about this! Ever!
Squidward	Welcome to the Krusty--  Well, there goes my nap. Multiple orders up! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! Where are you! You need to get out here and make those Krabby Patties.  SPONGEBOB!!!  Get it together, SpongeBob. The dining room is full of ravenous customers.
Squidward	Nothing ever happens in this dump...
Squidward	What!?
Squidward	I think I'm gonna be sick!
Squidward	Phew...
Squidward	Well... no. I have more important things to do.
Squidward	Hurry SpongeBob!
Squidward	SpongeBob, this is serious! I was just viciously attacked!
Squidward	Can't we just get on with this SpongeBob?
Squidward	"That's it!? THAT'S the ""totality"" of your karate mastery?"
Squidward	Yeah, fine.
Squidward	A board? I wasn't attacked by a piece of wood! I was assaulted by a deranged lunatic!
Squidward	Arg! This is stupid! The only thing this manic threw at me were his big, meaty fists!
Squidward	Groceries? You'll have to pull my groceries from my cold, wet tentacles bucko! Take this! Hiyah!Huh? Think that's going to stop me!? You're not getting me without a fight! HIYAH!Got you... right where...I want you! Vengeance... is... MINE!
Squidward	Phew! All finished!
Squidward	Hah hah! I can't believe I did it!
Squidward	Let me give him a taste! A mere morsel of what's in store!  Hee-YAH!  HEE-YAH!Hiyah! That one was called Washing Sandy's Windows! Stay back or you're gonna get it! I am warning you! Okay buddy, I warned ya! I like to call this one Taking Out Sandy's Trash! Hee-YAH!
Squidward	My finishing move! I give you Watering Sandy's Lawn! Hee-YAH!
Squidward	Yes I am!
Squidward	And don't forget these.
Squidward	Stay back, you ravenous brutes. Oh!
Squidward	I don't know and I don't care!  Hold it!  What I want to know is why you two have ruined my attempts of having an even tan!
Squidward	Thanks, goo!
Squidward	That's nice...and...interesting...
Squidward	I told those muttonheads not tosee that movie. [walks into his house]
Squidward	There's just no sport in it.
Squidward	Well, try to contain yourself. We have a customer.
Squidward	Keep that up and you'll lose consciousness. Tentacles crossed.
Squidward	Minding it for  which customer?
Squidward	Nice working conditions, but, no thanks!
Squidward	"It doesn't matter what you ""want"" me to do, I won't do it!"
Squidward	You sure it's not  you're smelling?
Squidward	What? What? What? Wha... huh?
Squidward	I almost feel sorry for the little nimrod.  What the? Do you mind?
Squidward	Have you lost it, SpongeBob?!
Squidward	Take off that phony suit, Mr. Krabs! You're not fooling anybody!
Squidward	You mean the sound of my own flesh sizzling to a crisp?
Squidward	Nuh-uh.
Squidward	Fired?
Squidward	Okay, that's enough. It's closing time.  You know, it just won't be the same around here without you. You'll have to visit sometime...  As a customer.  Buh-bye now. Sayonara. Good riddance.  Man, is it gonna be sweet without that pest around!  This day couldn't get any better.  Well, Eugene, let me commend you on a terrific business decision. But now that SpongeBob's gone, who will be running the grill?
Squidward	I'm afraid so.  SpongeBob...
Squidward	Hmm.  Not exactly my color.
Squidward	I wasn't waiting.
Squidward	SpongeBob, look.  We're walking in a straight line.
Squidward	Oh, for the last time  straight line, point A, there's no shortcut!
Squidward	Look, the Krusty Krab is right at the end of the block!
Squidward	Ahhhh....
Squidward	You don't say. How's that shortcutting going?
Squidward	I'm as neat as a pin? I'll show you neat as a pin!  Where's my bubble bath, Mr. Krabs?!
Squidward	None taken.
Squidward	Would you like fries with that?
Squidward	I'm busy.
Squidward	"What's ""busy busy?"""
Squidward	Perfectly brown toast points.  Sparkling kelp juice.  Here's to me!  D'oh! That simpering buffoon!
Squidward	Wait. I thought you were some other idiot.
Squidward	Plus one! Oh yeah, of course! Plus one!  Sure!  What's a plus one?
Squidward	No, not like you!
Squidward	Hm. Yeah, I wonder if I still have my receipt for this thing. No big deal. Anybody can make a friend by...  TONIGHT?!  Let's see. There must be someone who's a real part of your life, Squidward. Who do you see every single day? Who do you know like the back of your suction cups?
Squidward	That wasn't the question. Which way did the mailman go?
Squidward	I love introverts! Why I'm an introvert!
Squidward	Oh, delicious food is my favorite kind of food! Especially when that delicious food is something you can...
Squidward	Yeah, I know it... What?
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	Well, it's, uh, kind of hard to put into words.
Squidward	What the heck?
Squidward	You know, you're alright, Lester.
Squidward	"Oh, come on. It's a fat. You don't wanna be one of those mindless rubes who marches around in a constant haze of stupidity. ""I love protein shakes. I'm the most gullible rube on the planet. Duh! Duh! Duh! Give me my stupid protein shake."""
Squidward	I guess it's just you and me again.
Squidward	Just get me out of here!
Squidward	Would you be my plus one?
Squidward	: Oh, yeah. They're a riot. What can I get ya?
Squidward	: Oh, I'm sorry sir. The executive treatment is available to executives only. I'm not sorry.
Squidward	: Not on its own, no. But you could Krabby-size the tie with and get a pair of business glasses for additional 10 dollars.
Squidward	:  Here you go.
Squidward	PICKLE JUICE! Oh, my eye!
Squidward	What's going on in here?
Squidward	Well, I guess things will pick up once the food gets here.
Squidward	Do not say it!
Squidward	Delicacies?
Squidward	Whoo!
Squidward	You mean the guy who's been nursing a single fry for the last hour?
Squidward	Wait, you were transporting suntan lotion?  What SPF?
Squidward	Let me think. No idea.
Squidward	I can't believe that I had to do my job's and SpongeBob's.
Squidward	SpongeBob, is that you?
Squidward	One snail I can handle. Maybe even two or three. But this? Geesh, no way! Just how many snails do you have?
Squidward	He said like two hundred and fifty-eight! Well, do something about it! That's why I pay taxes!  Oh, my allergies are killing me.
Squidward	Don't worry, it's not a problem! Any idiot can do it, right?
Squidward	Oh, quit messin' around and just break down the gate!
Squidward	This is the day he gets the patty orders for the big Founder's Day eating contest, it's the most money Krabs makes all year.
Squidward	He's the current champion. He only needs to eat one patty to win.
Squidward	No, you ninny! Somebody makes them.
Squidward	Your operative word there is think.
Squidward	Uh-huh.
Squidward	Tic-Tac.
Squidward	"I don't see the point to this game night. Every game that Patrick has ""invented"" is more pointless and boring than the last."
Squidward	More like a lamatourium. Ha.
Squidward	Could we just get started already? I'm late for my coma.
Squidward	I've got a great idea. Why don't we just start rolling and you can explain the game as we play.
Squidward	Oh, good thing you've landed on snacks. You must be famished.
Squidward	Fine. Someone say my name.
Squidward	Well, neither have you.
Squidward	Race the car.
Squidward	But I was on snacks!
Squidward	"But I didn't say ""outsidies"" I said..."
Squidward	Huh? Oh, you know what, you're right. That was a good play.
Squidward	Somebody say my name!
Squidward	We can always clean the... uh...
Squidward	Two more times.
Squidward	Are you questioning my orders?
Squidward	And try this!
Squidward	How could you?
Squidward	What have I done? I flushed SpongeBob down a toilet. Why that's despicable. Even for me.
Squidward	SpongeBob! Are you down here?
Squidward	Figures.
Squidward	There it is!
Squidward	Ahh! Ahh! My eyes!
Squidward	What the?
Squidward	What are you doing?!
Squidward	Don't bother me while I'm hysterical!
Squidward	Hey, everybody. The cook's back from the toilet.
Squidward	There's no senior discount!
Squidward	SHH! Some people are trying to enjoy le cinema.
Squidward	PLEASE SIT DOWN!
Squidward	Yes! Anything you meathead! Just go before you destroy the place!
Squidward	Oh my sea stars! Free ice cream!
Squidward	One free cone, please?
Squidward	I want my free...
Squidward	You ate it all! You animals! You didn't even leave me one drop?!  There's gotta be some left in here!
Squidward	Oh. That's...thank you. I think.
Squidward	What are you talking about, jellyfish for brains! We are a troupe.
Squidward	Will you stop yapping already.
Squidward	Whatever. []
Squidward	Two, as in Two SpongeBobs? Sure, this is all just a bad dream, right? I'm dreaming and you're in my dream!
Squidward	Isn't it obvious, you red faced tightwad? I'm dreaming! [] What's that under there?
Squidward	Hm? Huh, how strange. Usually I wake up each morning with a dark feeling of dread gnawing at my stomach. But today, I feel positively...happy!  Smilin' rainbows, smilin' sun, smilin' rocks, and vegetation! Look ma, I'm dancing, and hear my song! The world is lovely when nothing is wrong! Everything's smiling, yes even me! Is this what they call feeling happy?!
Squidward	What the -- why?
Squidward	Oh, listen you dumb--  Uh, you know, looks like you guys got Fishkinned, and well, there's nothing you can do about that!
Squidward	Well, a family has moved in there, with a lot of kids, and they don't like to be disturbed.
Squidward	No no no, uh, a band lives there now!
Squidward	Mmmm, nice! Ah, it's like a beautiful dream! So peaceful, no more aggravation!  What is that porous terror up to now? Oh no, he's expecting a big family that speaks German!  Uh, German hallo?
Squidward	Umm...Gerhard.
Squidward	Umm...kerglooginpfiefer mit schlusinberry klabber sauz.
Squidward	Oh, pfft, the electric clarinet.
Squidward	Hedvig?  Oh, oh yeah, that's me, Hedvig!
Squidward	Uh, groovy enough for ya, man?
Squidward	You idiots! It's not the Fishtraps' house, it's your house, and that is still Patrick's house! You just saw a commercial -- that's all!
Squidward	Yes! And I'm calling Nick Fishkins right now to come over and flip my house, so I can move away!
Squidward	And what did he say?
Squidward	What's he so happy about?  April 1st?  April Fools Day is SpongeBob's favorite holiday!  Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today. I caught something terrible.
Squidward	Tell me what?
Squidward	You do?
Squidward	That does it! SpongeBob and his stupid pranks! I'm going to show him what a real prank is all about!
Squidward	Wait, don't go!
Squidward	Where's SpongeBob?
Squidward	SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy.
Squidward	SpongeBob, I'm...  SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am...  ...sorry.  There you go.
Squidward	Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true.
Squidward	April Fools! You're right, April Fools! I just fooled you all!
Squidward	"""You will be rewarded for your particular talent."" Right."
Squidward	Hooray.
Squidward	Well, do I get re-hired for a new job at the museum too?
Squidward	Ow.
Squidward	I hate everyone.  Huh, much better.
Squidward	What are you doing with thisow!
Squidward	Uh,  I am Animatronic Squidward. I cannot answer questions.
Squidward	Yes?
Squidward	I don't know who this P-Star7 is, but he's brilliant!
Squidward	Or we could push him off a cliff.
Squidward	Oh, brother.  Please bring back P-Star7.
Squidward	Grr!! For the last time, we get it! Trucks have horns!
Squidward	Typical.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, we've got to stop for the night if you want SpongeBob and Patrick to live! I'm not saying that's what I want, I'm just telling you the facts.
Squidward	I'll lure him to sleep with a lovely lullaby.
Squidward	How delightful!
Squidward	I've got the best taste in town! Duh!
Squidward	It's alright now, everybody! Everything's under control now! And whatever!
Squidward	Uh, uh, don't be hasty! Remember, I'm... I'm still the captain! The Hatty Patty was my idea!
Squidward	Hello, Krusty Krab.
Squidward	What about me?
Squidward	It is baloney!
Squidward	Ha, ha! Tooth Fairy! What a couple of molar morons!
Squidward	Look at how betrayed Patrick feels! Oh, this was totally worth staying up all night.
Squidward	The sanctity of my bathroom. The only place in the world where I can...  let it all hang out.  Me...
Squidward	The Martians are coming! Run for your lives! You're next! YOU'RE NEXT!
Squidward	I hate SpongeBob and I hate Patrick...
Squidward	Will you two shut up about that stupid show?!
Squidward	Because these two costume creeps chased them out.
Squidward	You're a comic book geek!
Squidward	Oh, don't tell me. Doctor Negative?
Squidward	Being evil. Isn't that what you wanted? Aren't you scared? Boo-hoo?
Squidward	Bring it around somewhere!
Squidward	Exactly. It's my homage to you and your love for money.
Squidward	Hurry up, SpongeBob, I need two orders of Krabby Krust stat.
Squidward	Let me out! Let me out!
Squidward	SpongeBob! I need a hug!
Squidward	Hey! Will you two psychopaths keep it down?!
Squidward	You know, normally, I jump up and scream when you appear like that. But I'm so tired, I'm just gonna take your stupid advice.
Squidward	Whatwhat's going on here? Where am I? I'm at the audition. I'm playing, but I'm not in control. II feel like I've been taken over by something.
Squidward	Get out of my body! Justjustjust get out!
Squidward	I envy you common people. For you are about to have the glorious honor of hearing me play Gustav Mollusk's Symphony No. 5 in C Sharp Minor. For I am in complete control.
Squidward	They all seem so... full of germs!
Squidward	You're contaminating the food! Just pick one!
Squidward	Now, where are we going to get tuxedos from?
Squidward	Oh, there's no way those people are gonna think our junk food is high class.
Squidward	Here you go, princess.
Squidward	Oh, down here.
Squidward	What the?
Squidward	Admit it. Without SpongeBob, you'd be nothing!
Squidward	These are being sent back!
Squidward	Hey, everybody! Look who's back in the kitchen!
Squidward	Everybody's a comedian. This is Squidward Tentacles, and I'd like to lodge a complaint about my neighbor SpongeBob.
Squidward	I hate SpongeBob! I hate Krabs! I wish they would leave the ocean in taxi cabs! And all the customers can kiss my abs! 'Cause I'm the one and only
Squidward	Just what are you two ignorami doing out here?
Squidward	Stop, stop, stop! I thought you said you were trying to hurt each other!
Squidward	Hi-ya! Hi-ya!
Squidward	I was trying to say that you got to fall from something higher.
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Better take two? Life insurance?  You giblet heads! No piece of paper can protect a person from getting hurt!
Squidward	Look, I'll prove it. You stand here.
Squidward	What does it look like? I'm running into a...  wall!
Squidward	Pfft. Big tough guy.
Squidward	Told ya! Here, let me help you.
Squidward	As a matter of fact, do you know what I'm gonna do now? I'm gonna run your super dangerous obstacle course. You know why?
Squidward	Will you stop shaking it?
Squidward	Ha, how 'bout that?
Squidward	Yes. Mmm. Right. Mmm.
Squidward	Oh, right. Like I would spend a moment of my time blowing bubbles.
Squidward	Hmm, business is booming.  How did I ever get surrounded by such loser neighbors? Uh huh.
Squidward	That's not art. That's just annoying. Blowing bubbles, that's the lamest idea I have ever heard.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.  Bubbles.  Art.
Squidward	Technique? Technique!? Technique, technique, technique, technique, technique!  First I do this, spin around. Stop. Double take three times. And here we go, pelvic thrust. Wehooooo! Wehoohoo! Oh, stop on your right foot, don't forget it. Then, bring it around town. And a little of this, a little of that, a little of this, this, this, this, that, that, that, that. And that, that, that that that that! And then...
Squidward	Technique? Hah! SpongeBob, you don't think I created that  beautiful work of art with your help?  Come on, it's in my genes.
Squidward	...genius.
Squidward	I'd love to hear one of your riveting sea tales, but I have to do my waste basket inspection.  Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. There's one.
Squidward	He took a break.
Squidward	Oh, I think he'll remember this for a long time. I know I will.
Squidward	Happy birthday to Cancer, sign of the crab. Not all Cancerius are crabby but they are all good at causing problems and blaming them on others. Many famous fibbers and elected officials are Cancers. My prediction for Cancer: This week you will fall asleep seven times. Don't worry you'll wake up.  I'm your Nicktoon Astrologer, Squidward, reminding you that it's bad karma to eat animated seafood.
Squidward	Say hello to Pisces, sign of the fish. If you a Pisces, people don't trust you. That's because Pisceans tend to lie, all the time. Even when they think they're telling the truth, they're not. For the Pisces who wants to stop lying, I have simple advice: never talk again. My prediction for Pisces in the year ahead: your nose will keep working just fine. I'm your Nicktoon astrologer Squidward, reminding you that psychic will tell you good things, if you tip them well.
Squidward	Feh!
Squidward	Alright, SpongeBob, hand it over. Well?
Squidward	Uh, SpongeBob? I'm over here! Now move!
Squidward	Sponge...
Squidward	Oh, what a beautiful day. And here I am trapped in a prison of high cholesterol.  No one ever comes in on Sunday.  Why can't Mr. Krabs just let us go home?  SpongeBob, stop ringing this bell!
Squidward	You can count on me, sir!  Take care, Hurry back. Get well soon. You're in our thoughts.  Takes more muscles to frown than to smile.  Okay, SpongeBob, let's get down to business. My first official act as new manager is to give  a promotion.
Squidward	Me, too.
Squidward	You push the button and put the money inside. Okay, you're on your own.
Squidward	No, I am not. I just remembered I needed change for this dollar.
Squidward	Oh, what  I doing?  I am wasting valuable relaxing time, that's what I'm doing! I mean, really. What are the odds? SpongeBob setting the Krusty Krab on fire.
Squidward	I don't like your tone.
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	Okay,  maybe you haven't messed up yet, but you will.  will...  And when you do, I'll be there. I'll be there!
Squidward	The truth will be revealed!
Squidward	Can we please stop this?
Squidward	You wished for gum?
Squidward	That's not what I meant!
Squidward	Mm-mm!
Squidward	Go away.
Squidward	What the...!?
Squidward	How disappointing.
Squidward	So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions.
Squidward	Fish paste.
Squidward	Rage. Fury. Irritation. Humiliation.
Squidward	That's it! I quit!
Squidward	Wha?
Squidward	Could this day get any worse?  Wha...? Of course it can.
Squidward	I'm gonna be stuck here forever.
Squidward	HA! Hahaha...  AH!
Squidward	No.
Squidward	How am I supposed to enjoy your day off if you come to work anyway?
Squidward	Why would I do that?
Squidward	May I take your order?
Squidward	Mr. Krabs!
Squidward	We? How about you take these patties and sho...
Squidward	Oh, you're right, Mr. Krabs. I learned my lesson. And by the way, Bubble Buddy picked up the tab.
Squidward	Wait! Don't waste this senseless violence on him! It's that stupid bubble of SpongeBob's that's causing all the problems!  Who's with me?
Squidward	He's... alive?
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change. But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards...  ...that guy.
Squidward	Now may I resume to my minimum-wage duties?
Squidward	Why can't I just buy something for the little weirdo?
Squidward	So, what flavor is it?
Squidward	And that's what happened.
Squidward	No, no! What we got... we got to call the hospital!
Squidward	You're right, Mr. Krabs!  I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had. And this time, there's going to be love... so much, he's going to drown in it.  Drown in it!
Squidward	Please, don't do that.
Squidward	Everything's in red.
Squidward	Hey, Frank.  Glad that's over.
Squidward	Who's there?
Squidward	Are you sure you should be poking it like that?
Squidward	C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset.
Squidward	Explosions... I mean, erosion.
Squidward	Why are you still here?
Squidward	That's not what I meant, you barnacle head!
Squidward	The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th...
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	You're not Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	"Say ""money."""
Squidward	I should have known.  Well, that's it. I'm getting off the Looney Express.
Squidward	Monster.
Squidward	La da dee, la da doo, la da dum, La da dee, la da doo, la da dum.
Squidward	Whatever it is, can't it wait until we get to work?
Squidward	Yawn.
Squidward	Pass.
Squidward	Down here.
Squidward	No. You may have hoodwinked everyone else in this backwater town, but you can't fool me. I listen to public radio.
Squidward	What's going on here?
Squidward	Mr. Krabs!  SpongeBob, zip it!
Squidward	Huh, what?
Squidward	I prefer suede.
Squidward	Squidasaurus Rex!
Squidward	How do you expect us to go up to the surface? We won't be able to breathe!
Squidward	What  it about then?
Squidward	There's no way I'm climbing into some dolphin's mouth.
Squidward	Ugh! This place smells awful!
Squidward	[annoyed by their laughing] Ugh! When is the sugar gonna wear off?
Squidward	What do you mean rewrote the story?
Squidward	Rock-hard abs!  Aw, SpongeBob, you're okay in my book.
Squidward	Mmm, mmm! Good, sir!
Squidward	Be quiet, SpongeBob!
Squidward	Cheer up, SpongeBob. I know someone who still likes you.
Squidward	I told you.
Squidward	What is going on out here?
Squidward	Chafed.  Alright, that's...!
Squidward	Four-way!
Squidward	I'm here about the happiness. I'll be moving in now.
Squidward	No, no starfish. Just a regular, normal, peace-loving-  Heaven at last.
Squidward	Good night, Clary. Tomorrow, we begin life anew.
Squidward	"Looks like when it comes to having fun, you don't have a ""leg"" to stand on!"
Squidward	Tag! You're it!
Squidward	Grievances! This town is a grievance! There should be a law against so many stuck-up tightwads living in one place! This city needs to be destroyed! or at least painted a different color.
Squidward	He's not in my thoughts.
Squidward	Yawn.
Squidward	Ooh.
Squidward	My wish is that the people of Bikini Bottom will stop paying any attention to the inane dribble that is constantly streaming out of this dunderhead's mouth.
Squidward	What? Who, me? Would you look at the time, I should go!
Squidward	SpongeBob, what are you doing?
Squidward	I'm not writing a letter to a figment of your imagination.
Squidward	Santa Claus is a big phony! SpongeBob has got you all fooled.
Squidward	Aww, our first Christmas. This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas. The first Christmas is this Christmas.  Cause it feels like the first Christmas to me.
Squidward	SpongeBob? He made me a present? It's probably a jellyfish net, or an old Krabby patty, or...  his favorite underpants. Haha.  Why, it looks like a clarinet.  It smells like one, too. Handcrafted on driftwood. And it's even got my name on it.  What's this?  Wow. This is the greatest gift I've ever gotten. Oh, I feel like a... I feel like a... I feel like a...  big jerk. What have I done to poor SpongeBob? Uh, hey, SpongeBob? I... SpongeBob?
Squidward	Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!
Squidward	Hey, uh, kid, take it easy.
Squidward	Well, that, um, is a result of, uh, undersea pressure on my body.
Squidward	I didn't bring Christmas to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob; you did.
Squidward	Uhh, right, just a second.  C'mon, let's see. What do little girls like? A box of matches? Or a shaving kit? A copy of my birth certificate? There's got to be something around here. Think. Think. Think. Ha! Perfect!  There you go, little girl! Ho, ho, ho!
Squidward	Here you go, Patrick.
Squidward	Yup, I'm insane.
Squidward	Really? Jellyfishing with you guys? Oh, that would be the best day ever in my book! I would love to go jellyfishing! I can't think of anything I'd like to do more on my day off than go jellyfishing with my two best friends: SpongeBob and... uh...
Squidward	Jellyfishing.  Oh, I'll go.  I sure had them going.  Stupid jellyfish! Beat it!
Squidward	And drowning, don't forget drowning!
Squidward	How long can she stay like that?
Squidward	Well, I'll do it. But I won't like it.  ...What?
Squidward	Oh... that overgrown clam is giving me a headache! I can't even take my afternoon beauty nap!
Squidward	You mean you don't know who did it?
Squidward	Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
Squidward	All right, who owns this crate?  Come on out! I wanna file a complaint!
Squidward	Ow.
Squidward	Will we be getting business cards?
Squidward	Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
Squidward	That's right! And you know what I wish?
Squidward	I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
Squidward	Please tell me this isn't a joke.
Squidward	What do you want? Hello, what's this? Someone left me money for a perm. Come to Hairy!  Ow! SpongeBob! Oh, my hair!  SpongeBob!
Squidward	One Krabby Patty for table two. SpongeBob, I don't have the whole day.
Squidward	You're killing me SpongeBob! Ha ha ha... you really are. .
Squidward	SpongeBob! What are you doing? I'm talking to you! SpongeBob! SpongeBob, are you mad?
Squidward	Squilliam Fancyson from band class?!
Squidward	Ohh, uhh, I... I, uhh...
Squidward	Stupid music rental clerk made me late. That trilobite didn't know an oboe from an elbow. Elbow, heh, more band humor.
Squidward	No, Patrick, mayonnaise is not an instrument.  Horseradish is not an instrument, either.  That's fine. No one has any experience. Fortunately, I have enough talent for all of you.
Squidward	Okay, that's perfect everybody. Bubble Bowl here we come. Flag twirlers, really spin those things. Okay, turn. Flag twirlers, let's go. I wanna see some spinning. Flag twirlers let's move! C'mon, move!
Squidward	So, if we play loud, people might think we're good. Everybody ready? And a one, and a two, and a one, two, three, four!  OK, new theory. Maybe we should play so quietly, no one can hear us.
Squidward	I knew this was gonna happen. They're just gonna have to find another band to play. I just hope that...  ...Squilliam doesn't find out! Squilliam!  What are you doing here?!
Squidward	That's his... eager face.
Squidward	Now! 8:00! So long, suckers! I've got a hot date with a little lady, and her name is:  Clarinet.  What?
Squidward	What!?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Will you please?! Here,  give me a moment's peace and take out the trash!
Squidward	So you're not afraid?
Squidward	No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you.
Squidward	Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha  because that's all they have time to say before he gets them!
Squidward	No!
Squidward	So it didn't grow back!
Squidward	Then he'll be coming.
Squidward	He opens the door  He slowly approaches the counter  ...and you know what he does next?
Squidward	He gets ya!  SpongeBob...  SpongeBob I wa...  I was ju...  I was jus...  SpongeBob, I was joking!
Squidward	Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?
Squidward	I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day!  What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?
Squidward	They don't!
Squidward	SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One - I hate you. And two - how can that be me when I'm standing right here!?
Squidward	Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights?
Squidward	"Excuse me. Does this lovely couple belong to you? They've been standing outside my house saying ""Where's Patrick?"" all day! It's driving me nuts!"
Squidward	Er...he said...um, well he said...
Squidward	Uncultured trash urchin. 9am. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer.  Welcome to art class!
Squidward	Yeah. Grab a little piece of Heaven and let's get with it.
Squidward	Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
Squidward	What the? How the? A perfect circle? Do it again. Show your process.
Squidward	Do you want to learn art, or not?
Squidward	Sorry, class dismissed. You're too late.
Squidward	"Your search is over. I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste. I call this one: ""Squidward en repose""."
Squidward	Wait, wait. That's not uh, uh...
Squidward	Anything?  It's me. It's me. I'm responsible.
Squidward	Yeah, no socks. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye. I gotta find SpongeBob!!  SpongeBob...SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
Squidward	Really!
Squidward	Let's go.
Squidward	Huh? But, but, what about the head...and the erasing, and the, the...
Squidward	OK, SpongeBob. Let's just move onto the marble.
Squidward	Well, uh, ok.
Squidward	Oh, boy.
Squidward	What?
Squidward	What is this!?!  You're making me pay you to stand at the cash register? What is the meaning of this? Have you gone off the deep end?
Squidward	In fact, you and I should go on strike!
Squidward	And while you work here, you expect to be treated fairly, right?
Squidward	News flash, SpongeBob! I got fired, too!  This is exactly why we need to go on strike.  He can't treat us like this anymore!
Squidward	Ahem.
Squidward	That's the idea. Now, throw it on the ground.
Squidward	Not a picket fence, you ding-dong. Picket sign!
Squidward	Attention, SpongeBob!   You just let your replacement cross our picket line without so much as a single threat.
Squidward	We will dismantle oppression board by board!  even if it takes
Squidward	Dismantle your oppressive establishment?
Squidward	You'll give us anything we want?
Squidward	S-Sp-SpongeBob! W-W-What have you done?
Squidward	Yup! You're a real lifesaver, friend!
Squidward	Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor.
Squidward	No, no, no, get away from me!
Squidward	N-no, no, no, I didn't mean that, no-no.
Squidward	Yech! That was disgusting! I feel like I need to scrub myself.
Squidward	Oh, this is nuts! I need a plan to get those two back together and out of my hair!
Squidward	Well, how about some soda, guys?
Squidward	Great, now go be friends somewhere else.
Squidward	That idea may just be crazy enough... to get us all killed!
Squidward	You can't do this to me, Mr. Plankton! If you think I'm going to stand out there all day listening to...
Squidward	There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go.
Squidward	Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron?  Moron...  as a requirement.
Squidward	Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!
Squidward	Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!
Squidward	What's that?
Squidward	I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!
Squidward	Everything sure looks delicious.  Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite!  Uh, hey, uh,  SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um...
Squidward	Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail.
Squidward	Could I have anything to eat?
Squidward	Can I have something to eat?
Squidward	Can I have something to eat?
Squidward	All hail the magic conch!
Squidward	What the...?
Squidward	No I didn't, sorry.  SpongeBob, could you just get my order?
Squidward	What's that?
Squidward	Take it easy, the food's no good here, anyway.
Squidward	What? Would you get out of here?
Squidward	Barnaclehead.
Squidward	Good what?
Squidward	That's me. Never had one, never will.
Squidward	I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty!
Squidward	No.
Squidward	SpongeBob, if I were trapped at the bottom of a well, for three years, with nothing to eat but that Krabby Patty, I'd eat my own legs first...  and not just the extra ones.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	If I didn't want it out there, what makes you think I'd find it more appealing in here?!
Squidward	!
Squidward	And I curse this Krabby Patty, and all who enjoy them, to an early and well-deserved !  Get it?
Squidward	Good! Now go spread the word!
Squidward	I need a Triple Krabby Supreme on a kelp bun,  with with extra sea pickles and, and burn it to a crisp, okay?
Squidward	What do I have to do? Eat one out of the garbage?
Squidward	Holy shrimp! I don't know where to start.  All that matters is that it's just you... and me... and nobody...
Squidward	Oh, I thought that...
Squidward	Yes! Yes! I admit it, SpongeBob! I  Krabby Patties!
Squidward	I didn't realize it was Happy Hopping Moron Day.
Squidward	Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider.  Let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box?
Squidward	Patrick, you're already a starfish.
Squidward	I hope they put some air holes in that box.
Squidward	Will you two shut up?!  Sponge... Bob?
Squidward	Forget it.  I don't know why I'm wasting my time out here when I could be watching my brand new television.
Squidward	Are you trying to say that I have no imagination? I have more imagination...  ...in one tentacle than you two have in your whole bodies.
Squidward	I got to try to relax. Perhaps I can drown out their childish games with a little TV.
Squidward	How are they doing that? That was the most realistic space launch I ever heard! There must be an explanation. Think, Squidward, think!
Squidward	"Don't ""We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!"" me!"
Squidward	All right, fine!  Take me to Robot Pirate Island! I wanna arm-wrestle with cowboys on the moon! Just do it so I can get back and watch TV!
Squidward	Vroom! Vroom! Only two more laps to the finish line!  I'm in the lead! Out of my way! I'm almost there!  Whoo-hoo-hoo! Victory is mine!
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Here's your shake, sir.  Grr.
Squidward	No, really?
Squidward	Wow! I can't believe he'd lend it to you!
Squidward	Oh. I'm telling.
Squidward	I'm getting closer to the phone!
Squidward	What did you do to me?
Squidward	Do you hear me?!  Holy fish paste! Get it off me! Get it off me!  Don't you know how to work that thing?
Squidward	I wonder if a fall from this height could be enough to kill me.
Squidward	Now I have to drive five miles to go to the bathroom....in my own home!
Squidward	Ready to move?
Squidward	Yes? Oh, Patrick.  What an unpleasant surprise. Oh, boy, nothing like a game of charades.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Okay, make it quick.
Squidward	No, SpongeBob, I'm not on your side either. I'm on nobody's side. Snowball fights are for immature children and I will not stoop to your level.  If you two want to knock each other's brains out with snowballs, kindly leave me out of it.
Squidward	No, no, no, I misled you, it's for adults too! Give me that peace treaty!  There! Let the war continue!
Squidward	No! Wait, why?
Squidward	Oh, boy. All right, I can see where this is going. Let's just say for all intents and purposes that I, Squidward, am now part in this war. Now...
Squidward	It's okay, Patrick. It's just a demonstration. Now...
Squidward	Would you two please...  ...stop throwing...  ...snowballs?!
Squidward	What's going on? The snowballs have stopped falling. I better take advantage of this momentary cease-fire.  What? My left flank is exposed? That bloated starfish is gonna run right through me!  I'll just fix that right now.  Wait, that makes my north wall a weak spot! Here we go! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Oh, oh, oh! But if they attack from the rear, I'm a goner!  There... Ha-ha!  But what about the possibility of an aerial attack!  I guess that ought to do it!  Fort Squidward is now all but impenetrable!  Now, where are those fools?  Ha! The first shot has been fired!  Take this, Patrick!  Taste my frozen fury!  Victory is mine!  Whee! Ha-ha! Well, I got you now!
Squidward	We're making the commercial, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, everyone needs an understudy.
Squidward	But, but, but, but, but, but, but...
Squidward	There you are, SpongeBob. I need you to...
Squidward	I think so, too, or Krabs will fire both of us.  On second thought, keep 'em waiting.
Squidward	Then why don't you back in the kitchen and grab some patties and give them what they came here for!
Squidward	But that's not fair!
Squidward	Well, I've never seen it.
Squidward	Are you accusing me of something?
Squidward	Here! Here! Here! See 'em?!
Squidward	Mistake? Ha! The only mistake I ever made was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab!
Squidward	Can I have one--?
Squidward	Uh, I , uh...
Squidward	Uh...no--where.
Squidward	Don't you get it?  I'm a lose-e-er! I lost my job, my home, everything!
Squidward	And in bed, too? Aw, thanks SpongeBob. SpongeBob, I...
Squidward	SpongeBob, can I get a glass of water?  Thank you.
Squidward	SpongeBob, where's my lemonade?
Squidward	Are you blind? Just look at it.
Squidward	Then go fix them.
Squidward	Get that away from me! You know I'm allergic to newsprint!
Squidward	What are you saying?
Squidward	What the...? What are you saying?
Squidward	Oh, shrimp! It's my arch rival from high school, Squilliam Fancyson! I can't let him see me in my Krusty Krab uniform.
Squidward	Don't be intimidated, Squidward. Try to imagine him in his underwear.  Oh, no, he's hot!  I'm, uhh, in... food service.
Squidward	T-t-t-t-t-t-tonight?
Squidward	Mr. Krabs! Please let me run the restaurant for just one night! I really need to impress Squilliam.
Squidward	The Corps? What the... Patrick, this isn't the... oh!  Beggars can't be choosers. Can you take hats in a dignified and sophisticated manner?
Squidward	I can't believe I'm saying this, but SpongeBob, you're going to have to be the waiter.
Squidward	Alright, I've got all the positions filled. I just might pull this off!
Squidward	But I thought you said you were the head chef on the S.S. Gourmet?
Squidward	SpongeBob, hold on! Let's just take a second here to relax.  Little more.  Little more.  Good. Now, I want you to empty your mind.
Squidward	How do you feel?  SpongeBob?  This isn't working! I gotta go tell Squilliam I need more time!  I'll just go to Squilliam's house and...  Squilliam, you're here!
Squidward	But what about Krabs and Patrick?
Squidward	It worked. I can't believe it! Squilliam thinks I own a five-star restaurant. Time to rub it in his face.  Well, Squilliam, I'm waiting.
Squidward	I'm sorry, one more time.
Squidward	No! Nooo!
Squidward	Oh, the usual.  Would you get out of here!?
Squidward	Hilarious. Just deliver the food.
Squidward	Umm... yeah, sure.
Squidward	There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you...
Squidward	Will you be quiet? Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like?
Squidward	Not the Navy!  Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world!  Our world!  What do we do now?
Squidward	They poop on the robot?
Squidward	"I said ""shut up!"", you bucket of bolts!"
Squidward	And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know.
Squidward	We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs?
Squidward	He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way.
Squidward	"We're just gonna see what your ""little buddy"" knows."
Squidward	I thought you said robots can't cry.
Squidward	Actually, I can't share the recipe with you. It's a secret.
Squidward	Well, if I did run a restaurant, my exquisite taste and gourmet know-how would have customers waiting in line for years just to get a table!
Squidward	Oh, I don't know about that.
Squidward	I don't see any use for all these old flap traps. We should just break them down for parts.
Squidward	I'm making chum fricassee.
Squidward	Oh, just taste it already!
Squidward	Ah. You may speak.
Squidward	"Oh, ""The Fisherman."" ""The Fisherman."" Blah, blah, blah. They wanta Fisherman, eh? I'll give thema Fisherman! And how!  No.  No.  Um... no.  Aha!  It's time for those lame-brains to meet the  Fisherman.  This is gonna be good."
Squidward	Huh?
