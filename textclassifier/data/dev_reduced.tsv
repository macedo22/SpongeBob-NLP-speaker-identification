Gary	Meow.
Mr. Krabs	Well lad, well give you a test, and if you pass, you'll be on the Krusty Krew! Go out and fetch me...  a, uh, hydrodynamic spatula...  with, um, port-and-starboard-attachments,  and, uh... turbo drive!  And don't come back till you get one!
Mr. Krabs	Anchovies!
Mr. Krabs	MAN OVERBOARD! Climb, Mr. Squidward! Climb!
Mr. Krabs	Three cheers for SpongeBob! Hip-hip!
Mr. Krabs	I'll be in my quarters, counting up the booty.
Mr. Krabs	don't deliver, but  do.
Mr. Krabs	Sorry, can't hear you!
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Good one, Patrick!
Mr. Krabs	The boys eyes are bigger than his stomach.
Mr. Krabs	Yippee!  Whoo-ha! Whoo-ha!
Mr. Krabs	Nothing! Now get out!
Mr. Krabs	No.
Mr. Krabs	Aww, come on now, Squidward. Three fellas at sea with nothing to do but throw their lines in the water, catch a few clams  then throw them back. Don't you think that's fun?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, Squidward, you're never gonna believe it! A giant blue-lipped clam ate me millionth dollar!  I lost me dollar! And I'll never get it back!  Never, never, never, never, never...
Mr. Krabs	Could it be?  Me millionth dollar?  Whoo-hoo!  Wait a minute...  This isn't me millionth dollar.  This is an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon, and kissed with Coral Blue #2 Semi-Gloss Lipstick.
Mr. Krabs	No, it's this sandwich.
Mr. Krabs	"So, you thought you'd skip out on old Krabs, did ya? Even after you promised to help me. I know what you're thinking. ""It's just a dumb old dollar. Let's just leave the old man. He won't notice.""  Well, it's not going down like that. There's only one use for a backstabbing crew like you:  live bait."
Mr. Krabs	Hello, boys!
Mr. Krabs	Nothing important.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, barnacles! I hate the pill.  Pearl, do you think I'm... old?
Mr. Krabs	Well, what if I said it with a different inflection? Co-.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, get away from me. I don't need no snot-nosed little...  Sorry you had to see that.
Mr. Krabs	Well, little patty, we're two of a kind. We've both lost our luster.  Hmmm, so that's what I taste like.
Mr. Krabs	I couldn't help overhearing your big plans. And I was wondering if you had room for one more craaaaazy dude tonight, huh?
Mr. Krabs	Uhh... how do you do?
Mr. Krabs	I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	It's more like a chick repellent. And there's only two seats.
Mr. Krabs	They sure are giving these clubs some crazy names! I have to tell you boys... I'm a little nervous. I haven't been, you know, on the scene for quite a while now.
Mr. Krabs	You know, I love staring at delicates as much as the next guy, but it's just that I thought we'd see more of the nightlife. Something that'll give you that wild and crazy hot-blooded feeling, if you know what I mean.
Mr. Krabs	I'm feeling a warm spot.
Mr. Krabs	Because I can feel it. You wanna know what I'm feelin'?
Mr. Krabs	I may be old, but even an old bag of shells like me knows that you haven't suggested one cool thing all night! So good night to you!
Mr. Krabs	And you're talking about raiding their dressers for their underpants, right?
Mr. Krabs	Frilly things! We hit the jackpot!
Mr. Krabs	Well, I, uhh, uhh, heh, hehe...  Why didn't you tell me this was my mother's house?!
Mr. Krabs	That's all right, lad. I certainly feel younger.
Mr. Krabs	What happened?  Someone tried to throw away a patty!
Mr. Krabs	I don't understand. We haven't had a customer in weeks. I wonder if it's the new placemats.
Mr. Krabs	Make sure you wrap up that Patty. I'm not finished with it yet!
Mr. Krabs	That's not a good sign.
Mr. Krabs	What do you want from me?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman, I don't want to go in there! I'll do anything! Please, give me another chance!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, boys!
Mr. Krabs	No, silly! It means free toy!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! How's the break coming?
Mr. Krabs	Thanks, Squidward. You look rested.
Mr. Krabs	Sure. I'm still in the hospital sleeping like a baby!
Mr. Krabs	Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off.
Mr. Krabs	That depends, how much money we talking about?
Mr. Krabs	You think I could've gotten more?
Mr. Krabs	Heh, about trading you for pocket change...
Mr. Krabs	Whee-hoo!
Mr. Krabs	You see, boy, during the summer, the children are excused from their classes, a recess commonly referred to as summer break.
Mr. Krabs	Playground? Luring away me young customers. Warm up the boat, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!  You're just in time for the grand unveiling of Krabby Land!
Mr. Krabs	Mmm... a-ha!  Okay, money. I mean, err... children. It's time for the grand unveiling of... money! I mean, Krabby Land!  Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs	Have fun and don't forget to eat plenty of vitamin-enriched Krabby Patties.  Krabby the Clown's favorite meal.
Mr. Krabs	Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Get out there and tell 'em!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, I ain't cheap!  Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils.
Mr. Krabs	Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff!  No! Not that green stuff!  Noooooooooo!
Mr. Krabs	Okay, boy, your turn.
Mr. Krabs	Today is the 25th anniversary of the first time me arch-enemy Plankton ever tried to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.
Mr. Krabs	Uh-uh.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob. Why don't you go hose out the men's room?
Mr. Krabs	Uh, sure.  Here you go.
Mr. Krabs	Or what?
Mr. Krabs	Well, Mr. Squidward, it's almost closing time, and we haven't seen eye or antennae of ol' Plankton for hours. Yes, sir, I think this time, he's finally given up for...
Mr. Krabs	You planted grass?
Mr. Krabs	Curse you Plankton, and your ability to join together to form a working human ear!
Mr. Krabs	Eye.
Mr. Krabs	Don't do it!
Mr. Krabs	Get out of here!
Mr. Krabs	I wasn't five-time 'Golden Claws' in the navy for nothin'! When he sees me moves, he'll be running scared. So, where is this little bully? Down at the park? The sodey shop? What does he look like, eh, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Wha?
Mr. Krabs	Ooh!
Mr. Krabs	Please, spirits, leave me be.
Mr. Krabs	No! Don't burn me dollar!  Well, well, well, if it isn't SpongeBob and Patrick.
Mr. Krabs	Of course it does. Well, you two better hurry home before someone sees ya nude.
Mr. Krabs	The Krusty Krab presents... live nude pranksters!  Starring the Bikini Bottom Ghosts!
Mr. Krabs	Well, he's wrong!
Mr. Krabs	Day 10 of non-stop service!
Mr. Krabs	You could learn a few things from that boy.
Mr. Krabs	Krusty Krab! The restaurant that never closes. Would you like to place an order?  10,000 Krabby Patties! We'll start your order right away, Mr...uh, uh...What was that name again?  Uh huh...Peter Lankton. Wait a minute; this isn't some kind of prank, is it?
Mr. Krabs	That's me boy! Now, make me 10,000 Krabby Patties.  And no breaks!
Mr. Krabs	Day 30!
Mr. Krabs	What the flimflam?  What are you doing in here, boy? You're wasting all me food.  Boy?
Mr. Krabs	All right. Now you're just acting silly. I want you to...
Mr. Krabs	and here are some fresh Krabby...
Mr. Krabs	Good to see you're brain's all fixed, boy.
Mr. Krabs	Come out here, boy.
Mr. Krabs	A treasure trove of sorts. It's me memory chest from my years in the navy.
Mr. Krabs	And this is me 'Manly Toughness Trophy'.
Mr. Krabs	"Of course! I was called ""Armor Abs Krabs""."
Mr. Krabs	Not in the stomach! In me armor abs!
Mr. Krabs	Don't look at me! Leave me be!
Mr. Krabs	'Armor Abs Krabs' can't show up at the reunion like this. All pink and soft and unmanly. I'm all flab and no ab!
Mr. Krabs	I can't go anywhere ever again. Stupid, no good...
Mr. Krabs	Course, you'll need some time to approximate me personality.
Mr. Krabs	That's me.
Mr. Krabs	No you're not. Don't blow this for me, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	I don't believe it. SpongeBob is pulling it off.
Mr. Krabs	This is the best night of my life. Me naval buddies still think I'm manly. And I didn't have to shed myself.
Mr. Krabs	I'm doomed.
Mr. Krabs	I can't watch.
Mr. Krabs	I don't understand.
Mr. Krabs	Just stand aside, lad, and let me unlock the door.
Mr. Krabs	No. I'm just doubled over in pain, fightin' back tears in me eyes because it's a new dance craze!
Mr. Krabs	Armageddon! What? Oh, you? What in the blue eye scallop are you doing in me bedroom?
Mr. Krabs	No!
Mr. Krabs	It's... me money!  Oh, money. I promise I'll never leave you alone again.
Mr. Krabs	Sue?!
Mr. Krabs	I'm in a blue ruin. I'm doomed!
Mr. Krabs	What is it, lad?
Mr. Krabs	Never, you little runt!
Mr. Krabs	I don't know where he could be.
Mr. Krabs	Is there a problem?
Mr. Krabs	"It's a ""wet floor"" sign."
Mr. Krabs	Ahh, Squidward, a loyal employee.
Mr. Krabs	I'm doomed.
Mr. Krabs	I'll take that!
Mr. Krabs	A present? For me?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, are you okay? You look kinda...different.
Mr. Krabs	What the...?
Mr. Krabs	That's enough, boy. See it's not always what you say that matters. Sometimes it's what you don't say. Understand?
Mr. Krabs	Wh...?
Mr. Krabs	That's it, set her down easy.
Mr. Krabs	C'mon, Squidward, you know you want to.
Mr. Krabs	At a quarter a pop, this thing pays for itself in no time.
Mr. Krabs	Need some more change?
Mr. Krabs	All out of? Hmmm.  Boys, it's payday.
Mr. Krabs	No, he doesn't. You don't listen to him, Squidward. You keep playing until you win!  What's this?
Mr. Krabs	I'll try to remember that.  3,498 of Squidward's quarters... 3,499 of Squidward's quarters.
Mr. Krabs	Thank you very much, madam.  I feel so alive! Cha ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaring. Money, oh money, how I love thee. Cha-ching. Cha-chong. Cha-changaroo. From pennies to dollars. Any amount will do. Cha-ching. Cha-ching. It's no contest. There's only one thing that I love the best from every sight I ever seen, to sweetest sound I've heard. I'd gladly give up everything for all the money that I've earned! Cha-ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaring. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed!
Mr. Krabs	Howard Blandy? You mean the Howard Blandy? The Howard Blandy that masterminded the ruthless takeover of every small family owned business in Bikini Bottom? That Howard Blandy?  I worship you.
Mr. Krabs	Jumpin' King Neptune!  Sold. Can I have my money?
Mr. Krabs	I'm retiring!
Mr. Krabs	Ahh, the sweet smell of a brand-new day. First stop: the new hook museum. And then maybe I'll...  Hey, the Krabby O' Mondays? Not the name I would've chosen. But that's all behind me now.  Wait a minute, I hate golf!  Well, I've done everything I wanted to do. And it's not even noon.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, really?
Mr. Krabs	Find some friends she says, find a hobby she says, get a job she says...  Help wanted.
Mr. Krabs	Ok, boy, back to work.
Mr. Krabs	Sure, Squidward. Ya know, I've never seen you this happy.
Mr. Krabs	What's this? Help me.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what happened to the Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs	That's because they don't know what they're eating.  Excuse me, ma'am, do you know what's in that patty you're eating?
Mr. Krabs	You better believe there's a problem! I used to kiss the ground you walked on, Blandy! But after seeing this, I wouldn't even spit in your direction! Krabby Patties are supposed to be made by hand, one at a time! Not on a conveyor belt!
Mr. Krabs	No, not really. Get back to work.
Mr. Krabs	You've come to the right place, son. Ya know, there's one thing that always makes me laugh.  Don't it just tickle you, boy?
Mr. Krabs	The doctor said it was the most tiny, dried-out, underused laugh box he ever laid eyes on.
Mr. Krabs	Mother! Uh, what brings ya by today?
Mr. Krabs	Ah! Quick, SpongeBob, swallow me wallet!
Mr. Krabs	Yes, Mommy.  Squidward, I need you to make a return for me.
Mr. Krabs	Plankton!
Mr. Krabs	This no-good conniving chiseler is your date?
Mr. Krabs	Mommy?  You!
Mr. Krabs	I'm talking about the Krabby Patty formula!
Mr. Krabs	Mommy, can't you see? He's trying to seduce the Krabby Patty formula right from under you.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, brother.
Mr. Krabs	What are ye lads doing?
Mr. Krabs	I wasn't talking about Pearl. I was talking about the Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs	Now, this is what I call a happy ending.
Mr. Krabs	How about a discount on restroom tokens?
Mr. Krabs	Get back to work, we got orders waitin'!
Mr. Krabs	Urrgh!
Mr. Krabs	Nonsense, you'll be back makin' Krabby Patties like your old self in no time!
Mr. Krabs	Take your time.
Mr. Krabs	It's time.
Mr. Krabs	Hip hip...
Mr. Krabs	What are you two doing laying around? Get to work.
Mr. Krabs	Time is money, boy.
Mr. Krabs	Good morning! The Krusty Towers is now opened for business!
Mr. Krabs	"My first hotel guest! Watch me reel him in.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers, where our motto is ""We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request""."
Mr. Krabs	Squidward,  can take Patrick's bags up to his room. SpongeBob, you go make the Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs	Hold on. Squidward! Patrick needs your help.
Mr. Krabs	Deny no guests!  Why, hello, Patrick. You need Squidward to come up right away? He'll be right there.
Mr. Krabs	What do you think you're doing?
Mr. Krabs	And why in tarnation would I do that? You got four legs that aren't broken.
Mr. Krabs	What?! You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to eat that!
Mr. Krabs	Here's your homemade cookies.
Mr. Krabs	Great! Now that me laundry's in the trunk...
Mr. Krabs	What?!
Mr. Krabs	The pool's out back!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start.
Mr. Krabs	Pack your bags, boys! You're going to medical school!
Mr. Krabs	It is?  Oh, I mean it is! Very special. Very very special, indeed.
Mr. Krabs	Well, we don't want that to happen.
Mr. Krabs	I promise.
Mr. Krabs	It's me credit card. You use it instead of money.
Mr. Krabs	I've had that since the day she was born. I got it on sale.
Mr. Krabs	You're a real fan, huh?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what took you so long? And where's Pearl's present?
Mr. Krabs	And frosting.
Mr. Krabs	I'll make it up to you somehow, Pearl.
Mr. Krabs	I ought to...
Mr. Krabs	HUH?! Monster Krabby Patty?!
Mr. Krabs	Whats all the lallygagging about?
Mr. Krabs	Le Spatula! What in blazes is that?
Mr. Krabs	What? Are you going against your commanding officer?
Mr. Krabs	What happened?
Mr. Krabs	Nothing. Oh well.  That sounds like a quarter crying for help.  Come to papa!
Mr. Krabs	And then what?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, Squidward, don't you believe in magic?
Mr. Krabs	Hold on there, SpongeBob. Let me show you your new station. It's kind of a promotion. Sorta.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what kind of haul did you get?
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, sure, whatever.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward? What were you doing down there? I didn't approve of the overtime. Or were you sneaking here in the dead of night for free wishes?
Mr. Krabs	Listen closely, SpongeBob. You don't get what you want in life just by wishing for it.  What in the deep blue is that?
Mr. Krabs	You'll never get me to believe in magic, never! Just to prove it to ya.  I'll demonstrate. I wish... I was steamed and served with a side of melted butter.
Mr. Krabs	What is this?  Ha-ha! Very funny, Plankton! But you're gonna have to do a lot better than taking a stab at my illiteracy to offend me.
Mr. Krabs	Actually, I don't recall you ever having a customer.
Mr. Krabs	All right, Plankton. But be aware, I'm not letting my guard down.
Mr. Krabs	Uh-huh. Clever, Plankton! Two can play at this game.
Mr. Krabs	It sure is, you little half-wit. And you know what else is good news? We can finally use that DJ system. Hit it, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	How do you like them apples, you little...
Mr. Krabs	Grr...
Mr. Krabs	A-ha, I knew it.  It was all a trick to get me to hand over... Wait, did you say no?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I get it. Stick to your guns, and eventually we'll all believe it. Soften us up and when our backs are turned, you'll make your move.  Oops.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, Plankton?
Mr. Krabs	Heh, good. Uh...I want to make it up to you. What do you say we grab a soda?
Mr. Krabs	Uh, I don't know about this, Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	No, no. I want you to have this. It's the secret formula.
Mr. Krabs	Sure is buddy. Sure is.
Mr. Krabs	But they just want to dine on some Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, it's you.
Mr. Krabs	All's well that ends well.
Mr. Krabs	Fine?!  Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine.
Mr. Krabs	He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy.
Mr. Krabs	That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement.
Mr. Krabs	Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job.
Mr. Krabs	Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker.
Mr. Krabs	We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?
Mr. Krabs	I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up.  Further.  Further.  Further.  Further.  That'll do.
Mr. Krabs	Uh-huh.
Mr. Krabs	Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it.  SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?
Mr. Krabs	Bumping barnacles, yes.  There she is.
Mr. Krabs	What in Davy Jones' locker is on your head, son?
Mr. Krabs	I can imagine.
Mr. Krabs	Hahahaha. You wouldn't know cool if I locked you in the freezer.
Mr. Krabs	No, SpongeBob, it means until you get rid of that wig, get your butt out of here.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! This is not the time for Sunday Stroll. It's time for work.
Mr. Krabs	We do? Great, she can start right away.
Mr. Krabs	Order up, Miss Patricia.
Mr. Krabs	Did I order two meals? Oh, silly me. I can't possibly eat two Krusty meals, myself.  I guess you'll just have to help me finish all this food.
Mr. Krabs	How about Sunday brunch?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru.
Mr. Krabs	What's this all ab...  Well, well, well. What can I do for you, Patrick?
Mr. Krabs	Listen, Patrick, there comes a time in every man's life when he's got to settle down. You know, get a wife, kids, a father-in-law you give all your money to.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! Where in the blue barnacles did you come from?
Mr. Krabs	Ravenous did you say? That's another word for hungry, isn't it?  Welcome Wild Ones! They'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor. With the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains. And to top it off, a custom chopper patty. And best of all, I'll raise me prices 150%. I'll make a fortune.
Mr. Krabs	You're not running off any of me paying customers. You can stay and get beat up in the parking lot if you wish.
Mr. Krabs	No, it's impossible. I must've counted me money a dozen times, and it still comes up short. Profits are down. Oh, I feel sorry for me self.
Mr. Krabs	KelpShake?
Mr. Krabs	I'm talking about this.
Mr. Krabs	Then you do understand.
Mr. Krabs	Don't try that with me, Plankton. This new store is ruining me business.
Mr. Krabs	Block after block.
Mr. Krabs	Here goes. Wa-choo!  I'm sorry, I have a bit of a  ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...choo!!
Mr. Krabs	[Sighs] If you want anything done right, you've got to do it yourself.  Oh, me back.
Mr. Krabs	Uh...we've gone into business together. You see, SpongeBob, we were hired, uh...to fix this door.
Mr. Krabs	What's that suppose to mean?
Mr. Krabs	I don't know about this, Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	Thanks.  I can't believe we did it.
Mr. Krabs	Nice try.
Mr. Krabs	Well, we gotta get more.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, wait a minute! Plankton!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, get back here you little booger!
Mr. Krabs	Hold on a second, there.
Mr. Krabs	Keep playing, lad! Take them devil sons of the sea away from me restaurant!
Mr. Krabs	You see, SpongeBob, it's not about you or your perfect day or any of those things.
Mr. Krabs	"So, just tell us anything your little heart desires, and it's yours.  Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the Bikini Bottom Players proudly present a very expensive production of... ""The Best Day Ever."" And it better be good for all it's costing me."
Mr. Krabs	Just till his little heart gives out, Squidward. Just till his little heart gives out.
Mr. Krabs	Me secret formula!
Mr. Krabs	Friends at birth, you might say. Even as wee ones.
Mr. Krabs	'Twas true. I did get me clothes from the trash.  You see, when I was growing up, times were tough. Me mother had to  fashion me clothes from rags.
Mr. Krabs	Buy things? So, I spent it on a gift for me best pal Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	Excuse us!
Mr. Krabs	So we went back to our secret hideaway, the dump, to prove to those chowder heads that a burger could be semi-edible and easy to swallow. We made sure to keep careful record of our progress.
Mr. Krabs	I thought it was our recipe.
Mr. Krabs	Burgers aren't for ruling worlds!
Mr. Krabs	Hold on there, me boy. We don't need to go through that again.
Mr. Krabs	Barnacles to the customers!  I'm talkin' about coins, cash, wallets, bank accounts! And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
Mr. Krabs	You said it, old chum.  Attention! Get your Plankton and Krabs patties right here!  Do you think it was a good idea to open in the dump?
Mr. Krabs	"""Plab Patties KO's Old Man J"". I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy."
Mr. Krabs	No way, that recipe's mine!
Mr. Krabs	What? Why I oughta squash you right now. You little...
Mr. Krabs	You callin' me a liar?
Mr. Krabs	I'd like that, Planky, old chum.
Mr. Krabs	You're doin' well, Jim. Is that limo solid gold?
Mr. Krabs	Hey, bigshot! Why don't you step behind the fryer for old time's sake?
Mr. Krabs	Now how's about that patty?
Mr. Krabs	Come here. Help us cheer for Jim.
Mr. Krabs	Well, I better go find him. SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	'Scuse me?
Mr. Krabs	Aye, it's still as funny today as it was then.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, she's a dump, alright. But she's my dump.
Mr. Krabs	Meandering mermaids! What's all this racket, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Then don't blink.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, boy! It'll keep your room lit, so you won't be scared stiff!
Mr. Krabs	Then would it be too much trouble to ask his high and mightiness to take these patties out to the customers? Oh If only SpongeBob were here
Mr. Krabs	It wasn't me! It was Squidward! He gave you all the Ick!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, hey, hey! There's no need to fight! Cause I have a solution I'll be happy with.  Step up to be de-Icked! Only 5 dollars!
Mr. Krabs	Another 5 dollars for another de-Icking.
Mr. Krabs	One of you will have to volunteer for some extra work.
Mr. Krabs	Your instructions are on this Krabby Patty. But remember, the fate of the Krusty Krab rests in your hands, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	Baby clothes? Hmm...  What's he doing now?
Mr. Krabs	Krabs to Agent SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	Exactly. So get to work.
Mr. Krabs	Bring it on, Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	...win!
Mr. Krabs	Tell it to the claw, sister. Last time he failed, we made a bet.  You can't beat me, Plankton. I always win!
Mr. Krabs	What's that, laddie?
Mr. Krabs	Uh, well, actually, I wasn't keeping score. But I'll just say that you and SpongeBob are neck and neck. That mystery guy over there will be the tie breaker.
Mr. Krabs	Enjoy your prize.
Mr. Krabs	Nope, just the brochure. Well, got to get back to counting me loot. Enjoy your new prize, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	A minute late?
Mr. Krabs	Be sure to close up when you're done.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob? What in Neptune's Navy is going on here?
Mr. Krabs	Hold on! This ain't no hotel, son.
Mr. Krabs	Okay. Then get cleaned up. You're a mess.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, you can't be hanging your delicates in me customer's faces.
Mr. Krabs	You can't stay in here. These are my private quarters, boy. The only play I can escape for solitude during the day.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, who put these fancy smelling soaps in the restroom?
Mr. Krabs	No, I...  What the...?
Mr. Krabs	Who touched me thermostat?!
Mr. Krabs	What?  Hey, you kids get off of my lawn!
Mr. Krabs	Morning, boys.  Lock's a bit sticky this morning.  Is it cold in here or is it just me? Well, get to work.
Mr. Krabs	I don't care if Santie Claus and Jack Frost are having ice cream cones. Don't... touch... the thermostat!
Mr. Krabs	It's beautiful. I'm selling twice as many patties and I don't even have to cook them. This is the happiest, and most cost-effective day of me whole life.
Mr. Krabs	You lose again, Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	Thank you, lad.  Well, well, if it isn't Plankton. You know, I should thank you. What with the ice rink and now the swimming pool gimmick, I'm making more money than I ever did with the old Krusty Krab. Hey, you got any more good ideas?
Mr. Krabs	And I bet you tried to steal this, too.
Mr. Krabs	And these metal decorations?
Mr. Krabs	But you're paying for enhanced ambiancedude.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what's with the fancy getup?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I can smell the money already.
Mr. Krabs	Sorry, boy. no can do.
Mr. Krabs	I think I can explain, boy. There was a time when I was in love too. She was a Krabby Patty that looked a lot like yours does.  Well, maybe not right now, but you know what I mean. She was a firm, juicy, a warm patty. And attractive- oh, she looked good enough to eat. So I did. do you hear what I'm saying to you, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Yar-har, Pearl's my daughter, I'll spit in your eye! Yo-ho, Pearl's a whale, and it's her birthday, yar-yar-yar! Ta-da!
Mr. Krabs	Pearl, these are the finest fishin' boots available!
Mr. Krabs	In the way? These boots never leave my sight! These are the most expensive and prized possessions I own.
Mr. Krabs	Sorry, son, these boots are far too valuable.
Mr. Krabs	You got a...
Mr. Krabs	Five, ten, twenty, thirty...  Wha? Who's there?  Back to countin' me money.  One, two, three, four, five...  What the barnacle is that?  Arrgh, that was the worst night I ever weathered. At least I'll have some peace and quiet at work.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-ob.
Mr. Krabs	I, uhh...
Mr. Krabs	What is it, my boy?
Mr. Krabs	Look, don't cry. I got some, uhh, some magic oven mitts!
Mr. Krabs	What'll ya have?
Mr. Krabs	What?
Mr. Krabs	Because, lad, you didn't need 'em. It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee. I mean, uh, the person... in the boots. You're a great fry cook.
Mr. Krabs	Darling, I won't.  Oh, no.
Mr. Krabs	Free?!  Mr. Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	They look okay to me.
Mr. Krabs	What's the meaning of this?
Mr. Krabs	I have one thing to say to you, mister. Oh, I just love the little ketchup dimples you do!  You're the new Employee of the Month.
Mr. Krabs	"You know what they say: ""Money Talks."""
Mr. Krabs	If I could talk to money, how great my life would be. We'd tell each other secrets, all their friends would visit me. I'd bathe in filthy riches, which is clean enough for me. Oh, if you could tell me what you want, how happy we would be. We'd surely be the best of friends, we'd never disagree. There wouldn't be a downside, not one that I could see. If I could talk to money, come along, sing with me.
Mr. Krabs	You?
Mr. Krabs	Hey, is that pixie dust?  Whew, that was a strange dream.
Mr. Krabs	Do you have anything to say to me?
Mr. Krabs	Good morning, my darlings.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, aren't they a riot?
Mr. Krabs	Nothing, nothing. You guys are great. I thought you guy might want some company, you know, to make you happy.
Mr. Krabs	What? No way.
Mr. Krabs	I can't spend all of you. And none of you want to be spent on stuff I want.
Mr. Krabs	I'm not...  SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Hehe, yeah, well, I sort of sold my soul already.
Mr. Krabs	What's is this contraption you've hauled into me place?
Mr. Krabs	Your machine sounds delightful. But how much does it cost?
Mr. Krabs	"No, Squidward. this is worse. he's got the thousand-yard stare. I had it once meself back in me service days.  What is it, lad? Quick, we're losing money!  It's the boy's tiny calendar. And he has circled today's date.  ""Important Food Critic visits Krusty Krab."""
Mr. Krabs	M Mr. Scallop, wait, please. Before you go, come on, sit down. Try one of our delicious Krabby Patties. It's absolutely  Complimentary.  Okay, SpongeBob, that'll be all.  He's nobody.  We're doomed!
Mr. Krabs	Ay, ay-ay-ay-ay... That's me boy, SpongeBob. That's me boy.
Mr. Krabs	Umm yeah, a little bit like that.
Mr. Krabs	Look at these, Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	"Condiments. We got ""Tangy Spongy Sauce"" and ""Mild Bobby Sauce"" for the not-so-daring."
Mr. Krabs	Are you kidding, lad? Just look at these paying customers!  Who's ready for another lap?  Keep on truckin' SpongeBob. I've got some important business to see to in me office.
Mr. Krabs	And let's watch the language, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Get back to work, SpongeBob. I'll be in me SpongeBob if you SpongeBob me.  Whoops!  There you go, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	They were just in the boxes of patties we didn't have room for in the freezer. They turned yellow. Got to keep those SpongeBob ice cubes somewhere, you know.
Mr. Krabs	Who?
Mr. Krabs	No! But... I just... just... I can explain, I...  What the...?
Mr. Krabs	Permission to approach the bench, your honor!
Mr. Krabs	Well, good night, folks. Come again.  Thought those deadbeats would never leave. Closin' time, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	That's right, a spot. You know the rule. Nobody leaves work till...
Mr. Krabs	Hmmm... strange vortex in the west. Well, it's probably got nothing to do with SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	Let's see what he's done this time.
Mr. Krabs	Hold it right there, Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	You think! SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Better be something other than bills this time.  Plankton!
Mr. Krabs	Eh? What was that, Sonny?
Mr. Krabs	You kids get off my lawn! I'll catch up with you, boy!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob? SpongeBob!  Wake up, boy! You're burning me money!
Mr. Krabs	This is the fourth time this week I've had to scrape you off of something.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, wait!  Oh, he'll be back, alright. He'll be back.
Mr. Krabs	All right you filthy bilge rats!
Mr. Krabs	We're getting a gourmet chef from the chef exchange program and I'm going to raise me prices to the roof!
Mr. Krabs	Well, he's just as affectionate as the boy.
Mr. Krabs	So it's supposed to smell like a rotten gym socks?
Mr. Krabs	I'm ruined! Busted!  Hello?
Mr. Krabs	No!  is more like it. They keep you, I keep my kneecaps.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I've been such a fool! I turned away SpongeBob, the best fry cook I ever had, and it cost me everything!
Mr. Krabs	Darn his cursed mocking voice! I...  SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Oh no way. See, I've learned that you can't buy customer loyalty with fancy tables, froufrou food, or even sanitary conditions. Hey get back you, eat your own.  Nope, just good food prepared with love. Ain't that right SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	"No, no, no. Today's Monday. Otherwise I wouldn't be wearing this ""I hate Mondays"" shirt."
Mr. Krabs	Diamond light bulbs! I wonder what they make the money out of.
Mr. Krabs	Nice hot rod flames!
Mr. Krabs	Is this some kind of joke? Where's the gas tank?
Mr. Krabs	Go on, SpongeBob. Ring the bell.
Mr. Krabs	Eh, harmony shmarmony. When do we get to see the treasure?!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, but I feel odd.
Mr. Krabs	As much as me pockets can carry?! Oh, if I'd only known when I woke up today, I'd have stopped at me tailors along the way, and had ten more pockets put on me pants, 'cause I think I hear a money avalanche!  Look at all this cash, hey, look at all this money! I hope me heart can take it!
Mr. Krabs	Can't you go any faster Sandy?
Mr. Krabs	I think I'm gonna cry!
Mr. Krabs	Yeesh, we need some customers in here.  What's gotten into you?
Mr. Krabs	Good boy.
Mr. Krabs	What? I thought you said you could pay for it!
Mr. Krabs	So, Patrick, how are you...?  What in blazes did you do?
Mr. Krabs	What the...? What are you doing?
Mr. Krabs	Here, boy, take this sack of loot and put her in me safe.
Mr. Krabs	He's right.
Mr. Krabs	Go get those AWOL do-gooders you talked me into hirin', and bring their patoots back here on the double!
Mr. Krabs	A-a-a watch.  See?
Mr. Krabs	I don't understand, Squidward. Where are all the customers? I know the Krusty Krab isn't Bikini Bottom's most prestigious eatery, but at least it's better than that salty old Chum Bucket across the street. And that's our only competition.
Mr. Krabs	Yes, of course! But how?
Mr. Krabs	I don't care about that. Tell me about the money.
Mr. Krabs	He's not digging for any gold I'm looking for.
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Dollar, allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Dollar.  What the barnacles is going on?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, where the barnacles is SpongeBob? This place is going down the toilet! Patties need flipping!
Mr. Krabs	Let me see that.  To whom that may concern, if you found this letter, that means  sincerely... AKA...AKA? Idiot Boy? IDIOT BOY?! It is SpongeBob! What am I gonna do without me fry cook?
Mr. Krabs	MR. SQUIDWARD!!! This device was me last chance to get this place back into ship shape. And since you destroyed it, I am ordering you to find SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Not so fast!  Bring back me number one fry cook first.
Mr. Krabs	All right, Mr. Squidward, a deal's a deal. Here's your fancy egg.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward? What have you done? You know what the Krusty Krab means to me, don't ya? And you took it upon yourself to bring all these, these customers, to me. Hey, don't worry folks, There's plenty of Squidward to go around. So everybody just line up and get your pocketbooks out, first will be a small fee of $14.98 per person everyone will get the opportunity to touch Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Hello, this be the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, I'll never understand what you just said, but if it's transportation you need, I know just the thing.  Ooh, this one's puttin' up a fight.  Fightin' too hard!  Gotta reel him in, Krabs. Cut a little slack,  then yank!  Cut some slack, then yank!  There he is. Ready for work. Quit whining, boy, and start pushing out them patties.
Mr. Krabs	Krabs, my lady.
Mr. Krabs	What the...!
Mr. Krabs	Well, I didn't know her husband was the chief of police!
Mr. Krabs	There ya are, Betsy! All good as new!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, Squidwart. You haven't seen any sign of... you know...  the cops! Have ya?
Mr. Krabs	Nothing! But if don't get out there and start cooking, I'll make ya start taking weekends off!
Mr. Krabs	Ah, if only there are two of you...what? One, two? There's two?! He looks like you. He smells like you. He tastes like you! Is he a hard worker, just like you?
Mr. Krabs	Money?  Burning?!  SpongeBob? Who's responsible for this?
Mr. Krabs	Yes, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Well, good. Because there are plenty of other relatives that got passed over for the job!
Mr. Krabs	What in the name of Neptune is going on? Oh. You broke your spatula. That's a shame. I'll order a another one tomorrow,boy.
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, well, this one time I...
Mr. Krabs	No, wait! I'll take 'em.
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, I am?
Mr. Krabs	Find anything special lately?
Mr. Krabs	Great! Well, share it with me!
Mr. Krabs	Can I borrow a penny?
Mr. Krabs	Back?
Mr. Krabs	It is?
Mr. Krabs	Uhh?
Mr. Krabs	Careful with those marquee ladders!
Mr. Krabs	...witness the terrifying challenges overcome by... by...
Mr. Krabs	Uhh, well, actually I was going to show you this flip book and...
Mr. Krabs	But what?
Mr. Krabs	You would?
Mr. Krabs	Tell where!
Mr. Krabs	It wasn't?
Mr. Krabs	Hmm... I just don't get it. If a free salad bar doesn't bring in customers, what will?!  Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Well, uhh, I was thinking more along the lines of live entertainment.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, you've got a deal. Make my little girl a star!
Mr. Krabs	Nice try. Your act's over, bub.
Mr. Krabs	You did it, Squidward! What a great show!
Mr. Krabs	Code blue?!  What's the matter boy?
Mr. Krabs	I agree, it's very suspicious. And he may have lured a few of our fair-weather customers in with some cheap entertainment, but our loyal customers, know quality when they taste it! So let's get in there, and serve 'em up a burger they tell their grand-guppies about!  Where's all my loyal customers?
Mr. Krabs	Mom!
Mr. Krabs	I think that it's safe to say, that no matter how diabolical Plankton's plans may be, he'll never have the loyalty, of me good customers.
Mr. Krabs	Thanks for your business.
Mr. Krabs	Never?
Mr. Krabs	Well, till you decide to start making them patties the way only you can I want you out of my place!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah. A whole day dedicated to getting away from you.
Mr. Krabs	Of course.  First we build a giant wooden effigy of you, then we burn it to the ground.  Whoo-hoo!! Burn, baby!  And dance on the ashes like there was no tomorrow.
Mr. Krabs	What's that?
Mr. Krabs	Uh, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	You know, when you get paid for sitting at home.
Mr. Krabs	No. Sorry, Squidward, your shift ended over two minutes ago.
Mr. Krabs	No! He's finally stolen me secret recipe!
Mr. Krabs	Who knows? I think you knows!
Mr. Krabs	He's just after me recipe. I'll prove it to you.  Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here.
Mr. Krabs	Listen up!
Mr. Krabs	Well, maybe on a discount.
Mr. Krabs	What? Why, I got a good mind to...
Mr. Krabs	Not now boy! We're in the middle of a public lishen! That no good, nose flartin...
Mr. Krabs	Sit, down!  Now you've worked here for quite some time, boy.
Mr. Krabs	It's time!  Now go! And make sure to guard it with your life!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!  What are you doing lolly gagging about? Get back to work!
Mr. Krabs	Well, do you have any leads, or clues?
Mr. Krabs	Then arrest this thief, Officer!
Mr. Krabs	I can explain!
Mr. Krabs	Your honor.
Mr. Krabs	What are you talking about?
Mr. Krabs	Plankton's trying to overthrow me business! He's got a customer that actually likes his food! You've gotta get that guy back on our side, with a couple of Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah?
Mr. Krabs	But to do that, I'd have to know how Plankton makes his Chum.  That's it boyo!  Where could it be?  There! Plankton's secret formula.  It's gotta be in here
Mr. Krabs	D'oh, just put me out of me misery!
Mr. Krabs	I ain't interested in same old regulars, SpongeBob! So I took out an ad in the Bikini Bottom Examiner to bring in some new customers! Twas a bargain too.  Only cost me a nickel. So tell me now, boy. How many new customers we got out there so far?
Mr. Krabs	Yes, they certainly are.  Please, allow me.
Mr. Krabs	That's right boy! And here's your very own camera! So you'll need it to document all them juicy stories you're gonna write. Now what are you waiting for, boy?
Mr. Krabs	: What do you mean we haven't sold any newspapers? Certainly this gentlemen would like a copy of the .
Mr. Krabs	": Yeah. Maybe instead of ""Man Watches Pole,"" you could say something like... oh... ""Man Marries Pole."" Then you can alter the photo a little to fit the headline and, see?  Now that's a juicy story!"
Mr. Krabs	: That's called editorial privilege, son. It gives you that extra oomph to move units. Besides, how could such a little news story, possibly affect Mrs. Puff in any way?
Mr. Krabs	: Well, they're certainly doing me some good.  Can you believe it? Look at all this loot!
Mr. Krabs	: What's wrong. boy? You sick or something?
Mr. Krabs	: Oh, darn tootin' I would! Now get out there, and bring me a juicy one!
Mr. Krabs	: People want wild juicy stories! That's what sells! Now I want your little yellow noggin, to come up with the wildest story ever! One that'll top all the others!
Mr. Krabs	: Excellent! We're gonna sell out in no time! We'll have to do another printing.  Huh?
Mr. Krabs	No! AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!
Mr. Krabs	A man works hard all week to keep his pants off all weekend.
Mr. Krabs	I promise.
Mr. Krabs	Don't say that. Here, would your friends want some pizza?
Mr. Krabs	Okay, okay, I'm going.
Mr. Krabs	This is mutiny!
Mr. Krabs	Maybe I should just sleep under the highway.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, SpongeBob, do you know anything about girls?
Mr. Krabs	Turn it off! Turn it off, I cant take it!
Mr. Krabs	No! Pearl and her no-good friends! Theyre probably destroying me house right now! Like this!  Oops! I dont care! Its not mine!  Oh, look! One of the home owners most prized possessions!  Adidas!
Mr. Krabs	Then get into Pearls party and find out what theyre doing!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, tell em its from me!
Mr. Krabs	Hello?  Pizza!
Mr. Krabs	You get into that party, or youre fired!
Mr. Krabs	Cost me what?
Mr. Krabs	No, SpongeBob, that doesnt cheer me up at all.
Mr. Krabs	You're not wearing shoes, lad. You're not going Section 8 on me, are ya?
Mr. Krabs	Of course not! Here. Just fan yourself with some of this junk mail I keep finding in me mail box.
Mr. Krabs	Boys, I forgot to tell ya! Close up shop. We're going to the beach today!
Mr. Krabs	Krabby Patty, fresh off the grill!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, there, young feller! How'd you like to be our first customer in over seventeen working days?
Mr. Krabs	Aaaaaaaaahhhhh!  Aaaaahhhhhh!
Mr. Krabs	Arrrgh! It's the Flying Dutchman!
Mr. Krabs	No, I...  Cashy! Please! Cashy is the closest thing to a friend I've ever had!
Mr. Krabs	What?
Mr. Krabs	Uh... where is that, exactly?
Mr. Krabs	Who said that?
Mr. Krabs	Excuse me sir, is this man giving you trouble?
Mr. Krabs	Say, that reminds mecan I have some money?
Mr. Krabs	Mother of pearl!
Mr. Krabs	Million... dollars... cash prize?!  Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!
Mr. Krabs	No living soul should have to suffer through what I've witnessed here today. Except maybe...
Mr. Krabs	Of course. They're just pretending.
Mr. Krabs	Ohh, fine.  You're the, uh, Short Order Boy,  and he's the... um, well, uh, Pink Patty.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, did I need something? Hmm, let me think. Did I need something?  Yes, I need something! I need you 2 to get back in there and show them who's boss! Show them what Short Order Boy and Pink Patty can really do!
Mr. Krabs	What are you doing out there?!
Mr. Krabs	End it?!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, who am I kidding? Goodbye, money.
Mr. Krabs	Hello, money!  Woo-hoo! Money, sweet money.
Mr. Krabs	Like we're really gonna turn all this money for...
Mr. Krabs	Well, I was gonna wait til this afternoon, but I guess I could show you now.
Mr. Krabs	There's Regular, Large, and the new Viking Size!
Mr. Krabs	Not so fast! Access to the mighty helmet will be granted to active promotion participants only. And only those who purchase Viking Size.
Mr. Krabs	Uh.....  You're gonna have to ask Squidward any more questions ya got. He's the smart one.
Mr. Krabs	"Aye, I come from a whole family of pirates. Gramps used to say, ""The Krabs Clan has been pirates for as long as we've had claws."" And he wanted me to be a pirate, too."
Mr. Krabs	I started to notice a recurring fee. I just wasn't turning enough profit. So I fired me crew and sold me ship. Twas also the last time I saw me granddad.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah.
Mr. Krabs	Way to go, fellars.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I...Heh, heh. So, have ya met me hearties?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, that salty sea air be so thick, ya can almost taste it.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, just a sec.  Look out, Grandpa! We're under attack!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, nothing. Look!
Mr. Krabs	Ar! Take that, ya, ya scurvy dog! Woo! Check the size of this, Granddad. Check the... Granddad?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, so depulsive.
Mr. Krabs	That disgusting, horrible thing is me daughter!
Mr. Krabs	I can explain.
Mr. Krabs	What? Oh, never mind that!  Just go home.
Mr. Krabs	Just a second.
Mr. Krabs	It's, it's, it's a pirate never lies!  And I've been a dirty liar! Everything you see is a lie! This sail is a lie!  This crew is a lie!  Even the ship is a lie!  All of it! All a lie!
Mr. Krabs	Goodbye, Granddad! What an honest man!
Mr. Krabs	Bleh!
Mr. Krabs	Get to work.
Mr. Krabs	What in the name of Davy Jones are you talking about?
Mr. Krabs	Well, why don't you just take them off?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, are you sure you're feeling shipshape?
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, come on, let me see them. I like babies.
Mr. Krabs	"Did you say ""fortune?""   $5.99, that's right. Get them while they last. Don't be shy, folks."
Mr. Krabs	Okay boy, get out there.
Mr. Krabs	Uh. Heh heh. It's a... it's a secret.
Mr. Krabs	You're in charge for the next 15 minutes.
Mr. Krabs	Ah, there's nothing like polished pincers to make you feel like a man!  Let's see how SpongeBob's doing as acting manager.  What the...??!! SpongeBob dancing like a goofball?
Mr. Krabs	And some stranger cooking Krabby Patties??!!  Squidward sleeping on the job??!! Ok, that's actually normal. SpongeBob! What have ye done to me Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs	Boy?
Mr. Krabs	That's not gonna be a problem, is it?
Mr. Krabs	Really... Why don't you go into town and pick up one of those hex drill thingies.
Mr. Krabs	What happened to your clothes, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Your little assistant? That's my little assistant you're talking to! What's going on here!?!
Mr. Krabs	Whoa, whoa, that's enough, lad. What do ya think, I'm made of ketchup? Now run along, boy.  That sounds like... a band of roaming tourists.  Wait, come back! Don't ya wanna give me your money?! They're a slippery bunch. What do I have to do to catch 'em, stand around out here all day?  What are you doing there, Patrick?
Mr. Krabs	Perfect. You'll be wearin' that hat in no time at all.  Hee hee hee.
Mr. Krabs	What does he think he's doing?!  They're walkin' right past him.  Patrick, you need to get their attention, boy.
Mr. Krabs	I saw it.
Mr. Krabs	You mean, CASH money?!
Mr. Krabs	That's right, I think we've finally found a job for you that you're good at. Being an absolute buffoon! If it's folly you crave, it can be found exclusively at the Krusty Krab. For just five dollars a head.
Mr. Krabs	What's with him?
Mr. Krabs	You want excitement? Well, what if I added a box?
Mr. Krabs	SEE THE PART TIME MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYEE FALL ATOP THIS TOWER INTO THIS BUCKET OF SPINY SEA URCHINS!
Mr. Krabs	Ready, Patrick?
Mr. Krabs	Patrick, why have you stopped falling?
Mr. Krabs	I don't think so.
Mr. Krabs	Not even close, you're fired. As long as I'm still standing, you will never wear this hat again!
Mr. Krabs	There, there, boy. There, there. It's not that bad. I'm sure you'll thinka something.
Mr. Krabs	Only if I get to cut your health benefit for ya.
Mr. Krabs	Only two customers? Customers are looking kinda scarce. . Must be low tide or something, eh Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, I'm afraid our worst fears have been realized.
Mr. Krabs	He stole the Formuler.
Mr. Krabs	Hold on now. We're almost there.
Mr. Krabs	Eh...BINGO! Giddy up boy, We're almost there.
Mr. Krabs	Come on SpongeBob...
Mr. Krabs	Her scurvy prom date stood her up, boy, and now she can't seem to find another.
Mr. Krabs	What do you mean?
Mr. Krabs	Never mind that, boy! You're taking Pearl to her prom!
Mr. Krabs	A-ha! Keep away from me precious little flower!  You almost stepped on it.
Mr. Krabs	Today's a big a day for The Krusty Krab.  So I want yous to listen up.  It's a perfect opportunity for Plankton to try and steal the Krabby Patty formula.
Mr. Krabs	Right. Study the map, stay extra vigilant. Don't fall asleep on the job. That means you, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	What, you expect me to spend money on a real security guard? You are my first line of defense, Patrick. So, look out for any suspiciorous characters.
Mr. Krabs	I'm tired today, Plankton.  You're just gonna have to launch yourself.
Mr. Krabs	Yes, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Here's your budget, boy.  Decorate it any way you want.
Mr. Krabs	Good work, boy. What, that's it?
Mr. Krabs	Okay, open your ears. These people have come from miles around because they love my patties. I want every employee on their best behavior.
Mr. Krabs	All right let's get this thing out of here. Me customers are waiting.
Mr. Krabs	Everybody, calm down. I spent a lifetime working in this restaurant, and I know there's only one way out of here.
Mr. Krabs	Well, according to the map, we just go straight, take a right between these three moldy tree stumps, then head towards that kidney-bean shaped pile of gravy.
Mr. Krabs	Come on down and...
Mr. Krabs	Ah, barnacles. It's just the Surveillance Room.
Mr. Krabs	Hmm, a crossroads.  I'll go this way, and SpongeBob,  you lead them down that way.
Mr. Krabs	Now, remember, you can never tell another living soul.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, what's with the creepy smile?
Mr. Krabs	Hey! Oh, no!  What am I going to do?  We gotta get out of here. Now!
Mr. Krabs	Hey!
Mr. Krabs	Yes.
Mr. Krabs	Ow!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, boy, we made it out!  Woo-hoo!  Money! Money! Money! Money!  Come on in folks.  No need to shove. Plenty of room for all your money! ay-yi... Oh! Where are all me customers?  They left.. with all their money?!
Mr. Krabs	Ah, 'tis a beautiful sight. It warms me heart.  Me Krabby Patty recipe! What's it  doin' out here? Whoa-ho! Shoulda known! Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	Stay away from the high-tension wires.  Allow me to open the door for a valued customer.
Mr. Krabs	stop spending money here? Well, don't worry, I'm certainly not going to keep you from doing what you want. Give him a Krabby Patty with the works!
Mr. Krabs	genius? Perhaps. Or maybe I'm just a little off.
Mr. Krabs	How dare you spend all the money I don't pay you at me arch-rival's business! Boy, Plankton's really cleaning up down there, which means it's time to start running into the ground.
Mr. Krabs	Not if I bury you first!
Mr. Krabs	Uh-huh. That's what I've been trying to tell you.  Comfort me!
Mr. Krabs	We have a deal. No more bickering.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, Plankton, we're free!
Mr. Krabs	But what about our deal?
Mr. Krabs	Capturing customers! I should've though of it sooner! But without Squidward, I need someone to work the register.
Mr. Krabs	The decorations over here look a little sparse. Why don't you hang up a few balloons or something?
Mr. Krabs	Leave it to your old boss here to capitalize on such a momentous occasion.
Mr. Krabs	See Neptune eat! Only five dollars! Only a few seats left!
Mr. Krabs	Nope, sorry. I guess that it's twenty dollars for for you then. Don't be shy folks. Seats are going fast.
Mr. Krabs	Oh! If Neptune doesn't cheer up soon, me business is ruined.
Mr. Krabs	Well, these highfalutin' types, they might appreciate that, don't you think? Why don't you try and razzle-dazzle them with all your pizazz?
Mr. Krabs	Great idea, go and play them another song.
Mr. Krabs	Neptune and friends wait! What about the party? What about me restaurant?
Mr. Krabs	Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! We don't want just you! We want your money too!
Mr. Krabs	That's strange. I'm sure I can remember screwing the cap back on the toothpaste, but here it is on the edge of the sink, plain as day. Heh heh! These are strange times we're livin' in.
Mr. Krabs	Pearl, this is terrible! I paid 30 bucks for that bed! 'Course, that was when you were a newborn. Maybe if I crunched a few numbers and checked the warranty, I couldPearl: I  need  food.
Mr. Krabs	Pearl, I somehow just realized what's happening.
Mr. Krabs	Darling, I searched the entire house. There's not a speck of food to be spoken of.
Mr. Krabs	Me money?
Mr. Krabs	Me money! What do you think yer doin'?  That ain't yours.  Thank you very much. When I get my hands on that boy...
Mr. Krabs	Yeah... Anyway, I'm gonna leave it out here while I clean out the safe. Don't let it out of your sight, boy-o.
Mr. Krabs	Need a little refresher, eh? Okay, boy. I'll run through the Krabby Patty formula one more time.
Mr. Krabs	Hold on.
Mr. Krabs	Thattaboy, SpongeBob! This is going to be a tough one though! There's no clear cut winner!  Watch out, SpongeBob. Squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout.  There might be a new face on the wall this month.
Mr. Krabs	No!
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! What's all the hubberub?  SpongeBob! What's all the hubberub?
Mr. Krabs	What?
Mr. Krabs	Somethin' is terribly wrong, Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	A gift?
Mr. Krabs	Never mind that now, I've got some new directions for yeh. From now on, I want you to fry up  two Patties for every Krabby Patty we sell!  One for the patty itself, and the  second, just for the grease! Then,  slather the grease from the second patty onto the first one and  Voalora! It's A deluxe Krabby Patty with extra flavor!
Mr. Krabs	Lil' lower! Lil' more! More! Lil' more! Okay, A little to the left now! Up a bit! Okay wait, that's too far. Alright, alright, perfect, right there!
Mr. Krabs	Quadruple goodness?!  We'll see about that.  Keep the grill goin' nonstop to crank out as much grease as possible!
Mr. Krabs	This is our latest product! It's pure grease on a paper plate!
Mr. Krabs	Are you gonna get that soup served to table 3 or are you gonna wait til it gets up and walks there itself?
Mr. Krabs	I guess this is it boy. The end of an era.
Mr. Krabs	Ah. It was all a dream!
Mr. Krabs	But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let the little guy go today.
Mr. Krabs	What was  about? Oh, probably just nonsense and babbling, as usual.
Mr. Krabs	All right, boy-o! I won't get rid of ya: on one condition.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, say no more. You go on home to your pet turtle or whatever.
Mr. Krabs	Free... labor? Why didn't ya say so?  Serve em' up, snail!
Mr. Krabs	Hm. And you'll like to upgrade to the toy package is that right?
Mr. Krabs	Avast, there, laddies. What's all this ruckus about now?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!  Report to me office.
Mr. Krabs	Now, this trip... I'm gonna teach ye all the cheapskate knowledge like you were the son I've never wanted!
Mr. Krabs	No.
Mr. Krabs	Maybe.
Mr. Krabs	Attention cheapskate attendees! I, Eugene Krabs, have only spent on me travel, the price of a one-cent stamp!  Thank you! Thank you! I'd like to see someone top that!
Mr. Krabs	You see that, laddie? That outstretched hand is one of the biggest dangers to becoming a true cheapskate:  He wants a tip.
Mr. Krabs	Go ahead! Give it a try!
Mr. Krabs	Hi, fellers!
Mr. Krabs	Lad, you're surrounded by stingy wisdom, so try to pick up some pointers. But whatever you do, don't lend anyone money.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, geez. I didn't think the competition would be so stiff this year!  I'm gonna need your help on this one!
Mr. Krabs	Well, good enough. Just make sure you exaggerate enough fer me to win!
Mr. Krabs	No, no, no, no, exaggerate the other way!
Mr. Krabs	"Heh heh. Well, could we ""exaggerate"" this pillow, too?"
Mr. Krabs	Thanks for ruinin' everything so I could win! Put er there, SpongeBob me boy!
Mr. Krabs	Then get your Captain's Quarters in the kitchen!
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward, you're in a chipper mood this morning, did you get an order of fancy decorative soaps in the mail or somethin'?
Mr. Krabs	Nice to have ya back Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Gahh! Blast you Squidward! You drive a hard bargain. I guess I could rustle something up for ya.
Mr. Krabs	uuhh.. Appears to be Corporal Sterling, lad. Heh...forgot all about that prank.  Squidward! Your locker is ready!
Mr. Krabs	I just sweet talked an old lady out of $20 for a Krabby Patty!
Mr. Krabs	Well, SpongeBob, I'd sure hate me customers to see you like this. Is there anything I can do to help?
Mr. Krabs	Uh, well, 'cause I'm actually in favor of that highway being built.
Mr. Krabs	C'mon, boy! Let's you and I go over and show that Plankton a piece of our minds!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, sorry.
Mr. Krabs	Wait a minute. You've been what?
Mr. Krabs	"Oh, why did I say ""aye""?"
Mr. Krabs	But Squidward, you can't leave! What if we have, a customer?
Mr. Krabs	The Krusty Krab can't stay in business. Not like this.
Mr. Krabs	I have no choice. And stop calling me Eugene.
Mr. Krabs	What?
Mr. Krabs	Praise Neptune.
Mr. Krabs	True as the deep blue.
Mr. Krabs	Aye, as a matter of fact, they do. And he puts them where you can never get them... in his soul bag.
Mr. Krabs	It's the real Flying Dutchman!
Mr. Krabs	Hmmm... Quite a conundrum you have here. It will be a cryin' shame to a certain someone if the information were to leak out to the authorities
Mr. Krabs	Err... interesting, I had something else in mind. Surprise SpongeBob! You got a new co-worker.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! I forgot to tell ya. You're taking a summer off! Have a good time! See ya!  Phew! That was close.
Mr. Krabs	Just don't let it happen again, Puff.
Mr. Krabs	Plankton! I just had that roof redone last week!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, go jump off a plank.
Mr. Krabs	She's a big girl Plankton, I have no control over what she does. Oh, And you better watch out. I think she's extra hungry today.
Mr. Krabs	Alright, SpongeBob. It's your turn!
Mr. Krabs	Goodbye, Pipsqueak!
Mr. Krabs	This is almost too fun!  Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!
Mr. Krabs	Secret fear?  What are you talkin' about?
Mr. Krabs	Avast, there. What are you all happy about?
Mr. Krabs	Of course.
Mr. Krabs	Well...OK. But only on one condition: that you both keep workin'. Because if just one Krabby Patty is late, I'm shuttin' you down!
Mr. Krabs	And all of them willin' to work for no pay!
Mr. Krabs	What did I tell you? You do your job, or I'm shuttin' you down!
Mr. Krabs	What's that, Mr. Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! You still haven't given me customers their Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	' SpongeBob! Whats the meaning of this?
Mr. Krabs	: Goodness, no! Here you are
Mr. Krabs	Wow. Shiver me shell wax. You're like a little money detecting... Uh... You know... A sneagle.
Mr. Krabs	I could.
Mr. Krabs	Then get back there and scrub the poop deck so to speak.
Mr. Krabs	You aren't taking him anywhere yet. You haven't greased the fryer yet.  Don't worry about Jerry. I'll make sure he gets his nightly craw.
Mr. Krabs	You sure make easy work.
Mr. Krabs	That's what they want you to know. Now take a long look.
Mr. Krabs	That a boy.
Mr. Krabs	I'm gonna' give him a snaily treat.
Mr. Krabs	Oh. no, no, no. Don't worry about Terry. He's in good claws.
Mr. Krabs	Hee, hee, hee, hee.
Mr. Krabs	Uh Oh. Pronto. Time for plan B!
Mr. Krabs	What do you mean you don't feel so good?
Mr. Krabs	Get ready for it now, boy me boy!  Ladies and gentlemen!  Thank you for your money!  Come on Harry! Let's go. Come on you!.
Mr. Krabs	Don't you have work you should be doing?
Mr. Krabs	Who do you think you are!  JACKPOT! Money, money, money, money. Come to papa.  Oh boy.
Mr. Krabs	Noooooooooooooooo!
Mr. Krabs	Ohh, Okay, Tibor I think I'm good.
Mr. Krabs	Pearl!!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob? SpongeBob, boy-o! SpongeBob can you hear me?
Mr. Krabs	Oh really? Well, I think you don't know who to talk to the ladies.
Mr. Krabs	Don't worry, Pearl, he's okay.
Mr. Krabs	Now, how do you propose we do that, huh? Wait, I know we just hit the magic reverse button on the giant vacuum cleaner.
Mr. Krabs	Speaking of re-claiming... alright Plankton, I know what you're up to but, the jigs up you little conniving pipsqueak! Huh?
Mr. Krabs	No way granny!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, you too SpongeBob. Have a good-  Night...
Mr. Krabs	Found out? Boy, you would have to get up pretty early to sneak a pair of buns past old, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs	Come on, boy! Spit it out!
Mr. Krabs	Yep. Just fabricated superstition. Right Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Well, we haven't seen a single customer all morning!
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, wait. You don't even have a contract.
Mr. Krabs	Well I'll be the slimy, son of a slithery, slippery sea slug, boy. It's here!
Mr. Krabs	See, told ya'
Mr. Krabs	Hey, SpongeBob so you think this fudgy stuff we're walking in is the eel's-
Mr. Krabs	He's awake!
Mr. Krabs	Madame Hagfish, we've got the gold doubloon you asked for.
Mr. Krabs	Well, it's like I told you before boy, there ain't no such thing as witches, or curses, or magical beings, or-
Mr. Krabs	As I was saying... It happened a long time ago... Patrick! ...to a pair of little kids.
Mr. Krabs	The Main Drain.
Mr. Krabs	Boys, there's more to that story about the Drain! You see...
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward, how many times do i have to tell you, the customers' jokes are always funny! Now, give the gentlemen a chuckle!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, yes. Of course, ma'am.  Try and behave yourselves, fellas.
Mr. Krabs	That's nothing to fuss over, boy. We'll just whip up a new batch, like we did in the old days.
Mr. Krabs	Sea Salt. SpongeBob:  Turmeric.
Mr. Krabs	Heavens, no. That's disgusting. All right, tell you what, why don't I just go fetch the formula? We'll settle this once and for all.
Mr. Krabs	I need to somehow get Plankton to stop comin' after me precious formula.
Mr. Krabs	Well, it's simple, Perch.  It seems keeping me secret formula in hand has proven to be all too temptin' for a  certain diminutive one-eyed criminal element of society.
Mr. Krabs	Formular, yeah.
Mr. Krabs	Well, all right then,  the formular is now stowed in a safe-deposit box in the ocean's largest, safest bank  in Way-far-out-town-ville.
Mr. Krabs	Good, let's get you over at the train station.
Mr. Krabs	You honestly didn't think I would have left you out of this elaborate equation, did you?
Mr. Krabs	Uh... You know, I just remembered, I'm late for a very important meetin'. Take care of it, will ya boy?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, throw that trash out and get back to work!
Mr. Krabs	I'm gonna go ahead and take care of souvenirs!
Mr. Krabs	And thanks so much for all your contributions! So are ya ready to put this thing in the ground?!
Mr. Krabs	Who's ready to eat some Krabby Patties, 'cause all that waiting in line's got you super hungry?
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy there, SpongeBob! I need you to work an extra 17 hour shift tonight!
Mr. Krabs	What do you want now, Mr. Pottymouth?
Mr. Krabs	All right boys, time to go ho-
Mr. Krabs	What am I running here, a nuthouse?
Mr. Krabs	That door squeak sounded decidingly disgruntled.  Me customers!  Why are you running off?
Mr. Krabs	What in blazes are you doing? That's it! You're done for the day!
Mr. Krabs	Patty's kr  What the...  TIME FOR THE SHELTER! Doomsday came sooner than I thought.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! THAT MAKES ME FURIOUS!
Mr. Krabs	OK! Good luck finding him!
Mr. Krabs	Sure! Wait, what's tomorrow?
Mr. Krabs	What, what?!
Mr. Krabs	No attic?!
Mr. Krabs	You heard me. A fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs	Okay, but make sure your pet is healthy, and clean!
Mr. Krabs	: It's comin' up on that time again. Okay, boy, fire her up.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I mean.
Mr. Krabs	In case you two haven't noticed, we got no customers! And we're not gonna get 'em back if you two lazy susans sit around the TV all day.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, that won't be necessary, boy. Just look around, see how he's roping in all these customers.
Mr. Krabs	Boy, stop this nonsense!
Mr. Krabs	Cut the spy lingo and just tell me, is there anything remarkable about the Sea Chicken Shack?
Mr. Krabs	A statue? How does a statue steal me customers? (static on other end of radio) SpongeBob? SpongeBob? (he's taken his wristband radio off and is now climbing on the giant chicken statue) Of course, Mr. Sea Chicken, you mad trickster, you, cater to the kids and the parents will foll-er. (cut to later at Krusty Krab) Boys, we don't have much time, so I'm gonna make this short and sweet. I need an artist, someone with a vision...
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, really? Who?
Mr. Krabs	1-tooth Sally?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, that's right, Squidward. You do dabble in the doodlin' doodly-doo.
Mr. Krabs	Well, that's 12 more seeing your art than yesterday.
Mr. Krabs	If you want the public to experience your cultural input, get it ready by 8:00am.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What do you think you're doing? I'm...shy.
Mr. Krabs	Or this? (poses with a golden discus)
Mr. Krabs	How long am I gonna have to stay like this?
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, yeah, just show me. (Squidward pulls back the curtain)
Mr. Krabs	Whatever that means. But is it safe for kids to play on?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! I can't let kids play on thatthatthat weapon. I'm gonna get my pants sued off.
Mr. Krabs	Ravenous?  That means hungry!  Krabby Patties! Get your Krabby Patties! Only 3.99 each!  That'll be 54.95.  Don't care for Krabby Patties, huh? Well, maybe there's something else on the menu you'd like!
Mr. Krabs	I'm not impressed...
Mr. Krabs	Why? Would you like to buy one?
Mr. Krabs	Up here boys! Take a look!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! Three more Krusty Dogs! Pronto!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, forget about making those Patties! Just make the wieners!
Mr. Krabs	Ah, never mind. I'll just cross it off.  No more Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs	You're back in yer old kitchen. And the paramedics were here to revive ye.
Mr. Krabs	Alright! Those wieners aren't going to rotisserie themselves. Everybody back to work.
Mr. Krabs	Yea, good point.
Mr. Krabs	Perfect! And keep them Krabby Patties coming, boy!
Mr. Krabs	Back to work, boy.
Mr. Krabs	Hmm, looks like him and Patrick are trying to haul the loot for themselves. Come on, Squidward. We got to let those two dingalees lead us straight to the Mauna Loa!
Mr. Krabs	So you thought you could hide the treasure from old Mr. Krabs, did ya?
Mr. Krabs	I knew I'd find it! Check it out, fellas, cool, hard doubloons!
Mr. Krabs	Ticket booth?!
Mr. Krabs	Well, I'm not!
Mr. Krabs	Step right up, don't be shy! Experience the amusement and terror of The Wreck of the Mauna Loa!
Mr. Krabs	Okay, people, let's not do anything we might regret!
Mr. Krabs	What was that?
Mr. Krabs	No more.
Mr. Krabs	What did I just get through telling ye, lad?
Mr. Krabs	Hmmm. Alright, me boy, I'll give you a second chance. But no more karate. It's poisoning your mind.  Mmm, mammals.
Mr. Krabs	I love money-ay!
Mr. Krabs	Did you hear something?
Mr. Krabs	Yes. I mean Squidward. WHERE IS HE?!
Mr. Krabs	I didn't even know you had ankles.
Mr. Krabs	Well now, Squidward!  Let's not be hasty!  I'll take care of your poor little ankle personally.  SpongeBob! Squidward needs first aid
Mr. Krabs	Ok.
Mr. Krabs	Oh nothing.
Mr. Krabs	Shhhh.  You gotta keep it a secret from Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Coming!
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, after all I've done for you, you've called the OWS.
Mr. Krabs	I'm gonna make you pay.
Mr. Krabs	Nonsense.  Run along little fella. Enjoy your Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs	Yeeh, those day are over, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	What!? Some imitation patty is tryin' to steal me business? Oh, but me customers are loyal.  They won't leave for some nasty Flabby Patty.  The Flabby Patty shack has stolen all me customers!
Mr. Krabs	Bet I will!
Mr. Krabs	Dig, SpongeBob, dig.
Mr. Krabs	Grandma.
Mr. Krabs	I've heard all I'm gonna hear from the likes of you.
Mr. Krabs	Brilliant work laddie.  Hey, how come you're not trampled.
Mr. Krabs	Okay, fine.  We'll work together.
Mr. Krabs	Little more. Little more.
Mr. Krabs	Yes! The recipe is mine!
Mr. Krabs	Now, let's see what's the flabby that's in this patty.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, and how to comically bludgeon meself.
Mr. Krabs	And why is that, Mr. Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	We did?
Mr. Krabs	Oh nonsense, we'll build it for free!
Mr. Krabs	I'm sorry, what?
Mr. Krabs	There we go, problem solved.
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward! Any customers?
Mr. Krabs	You have any idea what a real microphone and speaker costs?!
Mr. Krabs	Replace what?
Mr. Krabs	Well that's nice! I'm still billing you for the damages!
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! There's a line of customers out there a million miles long!
Mr. Krabs	Ah! But officer! I a...I a...Listen!
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Krabs	Stay back! Take Squidward, not me!  Oh, hi Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Ha! When fetching money is involved, nobody topples me!
Mr. Krabs	Sniff out the money, little guys! Come on! Marsh!  Wai-wait a minute. I was gonna feed ya! Honest!
Mr. Krabs	Much appreciate it, boy!
Mr. Krabs	Hey Squidward, what is it with the extra foot, buddy?
Mr. Krabs	This is it!
Mr. Krabs	Weren't bravery that got us out. Let's just say... We had to wait... for nature, to take its course.
Mr. Krabs	Duped? You don't mean by...
Mr. Krabs	No offense, but we're not going to catch Plankton moving at a snail's pace.
Mr. Krabs	And where's my formula?
Mr. Krabs	This will only take a minute.
Mr. Krabs	Then hand over my formula.
Mr. Krabs	Huh?
Mr. Krabs	Don't eat me, eat Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Well, I don't know. That's what they used to call it back in the
Mr. Krabs	Huh?  Ooh, money! Money, money, money, money, money, money, money!  What the?  SpongeBob!  Patrick!  What's the meaning of this?
Mr. Krabs	And here's your patty! One more art patty, Mr. Star!
Mr. Krabs	Can we skip the magic and get right to the free money?
Mr. Krabs	Wohoo! Works for me!  Gentlemen, I'm leaving you in-charge! See you when I see ya!
Mr. Krabs	Whee, ah ha ha!
Mr. Krabs	Did you hear that?  I could've sworn that I heard Plankteron!
Mr. Krabs	I'm feeling lucky!
Mr. Krabs	Oo, what's all this? Free Land Food, sounds so exotic.  Huh, this looks promising.  That tastes like putrefied coral stems dipped in rotten butter sauce.
Mr. Krabs	Hm, watch me sucker this guy. That will be a mere one hundred dollars.
Mr. Krabs	Me costumers! Aw, this vacation is a total bust!
Mr. Krabs	Who's ready to look at some vacation pictures?
Mr. Krabs	Relax boy! I'm just going on vacation for a few days.  Yesiree laddy! I think the old Krusty Krab can afford a few days in dried up while I take little Pearl to a long, overdue vacation. And I was kinda hoping, that you come along with us, SpongeBob.  Come along with us, SpongeBob. Come along with us...  Now, tell me about
Mr. Krabs	Great! We'll have some fun!
Mr. Krabs	Eh... It still is! SpongeBob's... like a son to me! Plus he'll pay a top dollar to tag along.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, cheer up pumpkin puss! We're almost there!
Mr. Krabs	The place we are going is 100 times better than that old amusement park!
Mr. Krabs	Ok! We're here! You can open your eyes now!
Mr. Krabs	Is this the most exciting day in you life?
Mr. Krabs	Just paper? That's like saying the ocean is just water! Or, or the Krabby Patty's just a... a... a sandwich!
Mr. Krabs	Thanks SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	I'd say! I almost had that quarter's phone number!
Mr. Krabs	Oh no you don't! You filthy dollar wrestler!
Mr. Krabs	Mine! I haven't charged you yet for tagging along on me vacation!
Mr. Krabs	The suds?
Mr. Krabs	No, wait! Wait!
Mr. Krabs	What in Neptune's name is going on?  Come back!  SpongeBob, what in the blue barnacles, are you up to?!
Mr. Krabs	Okay, let's go see those ghosts, fellers! We'll catch 'em and take their gold!
Mr. Krabs	Super! Let's go catch us some treasure! So what do you say, SpongeBob! Are ya ready!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, don't be silly, SpongeBob! There's no such things as germs.  Heads up, Squidward!  Hey, Patrick, think fast!
Mr. Krabs	"Hmm. So this is limbo. Well, at least I have a sack full of doubloons to spend eternity with. Uh-oh. Gotta use the can!  Ooh. There's a bit of luck. A portable potty. What's this here? ""Insert doubloon?"" Nooooooooooooo!"
Mr. Krabs	Me gold!
Mr. Krabs	Hmm. Those must be worth something down here.
Mr. Krabs	Cabbage, Green Backs, MONEY!!
Mr. Krabs	And that's why your promotion means a 50% cut in salary, understand, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Since when do you care about stealing?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Good point.
Mr. Krabs	Why ever not?
Mr. Krabs	I meant whatever you need to get rid of your blemish, not liquidate me retirement fund.
Mr. Krabs	For a second there, I thought a towering, hideous, mind-boggling abomination was standing here, staring at me in my own living room! But then I realized...  it's only my old, beloved daughter, Pearl.  Oh, Pearl. No, no, no need for these expensive trips to the spa. But don't worry, SpongeBob here will take care of it. I have more important measures to take care of.  Me jewwweells!
Mr. Krabs	That's right! All the soap Pearl and I use comes from this machine. And the best part is, it runs on 100% pure leftover Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs	Well, if you want to split hairs, I suppose--
Mr. Krabs	Help! Police! Thief!  Stop that whale!
Mr. Krabs	But how are you gonna get them down?
Mr. Krabs	What better way to spend an afternoon than trolling the sea vent for spare change.  Whooh!  There's got to be a small fortune than discarded paperclips in there!  I knew this place looked familiar. [ What's this? Goodness, that must be Sandy's Treedome dwelling, and inside looks to be the largest soybean I have ever layed me eyestocks on. Now this bears getting a closer look.  Good afternoon, Miss Sandy.
Mr. Krabs	Seems so much bigger once your inside.
Mr. Krabs	Tell me about your giant soybean.
Mr. Krabs	Eh, Bubble Buddy, huh? That guy still owes me money! So, what's the little deadbeat's name?
Mr. Krabs	Well, would you look at that. I never felt this clean on a weekday. Why don't you take into the kitchen and let him play with the dirty dishes?
Mr. Krabs	You really sent him over the edge this time.
Mr. Krabs	Why all the shivering of the timbers Mr. Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Time for your break
Mr. Krabs	Wait a minute. Why am I dressed in a leotard?
Mr. Krabs	Ok, let's not overdo it.
Mr. Krabs	Me plate, me buns, me mustard,  me Fiasco.
Mr. Krabs	Each!
Mr. Krabs	Of course, Officer. Heh, can't let me fry cook rot in this place. It'll ruin me business! Especially, now that the Fiasco's finato!
Mr. Krabs	Thanks for rescuing us SpongeBob. But what are we going to do with all of this green slop?
Mr. Krabs	"The whole town has turned against me! And I have no idea why.  ""Because the Krabby Patty is terrible"".  Krabby Patty? Terrible? How do those words even go together?"
Mr. Krabs	I'm all ears.
Mr. Krabs	I don't remember saying anything like that.
Mr. Krabs	Not this time boy, it's all over for the good old Krusty Krab, it's probably best if you start looking forward for a new job, boy, maybe in the different way like.
Mr. Krabs	Sure thing, SpongeBob. Hop in!  Did you hear what?
Mr. Krabs	Your absence is costing me money!
Mr. Krabs	You got it kiddo!
Mr. Krabs	Heads up!  Careful, boy. I thought I'd install a grill in your TV room for those nights where you have to bring work home with you.
Mr. Krabs	And, since you're such a satisfied customer, I only charged you double.
Mr. Krabs	Seriously son you gotta lighten up. Well good night kiddo.
Mr. Krabs	Free! Now what kind of barnacle would throw out a perfectly good computer?
Mr. Krabs	She's loading up. Now let's see how this dial up thingy works.  This thing does text mails right?
Mr. Krabs	She's malfunctioning
Mr. Krabs	Wait! Where ya goin? Smooth, SpongeBob, real smooth.  Let's talk this out.
Mr. Krabs	Yeehaw!
Mr. Krabs	Seriously? Did you just say money?
Mr. Krabs	Oh great. There goes me revenue. What am I gonna do now?
Mr. Krabs	I don't think so.  You used too much mustard!
Mr. Krabs	Hmm... what would about sleep, young man. Did you get enough sleep?
Mr. Krabs	Miss work? If you keep making mistakes like that, boyo, there will be no Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs	Boyo?
Mr. Krabs	What are you doing? That's not the sink!
Mr. Krabs	Dow, uh, nuh, no, no boy. It's terrible.
Mr. Krabs	What? Are you out of your liquid-absorbing mind?
Mr. Krabs	Until one day, when he stuck his tongue out for the 444th time,  his face froze with his tongue sticking out...
Mr. Krabs	So are you fonna keep making faces, boys?
Mr. Krabs	Hey, you all right boy, eh, look a little killy-wompish walking in here.
Mr. Krabs	: Penny, penny, penny, penny.
Mr. Krabs	Face me when I'm talking to you boy.  So I can see your face.
Mr. Krabs	I'm losing business, because you thought I was telling one of me stories?! Why, this makes me so angry! I could just... just... just... ahhh! NO, I can't move my face. I've got a Face Freeze too!!
Mr. Krabs	Well, you don't look any sicker than you usually do. You know what. I'm better give you the old navy whatsoever just to be sure.
Mr. Krabs	Forehead feels normal.  Now let's see those kneecaps.  Reflexes are a little slow. But I'd expect that from you.
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Krabs nothing!
Mr. Krabs	Neptune's Knee-highs, lad! How many times do I have to remind you to knock?!
Mr. Krabs	Squidward. But I checked out that slimy green cashier personally, and if he's sick, then I'm the next mayor of Marbleway Mountain. That doesn't sound like a bad gig actually.
Mr. Krabs	He can't cook in this condition. No cooking, no patties. No patties, no money.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, everything all right in here?
Mr. Krabs	Well, I can't just stand by while me restaurant becomes a breeding ground for infection. SpongeBob, go home. That's an order!
Mr. Krabs	I told you. I could run this place all by myself. Blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back.
Mr. Krabs	Atten--  Attention, Krusty Krab  patrons. Behold!
Mr. Krabs	No. Next, please.
Mr. Krabs	No.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I'm sorry, but it's me restaurant and I can do what I please. Besides, I know you'll try to analyze that patty and find out me secret formula.
Mr. Krabs	Eh, uh, no. He's out of town.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, fine.
Mr. Krabs	Wrong! It's five hundred thousand three hundred and none. You are one over the mark. You lose.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob needs to clean the grill first.
Mr. Krabs	The show that comes with a free Krabby Patty.  See?
Mr. Krabs	He was beloved by all the good-hearted people in the world. Alas, there is also a villain in this story, by the name of  Pl-- Flankton.
Mr. Krabs	Alright, SpongeBob, we can't stall him any longer. Make it a good one, laddie. This may be the last Patty you'll ever cook.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	So.
Mr. Krabs	It warms my heart to see that little twerp fail. Okay, boyo, fun time's over.  Now go fish them buns out of the toilet. Oh, yeah  and put these seeds back on 'em.
Mr. Krabs	What's goin' on out here? Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	Me secret formula? How did you get that?
Mr. Krabs	Woo-hoo! Got it! Hey, who are you calling cheap?
Mr. Krabs	: Shh!  What's gotten into you? High-faluting customers don't bark at the top of their lungs likea seadog.
Mr. Krabs	Reservation? In this sinkhole?!
Mr. Krabs	This is delicious! No!!!!!! I'm ruined!
Mr. Krabs	I've been conducting a little research! Where's Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	How about you, Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Over-what who?
Mr. Krabs	Great! This is a dream come true! SpongeBob, get back behind the grill, and Patrick, buy something or get out!
Mr. Krabs	Hmm. What could be the doings of this stranger?
Mr. Krabs	I'm not going anywhere!. You're the one who is moving!!
Mr. Krabs	At least i have customers.
Mr. Krabs	I...I...uh... My...my patties are dangerous because...because they're so...uh...uh...they're so-
Mr. Krabs	Not him. I'm referring to the large crowd gathered at the Chum Bucket. It appears they are actually giving Plankton... MONEY?!
Mr. Krabs	But... but...   No! I'm not going anywhere!
Mr. Krabs	Goodbye, Krusty Krab!   Eh?
Mr. Krabs	Wait, I saw it first! Hah!  Mine, mine! Huh?!
Mr. Krabs	Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?
Mr. Krabs	Would you like a job, starting now?
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.
Mr. Krabs	Six! One, two...  I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.
Mr. Krabs	Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure.
Mr. Krabs	Eight paces, now that's a good start lad.
Mr. Krabs	It's Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.
Mr. Krabs	Now, don't you feel more like pirates?
Mr. Krabs	"Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, ""okie dokie, then."" A pirate says, ""arrgh!"""
Mr. Krabs	Arrgh, we're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. This is it boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.
Mr. Krabs	Weast? What kind of compass you reading lad?
Mr. Krabs	You'll stay with me then?
Mr. Krabs	Sneaking peeks at me treasure?
Mr. Krabs	"""X"" marks the spot!"
Mr. Krabs	We finally found it.
Mr. Krabs	All for one.
Mr. Krabs	All for one.
Mr. Krabs	Wait! I'm captain of this crew. Where's my reward?
Mr. Krabs	Excuse me, Colonel! I'll be taking over from here on out!
Mr. Krabs	Mornin' Squidward!  Tour bus, sound equipment, check! All I need now is a...roadie? Now where in Neptune how I'm ever gonna find...
Mr. Krabs	Alright roadie, start unloading the hooey!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah...eh, what's so funny!?
Mr. Krabs	Wait a minute...what's that gonna cost me?
Mr. Krabs	Well, here we are! Our next gig!
Mr. Krabs	I pawned it! To raise the cash for the concert tour!
Mr. Krabs	What a happy celebration!
Mr. Krabs	WHAT!?
Mr. Krabs	This ain't our next concert!
Mr. Krabs	Were we in the Navy together?
Mr. Krabs	' ' How'd the show go boy?
Mr. Krabs	Good news boys! We only sustained a flat tire! Patrick, go get the spare lad!
Mr. Krabs	Unbelievable! They actually gathered a crowd! To think that all of these people came out to the middle of the desert to see Squidward and SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Who?  Get Paid Back from Mr. Krabs Line starts here...
Mr. Krabs	Collecting time!?
Mr. Krabs	That's me boy!
Mr. Krabs	Patrick! I knew our number one customer wouldn't let us down.
Mr. Krabs	Hehehehe, not a problem ma'am. It's the least I can doooooo!  Sorry, lady, you're on you're own.
Mr. Krabs	Whaaaaaaaat?! Alright, that does it!
Mr. Krabs	You've disabled my employees and trashed me restaurant?! Think you might go for the Bubble now?
Mr. Krabs	I'm taking you back to school!
Mr. Krabs	It's 1 minute till opening time. Where are me employeries? I don't pay them to be late.
Mr. Krabs	No buts! Get to work, you two!
Mr. Krabs	What in blazes is going on he...... Whoa! Mr. Squidward!  Where are your manners?
Mr. Krabs	What's all the ruckus!?
Mr. Krabs	Plankton!? Ah that's all we need. Beat it ya crook! We have enough pests already!
Mr. Krabs	Oh no, you don't!  Grrrrr.....  Mallet please!
Mr. Krabs	ME MONEY!!!  Did I get it!?
Mr. Krabs	Plankton?
Mr. Krabs	Now get in there, Planktonella, and lure that little rotten health hazard out of me livelihood!
Mr. Krabs	Holy mother of Pearl! Batten down the hatches!  It's a stampede!
Mr. Krabs	Here goes nothing!
Mr. Krabs	Farther!
Mr. Krabs	Not far enough! Keep going!
Mr. Krabs	What is it!?
Mr. Krabs	They got past me! Me restaurant!
Mr. Krabs	Well, thanks to your hard work, the Krabby Patty recipe is safe!
Mr. Krabs	Barnacles, no.  The customers keep passing off their dirty money. So we're cooking up the only solution powerful enough to clean it.
Mr. Krabs	...blow our faces off.
Mr. Krabs	Pull yourself together, boy. So your spatula snapped. Go get yourself a new one!
Mr. Krabs	All right, good night, boyo. Headin' home. Thanks for all the extra greenbacks you earned me today.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, no! Uh, I mean, it was your talkin' spatula, you say? That you got from Plankton? Well, why didn't you say so?  Here. Give your talkin' spatula this recipe.
Mr. Krabs	Quite a volatile concoction, eh, Planky?
Mr. Krabs	Why in the world would I want to do that?
Mr. Krabs	But I don't wanna!
Mr. Krabs	Don't worry. He's about to get what's coming to him.
Mr. Krabs	I'M IN MONEY HEAVEN!!!
Mr. Krabs	Good day, madam! I would like to take a look at your safe, please!
Mr. Krabs	Hello,  young missy!
Mr. Krabs	It's all coming together now...
Mr. Krabs	WAIT!!!  Uh, what you're doing? Penny doesn't want to be crammed in there with all those other coins. She wants a money condo of her own!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, penny...I'll miss... It's inhuman I tell ya! Penny, penny...one last kiss goodbye.  It's just you and me now little penny! It's a wee bit cramped in here!
Mr. Krabs	You look absolutely stunning tonight, Mrs. Greenback. Waiter!  Oui, oui, monsieur, what can I get you and zee lady tonight?  The lady would like to start with a million clams. A side of investments, and hold the taxes. I'll have the same. But with extra no taxes. Eh. Such a friendly fella. Good lookin' too. I'm almost gonna regret not giving him a tip.  Hello?
Mr. Krabs	I'm locked in the bank vault, and having the time of me life. Oh, and I think I'm running out of oxygen, and it's making me lose me mind.
Mr. Krabs	I got you now, money sucker! That is it, you nimbrid! It's you, or me now! Just you and me!  I concurred the money dragon! It's history! Woo hoo!
Mr. Krabs	What's the big kurfuffle? Oh, it's you. Only what's on the menu, old-timer!
Mr. Krabs	Err... Scram. This conversation's making me dizzy.
Mr. Krabs	Or me furniture.
Mr. Krabs	Never hold a seance boy-o... without me permission, because ghosts are like relatives. Once you let them in, they never leave!
Mr. Krabs	No.
Mr. Krabs	Oh,  Kenny the Cat. Well, he's a sensationality.
Mr. Krabs	Ah, the cat of the hour is back!
Mr. Krabs	Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	I see your point. But still, I'm not paying you to dream sweet nothin's! Do something! Pick up a mop, a broom, uh, a window wiper, a spatula, even!
Mr. Krabs	Well, that's very nice, boy, thank you. But, you see, I'm tryin' to give Squidward a task.
Mr. Krabs	I guess SpongeBob has a handle on all the Krusty Krab duties. Which leaves you with all the extracirculars!  Like shinin' me shoes!
Mr. Krabs	For...for...  ...a visit from...the Yeti Krab.
Mr. Krabs	You won't think so if that big, hairy fellow wants to eat ya!  Yeah. Now, listen up, boys! Bossman Krabs is steppin' out for a minute.  But I want this tub of laundry done before I come back, or...
Mr. Krabs	Uh, Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Refinish me floors!
Mr. Krabs	Well, actually, SpongeBob, uh, there's two words. And they're not very good. You're fired.
Mr. Krabs	You know I love you like a son. But you can't argue with a nickel.
Mr. Krabs	So, uh, if you could just hand over your spatula. Um... I'll just take that.
Mr. Krabs	Wait! Come back!  That was me last customer.  SpongeBob?  Squidward, you found him!
Mr. Krabs	Yoo-hoo!
Mr. Krabs	What are you doing, boy?! You're scaring all me customers with your foul stench!
Mr. Krabs	There you go!  Now get to work!
Mr. Krabs	Fine, fine.
Mr. Krabs	Argh!  Me eyes! What are you doing, Mr. Squidward?!
Mr. Krabs	Melancholy and self-doubt are bad for business. Make a note of it.
Mr. Krabs	How much do they charge you at this driving school of yours?
Mr. Krabs	Sure, anything for me little angel Pearl.
Mr. Krabs	And that goes for every kind of schooling. Why, there ain't nothing truly important, you can't learn on the streets with half a jigger of common sense and your own two claws. Now, put 'er in gear!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah. Well, you know, what we need is a change of venue.
Mr. Krabs	I suppose so. Now slowly inch forward and we'll check out the damage.
Mr. Krabs	Just take a look around, boy-o: home sweet home. Nothing to make you twitchy and jumpy. Oh, just the opposite, in fact. A place so soothing and sweet, like a mother's gentle lullaby on a soft summer's night.  Oh, brother. Let's start with something simple: a little trip down the street to Patrick's house.
Mr. Krabs	"Okay, that was just fine, but next time, wait until I say, ""Put 'er into gear."""
Mr. Krabs	You'll certainly learn the way of the boat with this here top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art technological simulator.
Mr. Krabs	Saw that coming.
Mr. Krabs	That's right. My style was to dive in with both feet, claws snapping.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, he's colorful, all right. But he's also going to teach you how to drive. Now, go!  Atta boy! ] There you go, SpongeBob. Did you see how Gary did that?
Mr. Krabs	Why, yes. Yes, officer, it is.
Mr. Krabs	Quiet, boy! Let me handle this.
Mr. Krabs	This ticket's coming out of your paycheck, boy.
Mr. Krabs	: Did you bring money this time?
Mr. Krabs	I smell something burning.
Mr. Krabs	Mmm-hmm. Sounds to me like you're wasting me precious ingredients! Listen SpongeBob, just because there's no customers doesn't mean you can't do something productive.
Mr. Krabs	Ohhohohohoo! Hi Pete!
Mr. Krabs	No! Not his productivity!
Mr. Krabs	Gee, SpongeBob. Do you think if I threw a picnic your productivity would increase?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, don't think of it as just toilet paper, it has thousands of uses.
Mr. Krabs	Here let me show ya. Go out for a long one, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Hmm. Heh, I don't see it anywhere.
Mr. Krabs	"""The greatest comp..."""
Mr. Krabs	I have? Wait. Oh yeah.
Mr. Krabs	Just what do ya think you're doin', Plankton?
Mr. Krabs	Ha! Go on, SpongeBob! Show this upstart how we chuck the old mustard plate around!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, would you mind helpin' me with my zipper?
Mr. Krabs	Ooh. I think this mayo has gone bad.
Mr. Krabs	Are you sure you don't want to?
Mr. Krabs	You can never have too many!
Mr. Krabs	That's such great advice!
Mr. Krabs	You saved me, boy. How did you do it?
Mr. Krabs	When he goes, you can go.
Mr. Krabs	It was a day just like this one. The wind was howling!  And me ship was being tossed about, like a rag doll on a trampoline!  I was in the galley! Cooking up grub for me crew to keep their mind off this horrible squall!  It was just then that he bursts into the galley!
Mr. Krabs	But that's... That's madness!
Mr. Krabs	Aye, sir! I understand, sir! Chafed!
Mr. Krabs	Aye-aye, sir!
Mr. Krabs	Slop.
Mr. Krabs	Cherries jubilee.
Mr. Krabs	But I thought I could dupe the other one sure than need a rise.
Mr. Krabs	Listen to me, Captain! This is gonna get real ugly real fast! We've got to get to the cannons!
Mr. Krabs	That's it!  Come with me, lad!  Direct hit!
Mr. Krabs	Ha-ha! The sunburn brigade!  Ha-ha! Me plan worked! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!
Mr. Krabs	What?! Where's SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, excuse me, me lovely. Maybe I've got the wrong house here. But I can't say I'm disappointed. I was thinkin' of me old matey SpongeBob...
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, have you lost your ever lovin' mind? You cannot be sneezin' all over me Krabby Patties! The customers don't like it. Except for that guy.
Mr. Krabs	Nope, it's good as that. Not only do I supply the Eating Contest but I get to sell my profilating patties to all the hungry spectators!. I had to grease a few wheels but it was worth it.
Mr. Krabs	What do you mean one!
Mr. Krabs	I couldn't give a seafit for Founders Day. I need sales boy, sales is what I need. Oh if only there was someone dumb and hungry enough to take on Ol' Oswald McNulty.
Mr. Krabs	I'm talking about Oswald McNulty! He comes here every year with his big city ways and his extremely relaxed throat muscles and he shows us up a bunch of rubes. Rubes! And on Founders Day no less! We need a home-town hero to make me lots of mone- I mean return the belt to Bikini Bottom! He-he, He-he.
Mr. Krabs	Well let's see how your tummy handles these patties Mr. likes-to-eat.
Mr. Krabs	Son, can you eat faster?
Mr. Krabs	Look at that devious face, a face without pity, cold dead eyes, like a sharks eyes. What is Oswald McNulty doin' that Patrick Star is not!
Mr. Krabs	Don't act bad bucket boy, we're gonna need  a hundred more patties.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, yeah, that's wonderful, move back. Be sure to bring your friends!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no problem,
Mr. Krabs	You made the right choice kid!
Mr. Krabs	Soon we'll have all the concessions in the stadium! Paying for the naming rights will make me millions!
Mr. Krabs	Ow!
Mr. Krabs	Ooh! I like that!
Mr. Krabs	Ok! But you're gonna miss the cheer leaders!
Mr. Krabs	Uhh, excuse me sir, that door is for employees only, ohh! It's SpongeBob!  There's something different about you today? You seem more, able bodied.
Mr. Krabs	Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah,Alright, alright, that's enough!  I see it was a mistake to put you behind the register! Your just looking to good for such a simple meaning of work!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, you're right, you're too good for this place.
Mr. Krabs	How can I watch the movie with all this blubbering going on out here?
Mr. Krabs	Is it true that everything is free?
Mr. Krabs	Hey! Join us, boy! Ho-ho! I can't believe I'm allowed to lift these...  really heavy... pieces of metal for free!
Mr. Krabs	Yes! Yes I do!  Because I sincerely want to thank you for a truly life-changing experience! Sucker!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, Larry! Thanks for all the free steam! Ha-ha! Sucker.
Mr. Krabs	When you mess with me business, ya mess with me money!
Mr. Krabs	You still here?
Mr. Krabs	Heh.  Yeah, well... so, um... what's a nice denomination like  doin'... on a bench like this?
Mr. Krabs	You know somethin'?  You look like a million bucks when you smile.  Cashina, would you make this old crab's day  and allow me to take you to a place where you can buy me dinner?
Mr. Krabs	...for delicious kisses!  Cashina, would you mind if I kissed you?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no, no!  I was, uh...  I was polishin'... this jewelry... with me... mouth hole... you see.  Like this!  Right, hmm...
Mr. Krabs	Well, she's...  ...everything I've ever wanted in a woman.
Mr. Krabs	Oh... I haven't been this nervous since me first boatswain's ball.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! You're gonna be me wedding planner.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, what? Oh, I'll tell you everything. No matter how embarrassed, I went to bed until I was 40. My armpits smell like tarter sauce when I'm afraid.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, anything for you, baby. (He looks in both directions, Left and Right) I'm gonna whisper it to you, just in case there's any prying ears out there.
Mr. Krabs	You... monster!
Mr. Krabs	I have no idea, Pearly.
Mr. Krabs	You can waste your own.
Mr. Krabs	I was talkin' to the money.
Mr. Krabs	Now back to work!
Mr. Krabs	I'm sorry, son, but i have a business to run. I'm gonna have to let you go.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, you old patty junkie! Welcome home son!
Mr. Krabs	[] Mr. Squidward, what the devilfish do you think your doing?!
Mr. Krabs	Well, you make a good point. Lean in boy! []
Mr. Krabs	Well, I did it. I calculated 1 paycheck down into 300 separate tiny checks. Only one of you left? Here.
Mr. Krabs	Hmm...your paycheck oughtta cover it!
Mr. Krabs	You just missed him.
Mr. Krabs	You know, you're right, SpongeBob.  We will share these magical macaroons with all the folks in Bikini Bottom. You just leave it to me.
Mr. Krabs	What did we ever do to those fortune cookies to make them lie about us like that?
Mr. Krabs	"""You will die."""
Mr. Krabs	Oh, this crowd is impossible!
Mr. Krabs	Bump.  When did food get so ugly?
Mr. Krabs	Hello, welcome to my commercial. Would you like the convenience of a Krabby Patty at home, without the hassle of going to the Krusty Krab? Well, now you can.  Have delicious Krabby Patties any time you want.  They're in your grocer's freezer section. Buy them. I want your money! Did you get that, Pearly-girl?
Mr. Krabs	Oh.
Mr. Krabs	And I've got the perfect guy for the job.
Mr. Krabs	Don.
Mr. Krabs	Well, then let's fill her up with filler!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, yeah.
Mr. Krabs	I'm rich, boy-o, rich.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no, you've made your last Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs	But I'm ready to re-hire you.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, we've got plenty of Krabby Patties right here in the freezer.
Mr. Krabs	Don't worry, Squidward. You're fired.
Mr. Krabs	Atta boy, embrace the future!
Mr. Krabs	Well, it's gone. Everything I spent me life building is all gone. I'm ruined.  What?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Fresh?
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, ooh, the flavor.  The sweet, greasy nectar of the gods. How much are you charging for these patties, boy-o?
Mr. Krabs	And how was your meal today, ma'am?
Mr. Krabs	Hold on a second! That's me cork board! It's for all me... memos.
Mr. Krabs	Step aside, boy! You're blocking me money-makin' bulletin board!
Mr. Krabs	Heh, heh, heh. Why not? And don't forget to feed your hatred with a selection from our menu!
Mr. Krabs	What?
Mr. Krabs	How about some paper?
Mr. Krabs	Nobody's orderin', son. It's that cursed cork board! I'm gonna take it down! It's nothing but trouble!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, excellent option, Mr. Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	I'll tear ya to pieces!
Mr. Krabs	No, that's today! Tomorrow is Food Con!
Mr. Krabs	As you can see gentlemen, I have spared no expense on our transportation!
Mr. Krabs	Enough!! You both are barnacles on me brain!
Mr. Krabs	Not a peep!
Mr. Krabs	Don't eat my patty!
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, good idea. Music soothes the savage beast.
Mr. Krabs	Just put in right in here. I'll even step away while you do it.
Mr. Krabs	Dig in, boys!
Mr. Krabs	You can't win Food Con if you starve to death! Now, give me that Krabby Patty boy-oh!
Mr. Krabs	Don't let him get away!
Mr. Krabs	Put your truth in, boy! We won!
Mr. Krabs	Give me your hand, boy-oh!  I need to borrow this.  Ok, I'm going in!
Mr. Krabs	Eww.  SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	I'm gonna need you to do me a big favor, laddy.
Mr. Krabs	He cannot define the hypothesis. He's a tired clown. He'll never know it's in your house!
Mr. Krabs	I don't know what you're talkin' about, Plankton! Leave me alone!
Mr. Krabs	No, please! Not that! Anything but that!
Mr. Krabs	Of course it doesn't work like that, you microscopic meathead! I took  accelerated classes and graduated months ago! This diploma is just a formality!
Mr. Krabs	Calm your waters.  Me sailor's knee says we're not in danger. See? Now, get back to work!
Mr. Krabs	Me money detector! Where do ya think you're goin'? Get back in there and spend the rest of your money!
Mr. Krabs	Pay day's been canceled! Now, hear this! I'm captain of the ship! Captain Krabs! And I say no rip current will ever harm the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs	Captain Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Um, little help here!
Mr. Krabs	Why would I want to be captain to such a sorry bunch of lubbers? I'm through!
Mr. Krabs	Not buyin' it.
Mr. Krabs	Ha! You lose!
Mr. Krabs	Alright, everybody! What am I?
Mr. Krabs	Correct! Alright, I'll save ya. But you gotta promise to spend most of your, all of your money right here! Got it?
Mr. Krabs	Well, boy-yo, you believed in me. So, today will be a pay day for you.
Mr. Krabs	Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking!  Don't worry lad, I have total confidence in you.  Put it all on Neptune!
Mr. Krabs	Can I steal a little kiss?
Mr. Krabs	Why are all my tables empty? Why am I not makin' money?
Mr. Krabs	Don't touch those! They're mint condition! Worth a fortune!
Mr. Krabs	I have some fabric leftover. So, I made this.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Arr... Uh... Hey!
Mr. Krabs	Are you sure about this? Isn't robbing a bank against the law?
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy! Anyone home? It's Captain Tightwad and Doctor Negative! We're here to rob ya! Anyone here? No.
Mr. Krabs	I'm supposed to be the villain, but why do I feel like I'm being robbed?
Mr. Krabs	All right, Krusty crew, I want to remind you all that you're representing the Krusty Krabthe greasiest greasy spoon you'll ever have the privilege of serving!
Mr. Krabs	"You trying to tell me that was a ""complement""?"
Mr. Krabs	Spread out! All right, you scurvy dogs, SpongeBob needs us, and more importantly, I need himto stop imitating me customers!
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Krabs is the best boss in the whole ocean!  Oop! Sorry, I mean  Uh
Mr. Krabs	Eh, SpongeBob. Did ya clean out the  Sweet Dutchman's ghost!  When's the last time you took a bath, boy-o? You're riddled with vermin.
Mr. Krabs	"Son, you gotta understand. I can't have you work here in your present filthy ""condisherin'."""
Mr. Krabs	Oh, come now, Mr. Squidward. Catering is a great way for you to make a little extra money. And me to make a lot!
Mr. Krabs	Why, of course they're full of germs. They're kids. Why do you think I'm wearing this full-body latex covering?
Mr. Krabs	Oof!  Don't hit nice old Mr. Krabs.  It's the piata you want, son.
Mr. Krabs	Yes!
Mr. Krabs	Indubitably, madam. We are your high-class caterers.
Mr. Krabs	Ready to serve you, Miss Money Bagser, II mean, ma'am.
Mr. Krabs	That's what I thought. Then start setting up inside.
Mr. Krabs	Great Neptune's ghost!
Mr. Krabs	Won't be seeing him again any time soon.
Mr. Krabs	Don't worry about it. Just tell me where you got them gems from.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, youget off! Enough of this!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, uh, quick, in here!
Mr. Krabs	Whoa.  This must be the place.  Hello? Ooh.
Mr. Krabs	Don't call me that! And stop jumping on that water bed! You'll pop it!
Mr. Krabs	Uh-oh.
Mr. Krabs	Nice doing business with you!
Mr. Krabs	My check!
Mr. Krabs	What? That's ridiculous. It's always been the Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs	Well, that's not true! I'm the one who made the SpongeBob PatI mean the Krabby Patty!
Mr. Krabs	Woah!
Mr. Krabs	Wait, wait! Please don't go! We're, we're having a two-for-one sale! For every two you buy, you can buy another one!  Oh! Hold on, everybody!  I think I hear SpongeBob's hideous laughter coming from the kitchen!  I'll show you that the customers are always wrong!
Mr. Krabs	Is everybody enjoying their Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs	Anyone who wants to leave has to go through  first!
Mr. Krabs	Wasting your time, boys. You should just take me straight to the morgue. I'm done.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, it's delicious.
Mr. Krabs	Huh? Hmmm. Well, I suppose I could do some bossing. How's a 99% for me and 1% for you?
Mr. Krabs	We've been shut down.
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	"Under the words, ""Krusty Krab!"""
Mr. Krabs	Why does he want to do that?
Mr. Krabs	Hooray!  Eugene H. Krabs. Go, Squidward!  Yay! Fly high! Do or die! Preferably the latter.
Mr. Krabs	They're back! They're back I tell ya! I saw it with me own eyes.  The hooks! The hooks!
Mr. Krabs	Fine, but don't say I didn't warn ya.
Mr. Krabs	Gift shops.
Mr. Krabs	I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taking a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59.  Now, what were you saying?
Mr. Krabs	The hooks! No! No! No!
Mr. Krabs	And do you know what happens when you  float back down?
Mr. Krabs	I need a sailors promise. Repeat after me: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks I'll never go.
Mr. Krabs	Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends.
Mr. Krabs	Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?
Mr. Krabs	There's only one thing to do, boy.
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward, that was some fine angling. Do you think the lad has learned his lesson?
Mr. Krabs	Gotcha!
Mr. Krabs	Gotcha!
Mr. Krabs	I'll believes it when I sees it.
Mr. Krabs	Snap your trap, boy-o! You'll blow our cover!
Mr. Krabs	You see there, lad? Plankton is up to no good! I bet those are all the fixings for another evil lab.
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, this is it, boy-o. He's got an evil laser death apparatus contraption ready to spring on all of us!
Mr. Krabs	Oh.  Good luck on your retirement, Plankton. I won't give you any more trouble.
Mr. Krabs	Get to flipping those patties fast, boy-o! Before we all become the lunch special!
Mr. Krabs	We're running out of these dancing patties! Faster, boy-o! Faster!
Mr. Krabs	Take me money!
Mr. Krabs	"Let's see, a five-letter word for happiness. ""Money."""
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, get out here!  More.  More.  All the way, boy!  What be the matter, SpongeBob? I ought to make you walk the plank for this.
Mr. Krabs	Out with it, boy!  What is it?
Mr. Krabs	That sounds like me money dropping.  What's going on out here?! My babies!  Get away, you barbarian! What have you done? Nice, clean money... soiled!  I'll take care of ya. Let papa clean ya up.  Clear the way!  No, no, no, don't cry, little ones.
Mr. Krabs	Wait.  Squidward... I'm putting you in charge of things around here while I'm gone.
Mr. Krabs	Tell me and I'll let you watch as I tear him into a thousand little pieces, mesh 'em back together, and tear him into a thousand little pieces all over again!
Mr. Krabs	Here's another batch, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	Well, okay.
Mr. Krabs	Perfect.
Mr. Krabs	Sit down, boy! There's no new spatulas!
Mr. Krabs	All right, men.  Say hello to me Pearl.
Mr. Krabs	Avast, ye shipmates! Don't these just shiver your timbers?  Get that suit on, sailor. It's already been paid for.
Mr. Krabs	Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in?
Mr. Krabs	That's it boy!
Mr. Krabs	Oh no, here it goes! I don't know if I can bear to listen.
Mr. Krabs	Oh Pearly...  Is that a 20?  Oh SpongeBob, how could I have done such a thing to me own flesh and blood?
Mr. Krabs	Ah, who needs him? I can manage this place and do SpongeBob's job with me eyes closed  and me pockets full.  Here you are, sir.  Whoa!  Sorry about that.  Oopsy.  Phew.  FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!  Okay, maybe I do need SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	"They call me ""Super Tightwad!""  Here's me bill for services and renders."
Mr. Krabs	What are you saying, Mr. Squidward? Everyone's money is good here.  At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds.
Mr. Krabs	Think of the customer.
Mr. Krabs	What's this?
Mr. Krabs	You and that bubble have been nothing but trouble! It's time to end it!
Mr. Krabs	No thanks, SpongeBob, I'm already not paying  to clean the toilets.
Mr. Krabs	You love me double patties, and the triple patty's fun. Me favorite's the patty-free patty made cheap, it's just a bun. You bought the hatty patty to cover your lack of hair, You tried the briefy patty when you needed underwear!
Mr. Krabs	Good morning, Mr. Squidward.  So, are you ready?
Mr. Krabs	Try it on, Mr. Squidward! It's got you written all over it.
Mr. Krabs	I knew you'd come around, boy. Make something nice.
Mr. Krabs	That's where you left it.
Mr. Krabs	Eleven times as a matter of fact.
Mr. Krabs	The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine.
Mr. Krabs	Plankton!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! You're scaring away me money!
Mr. Krabs	As long as you do that, the secret is safe.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Day...    I don't know the meaning of them horrible words!! Now quit your laying around SpongeBob, and take out that garbage! It's starting to give me a rash.
Mr. Krabs	Yes... why aren't you working harder?
Mr. Krabs	How could you do this, SpongeBob? Giving me secret formula to this imposter?!
Mr. Krabs	Take it easy with that thing, son.
Mr. Krabs	$2.99!
Mr. Krabs	Back you Hungry Hand, back! Help!
Mr. Krabs	I'm pumpin' it into the atmosphere, boy. Thanks to Global Warming the temperature will soon go through the roof. And then we'll have an endless summer.
Mr. Krabs	And profitable!
Mr. Krabs	The money is ready folks! The line starts here!  Where's everybody going?
Mr. Krabs	I thought I told SpongeBob to throw these moldy sponges away?
Mr. Krabs	Is he a paying customer?
Mr. Krabs	It reminds me of money.
Mr. Krabs	Hello. I like money.
Mr. Krabs	Now, before we begin with the ribbon-cutting, I'd like to announce the name of our new manager.
Mr. Krabs	A name you all know. It starts with an S.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob! You didn't get the job!
Mr. Krabs	Lad, I mean this in the nicest of ways, but there's a word for what you are, and that word is... now, let's see...
Mr. Krabs	"OK, that's enough! Look, what I'm trying to say is, you're just a kid. And to be a manager, you have to be a man. Otherwise they'd call it ""kid-ager."" You understand-ager? I mean, you understand?"
Mr. Krabs	Now, pay attention, Squidward. As new manager, you've gotta keep a sharp eye out for paying customers.
Mr. Krabs	I'm Eugene Krabs, Your Highness. Would you like to order something?
Mr. Krabs	Heh, heh.... Don't you just hate wrong numbers?
Mr. Krabs	You see? A great boss.
Mr. Krabs	No, wait! I'm begging you!
Mr. Krabs	So it's a food fight he wants, eh?
Mr. Krabs	Unleash the condiments.
Mr. Krabs	Money?!
Mr. Krabs	Well, Plankton, like a reheated Krabby Patty, you've been foiled again!
Mr. Krabs	Well, Plankton, me bunions are telling me it's time to stop gloatin'.  Eh? Looks like you're falling apart at the seams.  Huh?
Mr. Krabs	[the doors shut][starts to bang on the door]
Mr. Krabs	No. Knock-Knock.
Mr. Krabs	Jimmy BACK MY FORMULER, PLANKTON!!
Mr. Krabs	You've got to have that formuler memorized by now!
Mr. Krabs	He took  from you.
Mr. Krabs	We'd like to have a word with you.
Mr. Krabs	Let's hope so.
Mr. Krabs	Wait a minute.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!  Oh, you were like an underpaid son to me. I would have expected Squidward to stab me in the back!
Mr. Krabs	Welcome to the apocalypse, Mr. Squidward. I hope you like leather.
Mr. Krabs	Rain down? Well that's no good! How will I get me money?!
Mr. Krabs	That's okay, SpongeBob. We'll just have to sacrifice the two of you then! Prepare them for the sacrifice!
Mr. Krabs	That's right. Keep thinking happy thoughts. Now!  The boy's right.
Mr. Krabs	No way, Squidward.  You're going up there with us.
Mr. Krabs	I have a bad feeling about this.
Mr. Krabs	Put your back into it!
Mr. Krabs	Book?
Mr. Krabs	Here. Take Squidward, you vile beasts!
Mr. Krabs	Ah-ah-achoo!  36 days without a customer.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! Bring this guy some grub before he keels over!
Mr. Krabs	No one goes to a restaurant for atmosphere. They go for food!
Mr. Krabs	What am I going to do? If I don't think of an idea, I'll go out of business!
Mr. Krabs	What in the name of money are you waiting for, boy? Tell me!
Mr. Krabs	Don't that look appetizing?
Mr. Krabs	Pretty Patties?
Mr. Krabs	I've got to see this for me self!
Mr. Krabs	They sure are, boy. You're doing pretty well for yourself. I guess you've completely forgotten the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs	Don't worry, lad. I'll watch the stand for ye.
Mr. Krabs	Run to her, boy. She's waiting for ya.
Mr. Krabs	I'm ready! I'm ready! For me money.  Welcome to Pretty Patties! May I take your money?
Mr. Krabs	My key! Where's my key? SpongeBob! Let me in! SpongeBob! Let me in! SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Nickel buddy, I'll never spend you!
Mr. Krabs	Careful!
Mr. Krabs	...on my Dear Aunt Sally's false teeth.
Mr. Krabs	NOOOOOOOO...!!!
Mr. Krabs	What do you mean?
Mr. Krabs	No.
Mr. Krabs	Well, uh, it's
Mr. Krabs	That one was a gift!  Listen, all that stuff is, uh... borrowed.
Mr. Krabs	See you later!  Oh, that was a close one.
Mr. Krabs	Okay boy, my demands, uhh, I mean, my letter, is ready to go.
Mr. Krabs	Here's a special something to you from me!
Mr. Krabs	That was fantastic, boy. You really knocked them out! I think I'll do this joke night thing again with you as the head-liner!
Mr. Krabs	Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants.
Mr. Krabs	Neptune preserve her!
Mr. Krabs	Well, um... we're late for our...
Mr. Krabs	Once you get your land legs it's not so bad!
Mr. Krabs	Hip hip!
Mr. Krabs	But it's free day!
Mr. Krabs	Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom!  Why, I've been taking him to the cleaners every Thursday night for fifteen years!  I never lose!
Mr. Krabs	I lost...
Mr. Krabs	I'm afraid you don't work here anymore.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!  Can I have my arms back?
Mr. Krabs	I would trade it all away, if you'd come back to stay.
Mr. Krabs	Um...Well...  a deal's a deal, Plankton. He's your headache now.
Mr. Krabs	Glad to have you back, lad. Now get to those patties! The lunch rush is a-comin'!
Mr. Krabs	Oh I'll let you go, squirt. On a flying saucer!  Back to the Chum Bucket with you!
Mr. Krabs	Not to mention free refreshments.
Mr. Krabs	Well, these claws ain't for just attractin' mates.
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward,  welcome to the night shift. From now on, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours a day.
Mr. Krabs	Doesn't matter? It's money that makes the world go round, boy! It's money that keeps your pants square!  It's money that keeps Squidward in frilly soap!
Mr. Krabs	Mrs. Puff? Aw... she's married.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no, no, no, I, I'm, I'm too old, boy. Too hard-shelled for love. Besides, I ain't not properly dressed.
Mr. Krabs	No!
Mr. Krabs	No!  Gla-goo, meep bo blargh uh hee!
Mr. Krabs	Aye. What do you say?
Mr. Krabs	Check!
Mr. Krabs	Who's that?
Mr. Krabs	Nothing's too good for you, my prickly peach.
Mr. Krabs	What? $100?! Well, this can't possibly be correct!
Mr. Krabs	Perhaps there is, boy!  I'm puttin' you in charge of me money!
Mr. Krabs	Good boy! You'll do fine!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, you can't call on a classy lady like Mrs. Puff empty-handed! We ain't talking about this...  ...or this...  ...we're talking about this!
Mr. Krabs	Uh... you did. He'll be right back. He's our personal assistant for the day.
Mr. Krabs	We had an agreement, boy! You ain't supposed to spend any of me money!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, you can't go to Mrs. Puff's house without chocolates! Hurry! Hurry!
Mr. Krabs	Mrs. Puff needs a sun hat, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Today! Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! I'll save you!
Mr. Krabs	Didn't need to buy one?  You hear that, boy?  We didn't need to buy a hat.  Aren't you supposed saving me money!?
Mr. Krabs	You're spending all me money!  Puffy needs a new pair of shoes!
Mr. Krabs	But lad, this time's different! Mrs. Puff needs this!
Mr. Krabs	Lad, I can't help it if you're loose with other people's money.  Do you think Mrs. Puff will need a dryer to go along with that?
Mr. Krabs	Well, it's the worst time of the day once again.  Closing time!
Mr. Krabs	Well, what was it? What'd he say?
Mr. Krabs	Yes, that one! Now quit saying that! It's a bad word!
Mr. Krabs	OK, boys. I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again.
Mr. Krabs	Out with it, boy!
Mr. Krabs	Now I'm gonna let go of yer lips, and when I do, I want you to calmly tell me what youse need to tell me, understand?
Mr. Krabs	...a whole lotta  and with a side of , a heapin' helpin' of  and a boatload of  ...
Mr. Krabs	Oh, dear Mother! What have these foul-mouthed heathens done to you?  You two should be ashamed! Making an old lady faint with your sailor talk!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, who's playing Squidward's records again?
Mr. Krabs	Well, keep dreaming.  This'll be on your time.
Mr. Krabs	Then go out there and get me some more jellies!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, that'll never do. More!
Mr. Krabs	More!  More!  More!  More!  More...  More!  More, more, more, more! More, more! More!
Mr. Krabs	Easy boy, what are you doing with that?
Mr. Krabs	"Well, you can't. The door's voice-activated and will only open if I say ""open""."
Mr. Krabs	And all that free publicity will bring in customers! So don't lose!
Mr. Krabs	That's what you think, but I got me a champion. SpongeBob! Show him!
Mr. Krabs	He's gonna stab you in the back.
Mr. Krabs	And win...
Mr. Krabs	Don't forget, he called ye yellow.
Mr. Krabs	What?! Profits down three dollars from last month! I got to start running a tighter ship around here!
Mr. Krabs	Hmm? SpongeBob! I ain't paying you to play dress up!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, sorry, that's me dry cleaning.  Here's your check.
Mr. Krabs	A strike?
Mr. Krabs	And you're going to demand me respect?
Mr. Krabs	See what I mean? Squidward, please, you got to come back.
Mr. Krabs	Well, Squidward, those were intense negotiations.
Mr. Krabs	In order to pay off these damages, you two are going to work for me forever!
Mr. Krabs	In the back.
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, ooh, sweet wampum. Huh! Whazzat?  Squidward, where are you? Shield me with your forehead!  So, it was a just another failed Krabby Patty theft attempt by my arch competitor, Plankton!  For a second there, I mistook you for a threat. But you're just a dirty little man.  So long, shrimp!
Mr. Krabs	Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar!  Aw, ya got me! Well, at least it's underwire. Here's your stinkin' Patty!
Mr. Krabs	And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...
Mr. Krabs	It's either you or Mystery.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!  What was that? Is that horse in here?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what's the meaning of all these nicknames? Davey H Jones!
Mr. Krabs	I was five years old and me father gave me a dollar. I loved that dollar. Loved it like a brother. Me and that dollar went everywhere together.
Mr. Krabs	It's ok, son. You did the proper thing. She's free now and we have no right to separate that wild animal from her natural habitat.
Mr. Krabs	You really haven't got any brains at all, have you, son?  Just go out there and give him what he needs. Pour on the charm. Sweet talk him.
Mr. Krabs	The Buttered Barnacles are a touch of heaven.
Mr. Krabs	Do you know what this means, dear boy? We're in the clear!
Mr. Krabs	Bamboozled!
Mr. Krabs	Ohh, hold on, I've got a ton of toenail clippings in my office!
Mr. Krabs	I don't think he'll be laughin', boy.
Mr. Krabs	Well, you could've talked me out of it!
Mr. Krabs	What's the holdup down there?
Mr. Krabs	His head's stickin' out!
Mr. Krabs	Listen here, ya little barnacle. No one, and I mean no one, can ever know about this. It'll be the end of you, it'll be the end of me, and worst of all, it'll be the end of me.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, listen carefully. We're just getting a lift back to the Krusty Krab. I need you to stay calm and don't lose your cool. Understand.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, he gets carsick real easy.
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy there, SpongeBob! I thought you were out back taking care of that shovel!
Mr. Krabs	Here's your soda! Always a pleasure to serve the folks in blue. Well, goodbye now!
Mr. Krabs	Ok, I confess!  SpongeBob killed him!
Mr. Krabs	Wait! It's not what you think!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah...a joke!
Mr. Krabs	Open for business.  See anything you like?
Mr. Krabs	Ok, Mr. Bargain Hunter, five bucks.
Mr. Krabs	That ain't no toilet plunger! This here's an antique! It's, um... uh...  ...a 17th-century soup ladle, see?
Mr. Krabs	That's right, SpongeBob, and you're one of 'em.
Mr. Krabs	With 10 dollars.
Mr. Krabs	Don't mention it, boys.  What a couple of rubes.
Mr. Krabs	Fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-...
Mr. Krabs	Oh, never mind that. Listen, I didn't want to say this in front of Patrick, but that hat makes you look like a girl.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! Just the man I wanted to see. Still playing with that dumb old hat, eh?
Mr. Krabs	Not even a teensy-tiny bit?
Mr. Krabs	The juicer.
Mr. Krabs	I'm not a shopping list...  I'm a ghost.
Mr. Krabs	Yes. It must belonged to some guy who's dead now.
Mr. Krabs	Number one in Bogeyland! Now, listen, a curse will descend on you unless you return that hat to its owner immediately.
Mr. Krabs	Yes, yes! It must be returned to its owner, right now.
Mr. Krabs	How did? I just... You did... I did... Gimme that shovel.
Mr. Krabs	No, no, no!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, right. You and what army?
Mr. Krabs	Tallyho!  Look at me, I'm Errol Fin!  You're falling apart, marrow brain. You must be kidding.  Back to oblivion.  Oh, ho. How's your sister? All right, boneheads, playtime's over.  Wa-ha! A million dollars. I've got a million dollars!  Oh, there you are. Well, I got it. The rare novelty soda-drinking hat. Let's start the bidding at one million dollars.
Mr. Krabs	No, I got Squidward organizing the whole thing. He's... ya know... artsy. What the...? This looks expensive. Out of my way. Coming through. Move it or lose it. Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Then what's all this useless junk?
Mr. Krabs	All right, get lost, all of ya. You're fired. Go on. Scram. Get out of here, you moochers. That's right, keep moving. Except you. You stay.
Mr. Krabs	Quit fooling and come on out. I need you to be in the commercial.
Mr. Krabs	That's right, Amy. I heard all about your little problem and I'm here to help. Follow... me!
Mr. Krabs	Why, it's only the most mouthwatering appetizing food in the seven seas.
Mr. Krabs	Two more satisfied customers. So why don't you come on in, and have yourself a Krabby Patty today.
Mr. Krabs	So, if I fire him and make his successor do twice the work, and...  ...eh, come in.  Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob. Those heads better be beautiful.
Mr. Krabs	Boy, those Krabby fumes must've gotten to your head. Borrow Squidward's gas mask and get right back to work.
Mr. Krabs	51, 52, 53...
Mr. Krabs	My dime! Me special dime! The first dime I ever made! I always keep it in the back of the register for luck!
Mr. Krabs	Heavens to Betsy, no. It's just that me lucky dime's gone missin', and you've been working the register all day!
Mr. Krabs	I wanna see empty suction cups.
Mr. Krabs	Wrong. That ain't me first dime.
Mr. Krabs	I've been in business a long time, boy.
Mr. Krabs	It's all water under the bridge now.
Mr. Krabs	Well, the way I see it there are three possibilities: One, you put the dime in me pants; Two, you put the dime in me pants; or Three, you put the dime in me pants!
Mr. Krabs	I know. This really  the world's smallest violin.  See?
Mr. Krabs	Aye-aye!
Mr. Krabs	Did I say that? No, I cleaned the bathrooms on the Gourmet. I was the head chef on the S.S. Diarrhea.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad. I love this young people's music.
Mr. Krabs	Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again.
Mr. Krabs	What is it, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Why?
Mr. Krabs	Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break! Now get back to work!
Mr. Krabs	Aw, me radio died!  Hmmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas.  Me hard-boiled egg is ready!  I can already taste it. Come to Papa.  Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, hello, boys.  What can I do for you?  Heh-heh, why did you lock the door?  Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?!  SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!
Mr. Krabs	I'm Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs	What?!  You think I'm a robot?!
Mr. Krabs	No, wait! What are you going to do with me blender?! That cost me money!
Mr. Krabs	No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator.  No!
Mr. Krabs	Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Listen, instead of killing yourselves, I've got something real important for you to do for me.  Now, are you men ready for your Super...?
Mr. Krabs	Assignment?
Mr. Krabs	What the?
Mr. Krabs	Sorry? You dusted all my knickknacks! That was really nice. Great Barrier Reef!! what's this?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what are you doing?
Mr. Krabs	And then did you draw on it with crayon?!?
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, I lied. This paint actually comes off with saliva!
Mr. Krabs	Shoes...
Mr. Krabs	I don't value you at all!
Mr. Krabs	Never noticed it.
Mr. Krabs	No! Come back! Aw, thanks a lot, you air-breathing charlatan! And you can forget about these free condiments too!
Mr. Krabs	Well, all my loyal customers, of course!
Mr. Krabs	Ooh. Neptune's trousers, Squidward! Maybe you should just lay off the broccoli for a while.
Mr. Krabs	Four and a half patties in one minute! Well McNulty can eat a hundred in a minute! But you know I think your teeth might be getting in the way a little bit-
Mr. Krabs	What the devil fish is going on out here?! Time is money! And if you boys is wasting time, then you're wasting money!  And that's just sick!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	I'm losing money on this deal!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, you're playing with fire now, Plankton!
Mr. Krabs	You go first, boy.
Narrator	Oh no, you've got a lot to learn before you're ready to make a Krabby Patty. As you can see by this graph...  Graph.  You have been employed in one of the most successful restaurants in Bikini Bottom. But it didn't that way over night...  ...because the store closes at 6:00.  No, the story of the Krusty Krab is the story of one man's hard work, perseverance, vision, determination and sweat.  But mostly his sweat.  From Humble Beginnings.  You may think that Mr. Eugene H. Krabs, owner and founder of Krusty Krab Inc., has always been the financial wizard he is today.  And you're right!  After the war, Krabs stayed secluded in a deep depression that seemed endless.  But then his luck changed when he acquired a bankrupt retirement home and with a few minor alterations, the Krusty Krab was born.  Sounds like a lot of...
Narrator	Sounds like a lot of hoopla to make over a little Krabby Patty right?  Wrong!  The Krusty Krab today.  To keep up with today's demanding customers, no expense has been spared to acquire all the latest achievements in fast-food technology.
Narrator	No, you can't make a Krabby Patty without understanding the phrase POOP.
Narrator	Do you think he's going to order: A: A sofa, B: An expensive haircut, or C: A patty?
Narrator	Whoa there! We have a few more topics to cover first.  Your Work Station.  It's important to keep your area tidy and free of droppings. But a clean workstation is only part of the job.  To make the vision in your head a reality, you'll need supplies. And a good employee always keeps his supplies well-organized.  Very nice Mr. SquarePants, not a pickle out of place.  Now let's see how Squidward keeps his work station.
Narrator	"Now we go from behind the scenes to the front lines, where we'll examine the most important aspect of the industry, the customer. Or as we like to say, the ""Krustomer""."
Narrator	We'll check up on these two later.  Right now, it's important that we discuss an emergency situation!  Like the lost gold of Atlantis, many consider the Krabby Patty to be a treasure. And as with every treasure, there's a thief ready to steal it. So it's up to you to be the watchful eyes of...  What's this?  It's Mr. Krabs business rival, Plankton!
Narrator	Just remember POOP.
Narrator	Now live, from Encino, California, get ready for a warm embrace from our party host, Patchy the Pirate!
Narrator	(television version only) That includes you folks, SpongeBob's House Party will be right back after these messages.   Ahoy there! Welcome back to SpongeBob's House Party!
Narrator	A call that would normally be answered by Bikini Bottom's semi-retired champions.  they weren't the ones causing the problem.
Narrator	The Elastic Waistband...able to stretch his body into fantastic shapes and forms!
Narrator	It's time for another SpongeBob SquarePants special! But it's not an ordinary special,  because today we go to Encino, California, as it was  one hundred million years ago! So prepare yourself for  SpongeBob SquarePants B.C.!  With your host, Patchy the Pirate!
Narrator	Hooray! It looks like our prehistoric pals have just discovered fire, but they will soon learn that when you play with fire, you may get burned. Stay tuned.
Narrator	When we last saw our hungry troglodytes, they just discovered fire. How long will it take for them to mess it up? Let's see.
Narrator	The next day.
Narrator	Several bad puns later.
Narrator	It's Mermaid Man! Savior of the deep!  And his young fit servant, Barnacle Boy.
Narrator	Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Where diligent students learn the rules of the road.
Narrator	It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom.
Narrator	Ah, Jellyfish Fields. Here we find SpongeBob once again stalking the wild jellyfish. SpongeBob? Hello? SpongeBob? Hmmm... he's supposed to be here somewhere...  A-ha!
Narrator	8 hours later...
Narrator	"""Boat Smarts with Mrs. Puff"". This driving film is brought to you by: C.O.B.B.U.T.K.S.B.S.P.O.T.R.A.O.O.B.A.T. Citizens Of Bikini Bottom United To Keep SpongeBob SquarePants Off The Road And Out Of Boats All Together."
Narrator	Wow, it's a deep-fry patty cookin' machine.  And hiding behind it, who do we see? None other than Squidward and his bad face acne.
Narrator	Quick as a flash, Squidward pulled the big lever, and sat back and watched feeling oh, so quite clever. SpongeBob, with spatula held tight in his fist, flung twenty patties, not a single one missed.
Narrator	He took in some air. SpongeBob swelled his physique. And dozens of patties filled up his cheeks.  He strained and he sweated. He summoned his will, and shot Krabby Patties right onto the grill.
Narrator	Sandy said...
Narrator	He struggled and strained 'til his face turned dark blue. Then the lever moved forward and broke right in two. The gadget buckled and sparked. It cracked like a gun. So Squidward took off, yelling...
Narrator	"It was all over, finished and done. With his head held up high, SpongeBob knew he had won. The crowd yelled, ""Hooray, Squidward's name is now mud!"" But as they were cheering, SpongeBob fell with a thud.  The service was short, tears shed with regret. Squidward, it seemed, was the one most upset."
Narrator	The Next Day--
Narrator	Much, much, much later.
Narrator	three days later
Narrator	7:59 a.m.
Narrator	Two hours later.
Narrator	There appears to be a Krabby Patty napping in progress!  There can only be one culprit: Plankton!
Narrator	8 Hours Later...
Narrator	... well... to them, it's like eating an ice cream cone... on a cold day. Sometimes, in surfing, it's the approach that's most important.
Narrator	... or he stands to miss the ride of his life.
Narrator	You just enjoyed another exciting episode of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Brought to you by...  ...the new Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy book!

Narrator	And now, Patrick Star checks his Instaclam.
Narrator	Ah, beautiful springtime. A time for fun and frolic for most...  but not for this poor slob.
Narrator	You know you are from Bikini Bottom when... this crimefighting duo protects your city from evil.
Narrator	But how do you know you are from Bikini Bottom? You live in a pineapple under the sea!
Narrator	Even you.
Narrator	What if SpongeBob was gone?
Narrator	What if SpongeBob was gone?
Narrator	It's SpongeBob's Legendary Dance Party!
Narrator	What if the mystery ended this way?
Narrator	Ah, the Krusty Krab. Home of the Krabby Patty, with its top secret formula, known only to those who are brave enough and intelligent enough to comprehend its culinary complexity.
Narrator	Ah, Goo Lagoon. A stinky mud puddle to you and me. But to the inhabitants of Bikini Bottom, a wonderful, stinky mud puddle.
Narrator	Isn't it about time Squidward got his own show? Probably not. But, if he did, the opening theme song might sound a little something like this...
Narrator	Let's try together. Patrick, is tomorrow going to be a good day?
Narrator	There's your answer. But before another question, ask Pat!
Narrator	Umm, Patrick, wanna try that again?
Narrator	Bikini Bottom's 7 Life Strategies are here! Act now and you can put into practice these crucial techniques for spongier, squarer, and more absorbent living!

Narrator	And that's your exclusive look at SpongeBob and Rough Draft Studios.
Narrator	Here we are again at the Bikini Bottom Boating School. Today is once again the day of SpongeBob's boating school exam. But more importantly, this is the last test for the year,  and if SpongeBob does not pass this one, it means  another whole year of boating school!

Narrator	Ah, The Goo Lagoon. Where the sun is hot and the sunbathers are oh so cool.
Narrator	Three days later...
Narrator	Well, that's the story. Yes, they are all idiots, aren't they?
Narrator	Ah, observe the majesty of the mighty iceberg.  This frozen giant, normally found floating in polar regions, can sometimes  stray into warmer waters, causing dramatic changes in climate  for tropical, undersea life.

Narrator	2 hours later...
Narrator	Twenty-Four hours later....
Narrator	Many Tic-Tacs later...
Narrator	The very next evening...
Narrator	And so, SpongeBob and Patrick begin their narrowing task.  Tell it to the wagon, not just by ropes, but by their own foolish mistakes. Onward, they trench.
Narrator	You will notice that the sponge is bored, because his best friend Patrick is away.
Narrator	See? What did I tell you?
Narrator	Moments later...
Narrator	Ahh. Graduation Day.
Narrator	Soon after...
Narrator	Later...
Narrator	82 kilometers later...
Narrator	This has been a word from Jellyfishing Fields State Park.
Narrator	Hey, wait a minute. What is happening?
Narrator	The artist has learned the first lesson of the sea: Always bring a spare pencil.
Narrator	Ah, The Krusty Krab. Bikini Bottom's premiere daytime eatery. Where it will be closing time right about...
Narrator	"Ah, a yard sale. You know the old saying: ""One man's trash is another man's treasure."""
Patrick	Where do you think you're going?
Patrick	Who made a spatula out of toothpicks in wood shop?
Patrick	Who's ready?
Patrick	One Krabby Patty, please.
Patrick	Uhh... I'll have an uhh... uhh... uhh... ah...  Huh? What's that?
Patrick	Great idea, Squidward! One Krabby Patty, please.
Patrick	Sure?
Patrick	It's been very mild, yes.
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	Yeah. Knock, knock.
Patrick	You wanna talk to SpongeNob?
Patrick	Thanks.  Here you go, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Yeah! Whatever you did, you should write it down and do it again next weekend. Thanks again, SpongeBob. See ya!
Patrick	Is that gonna hurt?
Patrick	Make way for a couple of ontre-prenyouers!
Patrick	Hm... I got it! Let's get naked!
Patrick	Oh, okay.
Patrick	Hee hee, it tickles!
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	Nice place you got in here.
Patrick	Not the way I use them!
Patrick	You rub it on your skin and it makes you live forever.
Patrick	You'll fall in love!
Patrick	I can live with that.
Patrick	But what are we going to spend it on?
Patrick	The whose abouts of what?
Patrick	I'll save you, Quickster, ahh!
Patrick	Wait for you to get back!
Patrick	And no line!
Patrick	6:20? But I thought you said you were late.
Patrick	Ohhh!
Patrick	Who said that?  Was it him?
Patrick	Sorry.
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	Why are they laughing?
Patrick	What?
Patrick	Sure thing, buddy.
Patrick	Psst, SpongeBob!  Psst, SpongeBob!  SpongeBob?  SpongeBob? Psst, over here. I'm trying to tell you something. Something important.
Patrick	Who cares about a stupid star?
Patrick	Well, don't mind if I do!
Patrick	Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you.
Patrick	Ohhhhh...!
Patrick	Ahh. Light bulb!  But why does it have to be so far away?  I'm coming, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Poor guy.  Hey, check out Squidward's new snail.
Patrick	Hmmm, 'Property of Squidward Tentpoles.'
Patrick	Hey SpongeBob, check out my new snail.
Patrick	Yeah, thanks. I know. He's got nerves of steel.
Patrick	Good one, Squidward.
Patrick	It's okay, Rocky. You go when you feel like it.
Patrick	Yeah, it's gonna rock!
Patrick	Party!
Patrick	I don't know, SpongeBob. He might cramp our style.
Patrick	Fine, and you? All right, you're in. But I'm not happy about it.
Patrick	Let's party!
Patrick	I'm feeling it, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	Is it time already to ruin Squid's day?  Hey, SpongeBob, don't start without me!
Patrick	No, wait a minute, no you don't.  We can build you a new house!
Patrick	We're done!
Patrick	Tartar sauce.
Patrick	Spiders! Spiders! Spiders!
Patrick	Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Patrick	Do it again! I wasn't looking!
Patrick	Or your other armpit!
Patrick	Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever?!
Patrick	And that's when I punch him, right?
Patrick	Ice cream!
Patrick	Washing an old person!
Patrick	Yeah, it's all crushy-looking.
Patrick	Patrick to SpongeBob. Patrick to SpongeBob. Do you read me? Over.
Patrick	Pretty weenie!
Patrick	SONG! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E...
Patrick	Flashlights are their natural prey.
Patrick	Or a hoop skirt.
Patrick	SpongeBob, what are we gonna do? A sea bear's sure to come and eat us!
Patrick	Pretend to be somebody else!
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over. They're special!
Patrick	What?
Patrick	I won't.
Patrick	Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?
Patrick	That is the stench of discovery. Come on, buddy. I'll give you a boost.  Hop on, pal.
Patrick	Okay.
Patrick	Here, let me get that. Hey, look! A Stingray 5000 single. Hey, these guys rock. Why would anybody throw this away?
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob...
Patrick	There it is!
Patrick	Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards.
Patrick	Well, it's like my grandpa used to say.
Patrick	Ready!
Patrick	Okay!
Patrick	[While beginning to cry] Seanut Brittle?
Patrick	I don't get it.
Patrick	That's the ultimate prank! Good idea, SpongeBob!
Patrick	I think since spraying the park bench was my idea, I should get to spray it.
Patrick	I gotta  it to you, SpongeBob. You look kinda funny.
Patrick	Hey, I think I found our pants.  Oops! Here, these are yours.
Patrick	Don't mention what?
Patrick	Lay it on me.
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	We got him good, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	Donuts.
Patrick	What would the real Mermaid Man do?
Patrick	Ooh! Pretty lights!
Patrick	It's working.
Patrick	Yeah, we did it.
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	I thought it was your idea.
Patrick	I knew it!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, isn't that the mattress over there?
Patrick	Gee, thanks buddy.
Patrick	Let's do it again.
Patrick	Uhh, SpongeBob?
Patrick	See if he plays catch.
Patrick	Trick or treat.
Patrick	How is Gary?
Patrick	SpongeBob, is that you?
Patrick	Snap out of it.
Patrick	Because... many years ago, I took that challenge.
Patrick	Thanks, buddy.
Patrick	Hmmm... well...  Yeah, it's about a week, maybe ten days.
Patrick	I only tasted six types of sediment.
Patrick	There's one place we haven't checked.
Patrick	What do you mean? You drove him away. It's right there in black and white. See? Right there and there.
Patrick	Hey, their having a sale on scented pine cones.
Patrick	Once again, you and I are kept apart, oh sweet scented pine cones. Hey, Gary.  Um...uhh...
Patrick	Did you just say Gary? SpongeBob, I just remembered earlier today at the craft store, I saw... these huge chunks of balsa wood! [SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears] They were awesome!
Patrick	No, silly. Not the president of Bikini Bottom. Even better.
Patrick	Hold still, buddy.
Patrick	Did you find him, SpongeBob?
Patrick	I say he checks out a-ok!
Patrick	Nope.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, how's it going?
Patrick	Right foot first...
Patrick	What happened?
Patrick	So they cut it out.
Patrick	Right behind ya, SpongeBob.
Patrick	SpongeBob, help!
Patrick	What's that?
Patrick	I'm not sure that there's anything I can add at this point.
Patrick	Look out trouble!
Patrick	Ooh!
Patrick	I'm right here and I don't believe it.
Patrick	Huh? No! No! No-o-o! The horror. The horror.
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	Why don't we just make our own movie?
Patrick	"Yeah, yeah. Ooh! I got one! ""Adventures in the Underground City""."
Patrick	And they have an adventure...
Patrick	Yeah, and then he...umm...he drinks...cheese coffee.
Patrick	Yeah, I got the footage.
Patrick	Yup, I didn't want to lose it so I put it there right before we started filming.
Patrick	The rest of me is up here.
Patrick	Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding.
Patrick	Yes, quite.
Patrick	Doesn't feel like fun.
Patrick	Sometimes I just need to get away from it all.  Wow, this hotel has everything!
Patrick	I'll need some help with my bags.
Patrick	I don't tell you how to live  life!
Patrick	Hold on a second, SpongeBob.  Here you are, my good man.
Patrick	Peel it.
Patrick	I need you to eat these Krabby Patties with me.
Patrick	Hooray!
Patrick	This is a hospital?
Patrick	The nerve of some people.
Patrick	Oh, sorry.
Patrick	What'll we do?
Patrick	Right!  I made an invention. It's a stick you can draw or write stuff with.
Patrick	Somebody keeps stealing my ideas!
Patrick	You guys talk funny. Say more words!
Patrick	Doctor Professor Patrick. Don't mind him. You know how interns are.
Patrick	Good idea.
Patrick	As sure as I'm a doctor professor.
Patrick	It's okay. The horrible screaming means that it's working!
Patrick	Sorry.
Patrick	How do you know my name?
Patrick	But I got my wish.
Patrick	Tag, you're it.
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	Hi, Squidward.
Patrick	Tag, you're it.
Patrick	What does claustrophobic mean?
Patrick	Darn.
Patrick	Oh, you mean like this?
Patrick	My ice cream! It's alive!
Patrick	Hehe, you look funny! Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	I wanna be good!
Patrick	Hello, brothers.
Patrick	Horrible!
Patrick	I wanna go home!
Patrick	At the intersection of Conch and Coral.
Patrick	Well, let's not forget the worst of them all: Mad Snail Disease.
Patrick	This disease will ravage your body with bloodshot eyes, loss of balance, messy pants, ticklish rib cage, severely untrimmed toenails, and finally, the bite from that infected snail will turn you into... a zombie.
Patrick	Or is it?
Patrick	You're right.  I'm a zombie!
Patrick	Good morning, boss. I'm ready for my first day.
Patrick	Wow.  Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher.  Wow. It scratches backs, too!
Patrick	It talks!
Patrick	SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh!
Patrick	Oh, sorry.
Patrick	A wig?  Oh, boy. Don't you think that's a little silly?  Oh, man, it's time for my weekly condiment soak.  Do you mind?
Patrick	Don't be sad, SpongeBob. You can borrow one of mine.  Just wash it before you return it.
Patrick	What are you doing?
Patrick	"Hmm.  ""Shrink."" I do have a lot of issues."
Patrick	That's silly. Don't you think it's more likely that the entire world grew?
Patrick	I thought this place was in bad shape.
Patrick	Like this!
Patrick	SpongeBob, do what you were born to do! Dance!
Patrick	Uh, me?
Patrick	Uhh, well, uhh... hmmm, I'm not sure. But he had a briefcase.
Patrick	My peanut butter!
Patrick	I'm sorry, there's no stopping the unstoppable. Patrick Star will live no more, forever... in Bikini Bottom.
Patrick	Yeah, well, thanks ol' SpongeBob for your help. It was a noble effort but alas, all in vain, it's no use. I must leave.  Goodbye rock. Goodbye coral.  YOW!  Goodbye seaweed.
Patrick	D'oh!
Patrick	Do it again. Do it again.
Patrick	Could you turn it up?
Patrick	Squidward?
Patrick	Oh wait, I think I've seen this before. This part's funny.
Patrick	And some kibble.
Patrick	No, no, Smelly. Squidward doesn't like pets.  Hey, Smelly, wanna play catch?  Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.  Almost.  Again.  So close.  Yeah, now you're...  Smelly! What's gotten into you?!  Hello, Animal Control? There's a wild animal loose in my house.  Sure, I'll hold.  Smelly! Come back. Smelly!
Patrick	Mmm, good plan.
Patrick	I'll let Smelly go first.
Patrick	I'm going to miss him, SpongeBob. Me, too, buddy. Me, too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong.
Patrick	Did you say frozen dessert?
Patrick	But he's so tasty!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, there's a guy over here talking into a tubey thing.
Patrick	Hey SpongeBob? I'm still hungry. Can you turn me into a jar of mayonnaise so I can eat myself?
Patrick	Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone.
Patrick	Who's a winner?
Patrick	Are they gonna mail it to you?
Patrick	Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing.
Patrick	I passed my test!
Patrick	How do I look?
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	The horn works.  Whoo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?
Patrick	I try to serve as an inspiration to others.
Patrick	I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep.
Patrick	Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life.
Patrick	No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license.
Patrick	Boy, driving is so easy.
Patrick	Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy.
Patrick	Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides.
Patrick	What? Where? Who?
Patrick	They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?
Patrick	Litterbug?! No!
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	How's that?
Patrick	I know exactly who you are!
Patrick	I'll show you why.  See him? He's from the library. He knows about my overdue books.  Uh-huh. Which means I'm gonna get thrown into the big house. And you know what that means...
Patrick	What is?
Patrick	King needs food badly.
Patrick	Uh-huh, that sounds great. Hey, can I get a little more ketchup?
Patrick	I want it.
Patrick	Good! Now tell him.
Patrick	Yeah, well, now you can spend the rest of your life crying about it. I'm the king!
Patrick	I need your opinion on something. Do you think the giant flat-screen TV should go over the fancy egg display or the indoor swimming pool?
Patrick	Uh...
Patrick	I don't know what you mean.
Patrick	[explodes] Who's saying I'm abusing my POWER!?!  I'll put the whole town in prison!  Questioning my authority is treason! All these kingly speeches are making me thirsty. SpongeBob, I request a drink. SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?! Huh. Gee, everybody's gone. I'm all alone. Fine, I'll get it myself!
Patrick	No. Uh-uh.
Patrick	Huh.
Patrick	Hide me!
Patrick	Me!
Patrick	If we dressed up like that then we'd be the big, scary bikers and they'd be little baby doody-heads.
Patrick	See?
Patrick	What about our biker club?
Patrick	Well, I didn't catch a thing with my dumb old net.
Patrick	I'm all done.
Patrick	SpongeBob, I found your net!
Patrick	No.
Patrick	Um, I did something recently I'm not very proud of. I didn't mean to do it. It just sort of happened.
Patrick	Ahh! I accidentally knocked SpongeBob's toothbrush in the toilet and put it back on the counter without washing it! Confess-A-Bear?  You're mad at me, aren't you, Confess-A-Bear?
Patrick	Hello.
Patrick	Ok, bye.
Patrick	Eh, nothing.
Patrick	Nothing. I just finished.  Oh, hey, look. You can see where I was just standing from here. Boy, if you wanted to, you could have spied on me all day from right here.  Creepy, huh? Anyway, what are you doing with those binoculars?
Patrick	Oh. No.
Patrick	You can't have it for any price.
Patrick	Why, SpongeBob, why? Why would you wear such a scary mustache?
Patrick	Gift.
Patrick	I'm leaving Bikini Bottom while I still have my dignity.
Patrick	I'm staying in Bikini Bottom!
Patrick	D'oh, hold it, SpongeBob. Ooh, I know. You shaved your beard.
Patrick	SpongeBob, I broke... could I use this one?
Patrick	Don't let those sour notes bring you down.
Patrick	What's wrong, buddy?
Patrick	Oh, SpongeBob, you don't mind if I say good-bye to Gummy, do you?
Patrick	What? Is that true?
Patrick	SpongeBob, what are you doing? I'm waiting.
Patrick	What's this? SpongeBob, what have you done?
Patrick	Aw, just come right out and...  Will you stop? Just stop.
Patrick	Yes!
Patrick	Oh!
Patrick	Hi, Squidward!
Patrick	Quick! Turn it on, SpongeBob!  More lights!  Now, SpongeBob! More lights!
Patrick	Huh? SpongeBob, there's a really big light! I'll go get it, buddy!
Patrick	Oh my gosh.  I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!  I gotta put on my teeth and brush my pants!  Gary?  Pants then flies through the bathroom, coming out with a toothbrush][the toothpaste flies off the toothbrush][Patrick bounces off the side, onto the roof, the bathtub, and out of his rock where SpongeBob is waiting]
Patrick	Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something.
Patrick	Look how big it is, SpongeBob!
Patrick	I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on!  Holy seacow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room.
Patrick	I don't know!  But let's see what this does!
Patrick	Oh, wait, I think this one starts it.
Patrick	Hey! Whoa! Somebody get me down, or up, or something!  Hey, SpongeBob, watch this!
Patrick	Wow, it sure looks a lot like home.  Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!
Patrick	Alien hunting! Alien hunting!
Patrick	Pardon my French but get this thing off me!
Patrick	SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip.
Patrick	Oh, but it's not you that's got me, it's...  ...me that's got me!
Patrick	I love toys! Can I wait for your toy with you?
Patrick	Let's go down to the Krusty Krab for a Krabby Patty.
Patrick	Hey, buddy.
Patrick	Yeah. Let me just get you a fork so you can eat it.  Uh, let me just hold the cake like this,  so I can get you a fork.  Huh, I wonder where I put that fork.  Oops.
Patrick	No, I don't.
Patrick	Yup.
Patrick	You okay, buddy?
Patrick	Yeah, how can we thank you?
Patrick	This!
Patrick	I don't know about this!
Patrick	Wow!  Huh? What is this?
Patrick	I win! I win! I win!
Patrick	I believe the expression is starfish first.
Patrick	Ooh.
Patrick	How embarrassing.
Patrick	To the spy mobile!
Patrick	I think the front door's open.
Patrick	SpongeBob, I have to go.
Patrick	SpongeBob, I have to go now!
Patrick	Patrick!
Patrick	Thanks, SpongeBob.  If I could reach it, I'd do it myself.
Patrick	Tomorrow! SpongeBob, we gotta get to bed so we can be first in line!
Patrick	Oh, look, the bus is here!
Patrick	I swallowed my tickets.
Patrick	Phew.
Patrick	How do I look?  Wow, I look great.
Patrick	Yeah, it's perfectly safe. No one gets hurt riding these roller coasters.
Patrick	Have fun!
Patrick	Yeah, that's the problem with this brand. I'll be right back.
Patrick	SpongeBob, I have to tell you something.
Patrick	Uh-huh.
Patrick	We're not scaredy cats.
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	I did.  Look, Plankton. It's the perfect height for your kind.
Patrick	I've been replaced by a sandwich!  Maybe I could meet a lovely sandwich of my own. Yeah, that'll show SpongeBob.
Patrick	It's our favorite pastime.
Patrick	Can we, Squidward?
Patrick	Special delivery. For this month's Employee of the Month. I wonder who it could be. As if I didn't know.  No, really. who is it? I don't know.
Patrick	Help me spell 'Squidward'.
Patrick	Hey, I want to dance funny, too!
Patrick	[he's dressed in a dark green princess outfit and also has on a diaper as he eats his corn dog] What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
Patrick	Ruling, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Like polishing your empty trophy case?
Patrick	"Hey, everybody, let's all do ""the cramp""!"
Patrick	Get back, I wasn't going to eat all of you!
Patrick	That's me!
Patrick	Hey, look.  I just found $100! It's a sign that I should make my hit record.
Patrick	SpongeBob, could I borrow a pencil and some paper and a place to work?
Patrick	Ohh, dodgeballs.
Patrick	Wait! There's more. When I read it to the class, they pelted me with dodgeballs! Just because we were playing dodgeball!  Whyyyyyy?!
Patrick	Come on, you stupid brain! work!  It's working!
Patrick	My song. Ahh...
Patrick	SpongeBob SquarePants! Are you ready to rock?! Whooo!
Patrick	Do you really think so?
Patrick	Yeah. Did you see his ears?
Patrick	Tally ho! Mush! Onward and upward!  Faster, SpongeBob! Faster!  Oh! Hmm-- This record won't stay put.
Patrick	Uh, Bean Dip?
Patrick	"And that was my new song called, ""Ay..."""
Patrick	There, there, SpongeBob. No need to cry.
Patrick	Oh, 47 seconds!  I miss Sandy so much. Her tentacles,  the way she plays clarinet, her massive nose.
Patrick	This is gonna taste so good again.
Patrick	Augh! Doesn't matter!  Oh, this itch is killing me. Yagh!
Patrick	Mraah!
Patrick	You call this a party? I'm beginning to question  our friendship.
Patrick	Wha...? What happened? Where am I!?  Oh yeah, the party! I must've passed out in SpongeBob's kitchen... on the ceiling.  See, SpongeBob, I told you we shouldn't stay up past 8:30. Things get real crazy after 8:30!
Patrick	...I hate conflicts!!
Patrick	Oh, no... that video will show me stealing SpongeBob's donut..! Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, eee, eee! I gotta hide this thing.  Whew...  Oh...
Patrick	Ah! H-hey, SpongeBob.
Patrick	You mean...  This is mine?
Patrick	Yeah, Pretty good, huh?
Patrick	Ol' Reliable?
Patrick	I miss you! [Cuts to Sandy waving hello, but in guilt  manner because of set-up] Sandy misses you! Even Squidward misses you!
Patrick	I can see you there!  I still see you!  You're gonna look good on my mantel! Friends forever, SpongeBob!  I got you now, SpongeBob!
Patrick	A beautiful specimen, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Oh, I missed it again! This darn camera isn't fast enough.
Patrick	Like presents on Christmas Day, it doesn't seem to stay. Or a cheese souffl, it doesn't last all day.
Patrick	No!  What happened?
Patrick	This is the most beautiful bubble I've ever seen.
Patrick	SpongeBob, when are we gonna see the bubble?
Patrick	Like a delicate air raisin!
Patrick	Ooh! Let's get a picture for our scrapbooks before leave.
Patrick	Plankton's wrath tastes like ice cream.
Patrick	Me too!
Patrick	I have a solution.
Patrick	Oh, yeah. I was gonna put it on this peanut butter taco.
Patrick	Give me!
Patrick	I don't have any money.
Patrick	No problem. Tra-la-la-la-la.  Work, work, work, work.
Patrick	Uh... I have to be very gentle.
Patrick	Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Patrick	Why won't you go down?
Patrick	Are you sure, SpongeBob? Who was this guy, anyway?
Patrick	With tears?
Patrick	There goes a real hero.
Patrick	Well, see you later, bud.
Patrick	Weee! Haha!
Patrick	I had no idea that they had a hot tub!
Patrick	What's wrong, SpongeBob?
Patrick	SpongeBob and I are being chased by a savage beast!
Patrick	Weird. There's a door back here too?
Patrick	Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no. You made the last decision. It's my turn.
Patrick	Uhhh..  Oh shoot! I forgot what I was going to say!
Patrick	Are you kidding? That old coot's been here for years! Look at him: he's in great shape! Look at his muscular arms, his rock-hard abs, and a great complexion, why, he's glowing with health.
Patrick	Oh, boy am I! I'm ssoooooo hungry, I could eat anything! I could eat an entire sponge...
Patrick	Why do you want to eat me?
Patrick	Oops, I forgot the bathbeads!
Patrick	Give me that ketchup back!
Patrick	Why do you care if we're survivalists?
Patrick	Mollusks? What mollusks?
Patrick	Well the best part about it is, I don't have to accomplish anything in life, because my Uncle already did it for me. Really takes the old pressure off.
Patrick	It's Patrick!
Patrick	No! What is it?
Patrick	Pu evig i.
Patrick	Hey! I wanna be opposite too!  Yeah! Finally! Yoo-hoo!  I'm Squidward, I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
Patrick	Thank you!
Patrick	Oh, wait I got it. Ringo...
Patrick	SpongeBob, you're gonna need to speak up. My eardrums aren't what they used to be.
Patrick	Ok.
Patrick	What is it?
Patrick	Yeah, dark.
Patrick	Or even around the block!
Patrick	Yeah?
Patrick	And now we're being bathed in an eerie red light!
Patrick	[the Chum Charges explode around the submarine] SpongeBob! Our hull's been breached. Do you know what that means?
Patrick	It's a liquid.
Patrick	How about now?
Patrick	You mean like those guys?
Patrick	And those who had more important matters with their time
Patrick	Does that bother you, huh, SpongeBob?  They only had one ice cream cone.
Patrick	Well, I guess we can't be friends.
Patrick	Well, says you. I like dirty.
Patrick	Hey, give it back!
Patrick	Your pants are falling down.
Patrick	Why, what's wrong with them?
Patrick	Minty fresh! Taste pit, evildoer!!
Patrick	Oh, yeah?
Patrick	Oh, I'm not going to eat it.
Patrick	Hoppin'...  ..CLAAAAMS!!!  Hey, I got my filth back!
Patrick	My beautiful filth! It's gone! I'm squeaky clean!!
Patrick	Smear slime on my teeth?
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	I don't know. I've been knocking on his door for three hours. I need his hot sauce for my milkshake.
Patrick	Buddy? You there?
Patrick	I'll get ya out of this cage, buddy!  You're safe now in my arms.  Huh? Where'd you go now?
Patrick	Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, Krabby Patty! [he eats the Krabby Patty] SpongeBob, another masterpiece.
Patrick	We're not just...
Patrick	Oops.
Patrick	What's the pas-  Nope, that's not it!
Patrick	Interesting. Let's see how good you are at nothing.
Patrick	Good-bye! Not a word!
Patrick	SpongeBob, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Uh-huh. What's your news?
Patrick	Go ahead, say it, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Natural talent, watch this
Patrick	Can I get mine in pink?  It looks like a tattoo!
Patrick	All right!
Patrick	Don't worry, I'm all ready doing it. (Patrick is eating a sausage)
Patrick	SpongeBob...
Patrick	I can't see a doctor. My job doesn't provide me with health insurance.
Patrick	Did what?
Patrick	Let's do this...  Ya-ha! Hey, your turn.
Patrick	Huh, I don't think you have what it takes.
Patrick	Try to concentrate on your first lesson in weird.  See you on the other side, buddy!
Patrick	What happened?
Patrick	We're in mourning.
Patrick	"Big deal. Wait till you see ""No Patrick Day""? Come on, everyone. Lets go!  Where'd everybody go? Hello? Hello?"
Patrick	No problem.
Patrick	Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you were a doctor. Hmph!
Patrick	Oh, no, no, it looks like you have things under control.
Patrick	Thanks buddy!
Patrick	You said it buddy.
Patrick	Living like Larry. Living like Larry.  This is bogus!
Patrick	To live my friend! We are going to live!  This is going to be the best fun yet!
Patrick	Just you wait! it's the ultimate!  What do you think? And wait 'till you see the best part!  Hey you guys.
Patrick	I see. And that's your final word on the subject?
Patrick	Uh-uh.
Patrick	Uh oh!
Patrick	We did put on a few extra coats of sun screen today.
Patrick	Like one of those hip young old folks on a soda commercial.
Patrick	What?
Patrick	See for yourself.
Patrick	Well, hey buddy, look like you could use an ice cream.
Patrick	Take a look.
Patrick	Whatever. I just gooooo with the flow.
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	Here you go SpongeBob.
Patrick	But you said you didn't want it.
Patrick	Yay!
Patrick	Oh, I got one! You know that thing?
Patrick	What, if you turn the bottle upside down, maybe it'll shrink it.
Patrick	Arms are too short.  Legs are too short.  Other arm.  Feet too small.  Teeth!  Belly button.  Perfect!
Patrick	I know. We should do this...  ...more often.
Patrick	Of course I have a nose, Squidward. Why, it's as plain as the nose on my...  ...face?  You're right, Squidward!
Patrick	There!  Well SpongeBob, what do you think of my new nose?
Patrick	I can do that?
Patrick	Wait, stop, careful SpongeBob! This fragile stitching requires tender care. Allow me to carefully remove the bandages.
Patrick	The smells! They're everywhere! It's unbearable!
Patrick	It's rotten garbage now.  That's better.
Patrick	Oh, I'll help you all right! Help stop you polluting are world with your sweaty holes.  There.
Patrick	Well good! No one should have to eat in this stench!
Patrick	Hello.  No!  All I wanted was to be able to smell like the rest of you.
Patrick	With what?
Patrick	Find out!
Patrick	I can't believe it! It was Squidward!
Patrick	Oh, I'm not taking a bus SpongeBob. I am watching this pole. So the next time it moves, I will see it!
Patrick	Ok.
Patrick	Now, what am I gonna do? I'm all alone behind this rope!
Patrick	I'd love to!
Patrick	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Eeeeeeee!
Patrick	You bet!
Patrick	Look!
Patrick	I kinda like staring at him.
Patrick	Increased chance of precipitation?
Patrick	No!!
Patrick	Now what are we gonna do?
Patrick	So did I, SpongeBob, but I was just mimicking it.
Patrick	SpongeBob, what are you doing?
Patrick	What clam? Ive never seen that clam before in my life.
Patrick	No, silly! A volleyball!
Patrick	Good idea!
Patrick	What do you mean, small fortune?
Patrick	So, did you figure out what youre gonna do with this fat stack of cabbage, yet?
Patrick	You do?
Patrick	Yup!
Patrick	UhIm here to see SpongeBob.
Patrick	Uh, hey guys. Have you seen SpongeBob around?
Patrick	SpongeBob, I gotta tell you something I think you should know: your house is full of strangers!
Patrick	But
Patrick	About what?
Patrick	Yup, I found it!
Patrick	And hairy.
Patrick	Pretending?
Patrick	I can even do it in my sleep.
Patrick	Whoo!
Patrick	Dark?! I'm afraid of the dark.
Patrick	I don't get it.
Patrick	It was so super duper fun.
Patrick	Okay.  And if you think this is bad, wait till I get my hands on ya.  I'm gonna, uh... I'm gonna... tear ya to shreds! Like a...  C'mon! Ah! I got a paper cut! Paper cut!
Patrick	Helicopter.
Patrick	Squeeze.
Patrick	Seventeen...
Patrick	I'm preventing gingivitis.
Patrick	Ha, ha. SpongeBob fly.
Patrick	Good job, SpongeBob. Now let me just get my keys.  Nope.  There you are. I knew you were in there somewhere.
Patrick	I'm the best pal ever. But can you do me one favor?
Patrick	Oh! I don't need any old locksmith.
Patrick	Oh, yeah, yeah. I'll take care of it. There! Good as new!
Patrick	SpongeBob, what's wrong?
Patrick	Well, that pack I bought was full of 'em.
Patrick	Oh, boy! We're gonna get our books signed and then we're gonna meet Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and then we're gonna shake their hands and then they're gonna sign our books!
Patrick	Okay. Hmm... oh, I know! What are those things you use when... after you eat, you need to take a...
Patrick	sary? Yes, it is!
Patrick	What?
Patrick	Pretty cool, huh?
Patrick	Yeah, four scoops.
Patrick	Way to go!
Patrick	Found Squidward.
Patrick	Yeah. Not his fault.
Patrick	Uh...maybe it's your fault.
Patrick	Hey.
Patrick	I don't think Squidward wants to join our lodge.
Patrick	Brother SpongeBob.  Aaahhhh!  Brother Squidward.
Patrick	That sock is way too small.
Patrick	Roo!
Patrick	Only once. To take back some stuff I borrowed.
Patrick	Hello. Uh, may I speak with SpongeBob, uh, uh...  ...Squaaa...re...Paaaaants?
Patrick	A pretty long time. Huh?
Patrick	Hello. Can I help you?
Patrick	Yeah...wake up!
Patrick	You never brought me flowers.
Patrick	Yay!
Patrick	Got what?
Patrick	We are seriously going to kick some elderly buns today! Huh SpongeBob?
Patrick	Oh ya, I forgot. Well Let's go do something else.
Patrick	No! We are! Let's take 'em to the slammer!
Patrick	You're too old!
Patrick	You too missy.
Patrick	I'll say.
Patrick	You better tell him, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Well, I was just saying that these lines you drew remind me of a railroad track.
Patrick	Yes.
Patrick	G-7? King me! King me!  I lose!
Patrick	We could toss that shell back and forth.
Patrick	Bonus points!
Patrick	Well, let's go put him in the warm.
Patrick	Yeah-yeah, that's it, uh-huh.
Patrick	Oh, I thought he was dead.
Patrick	I think they make a cream for that now.
Patrick	I found it.
Patrick	Yes.
Patrick	Oh, coming!  How are we going to clean up all this mess?
Patrick	Boy, he really had us fooled.
Patrick	No, the other thing.
Patrick	Blow harder.  There he goes!
Patrick	Yeah.  He's in a better place.
Patrick	Okay.
Patrick	Looks like he's taking a fancy to you.
Patrick	SpongeBob, I gotta get going. See you later now.
Patrick	Yeah! wait 'till.
Patrick	Sorry to disturb you during work hours. I just wanted to remind you about my birthday.
Patrick	My birthday cake! You're supposed to bring my birthday cake!
Patrick	You're already forgetting one thing!
Patrick	Well, just leave my present over on the present table!
Patrick	You took it to Sandy's?
Patrick	No, not till you deliver my birthday cake.
Patrick	We could've worked something out.
Patrick	Ugh! I hate that hat!  Fine, have it your way, hat!  Hmph. Looks like Squidward has time to play. Hey, Squidward!
Patrick	Standin' around out here all day.
Patrick	Okay.
Patrick	Do I get my hat now?
Patrick	I did?
Patrick	You got it, Mr. K!
Patrick	No! P-please, don't tell Mr. Krabs! You don't understand. For years people have been telling me, You're no good! Now I'm good! I have a hat to prove it! I don't wanna go back to being No Hat Patrick!
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	I'm trying!
Patrick	Uh huh.
Patrick	Look, Squidward, I'm falling!
Patrick	Well, I guess it's back to being to no hat pat!
Patrick	Yeah?
Patrick	Nah.
Patrick	Yeah, that'll happen.
Patrick	Ugh. I'm so bored. There's gotta be something we can do!
Patrick	Ohhhhh!
Patrick	We wanted to go to the toy store but it's not open yet.
Patrick	Wow.
Patrick	Never!
Patrick	Not if we hide.
Patrick	The coast is clear.
Patrick	What?
Patrick	Remember that flashlight I shoved up my ear?
Patrick	Look around you, SpongeBob! We're surrounded!
Patrick	Are we going to the ladies's room again?
Patrick	I know. I'm an interesting guy.
Patrick	Time for what?
Patrick	I knew it! We've been abandoned!
Patrick	Ha ha ha ha.
Patrick	Well, I don't know. Playing with the sand sounds pretty boring.
Patrick	Everything's dandy in Patrick's Kingdom.
Patrick	"Why thank you. Here's a little something for you."""
Patrick	So?
Patrick	This treaty isn't worth the sand it's printed on!
Patrick	You'll never win! Do you hear me!?
Patrick	Oh ya! Two can play at this game!
Patrick	Me too...was it worth it?
Patrick	Oh, I can!
Patrick	...META...A...TAB...TAB...AB...BOL...IC...
Patrick	Go ahead. Say you're sorry.
Patrick	It's okay little fella I don't either.
Patrick	Wait, what are we doing again?  There we go! Chum is Fun!
Patrick	Hm, huh?
Patrick	Huh?!
Patrick	Thanks boss.
Patrick	You got it boss!
Patrick	Here it is.
Patrick	Pointing to a screen
Patrick	Oh! Hey, maybe we can use this.  I borrowed it from Sandy's treedome. It might be our way outta here. Shh! Everybody quiet! Hey, Sandy, I got your radio! If you want it back, come and get it! She'll come.
Patrick	Oh!
Patrick	Ooh! I know. Uh, let's just say are tearful farewells and solemn last words, huh?
Patrick	Owie!
Patrick	What now?
Patrick	Yep. It's three times as fun.
Patrick	SpongeBob, this seems like a strange time to start decorating.
Patrick	Why?
Patrick	He's the weatherman on the news channel. He said
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	One.
Patrick	Darn it!
Patrick	Easy, friend.
Patrick	Eh?
Patrick	Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Patrick	Did somebody say something to eat?
Patrick	That, and the gift shop.
Patrick	Open!
Patrick	What an interesting man
Patrick	Right
Patrick	He's unstoppable.
Patrick	You got it SpongeBob, scootch back a little.  Excuse me
Patrick	Ahh, SpongeBob.
Patrick	I'm on TV?!
Patrick	Ohhh. I get it!  Hi, TV people!  And my mouth is on TV!
Patrick	Cameraman?
Patrick	I gotta go potty!
Patrick	I found you! Duckie Duck!  Quack, quack, quack!
Patrick	Stuck? I can help with that.  There ya go, buddy! Now you're stuck forever!
Patrick	And are you going to let this wringer get between you and your passion? Those sweet tomatoes, crisp onions. Are ya, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Hey! Don't you go crying on me!  Crying never solves anything. I know what always makes you feel better.
Patrick	Look! The ball toss!
Patrick	Ohh! Ohh! The spinning steering wheels! Oh, we gotta do that!
Patrick	Hey pal, want some of my cotton candy? They gave it to me when I won the dart tournament. I got this too!  Check it out!
Patrick	What do you mean?
Patrick	Forget SpongeBob, I don't need him.  I can do whatever I want!  I don't need him.  Forget it, you're not his friend anymore. I gotta keep myself occupied so I don't think about Sponge--  I'm not gonna even say his name! What to do, what to do... I know! I'll have a staring contest!  Ohh, fiddlesticks. That game's too hard.
Patrick	Oh, man -- he's too far gone.
Patrick	Hey, everybody! Wait, that's not what I wanted to say. Now, what was it?
Patrick	Mmm. Crunchity Munchities!
Patrick	Oh, don't get down on yourself, buddy. You can still purchase food for me.
Patrick	No. Oh, but, yes! It's so obvious! You should work at the Krusty Krab. They need a fry cook!
Patrick	Fine, do it your way.
Patrick	No way! It's too late for that now. Krabs doesn't need you anymore.  is your chance to prove you don't need him. Now get in there and earn me some groceries!   My friend here wants to audition for the sponge model role.
Patrick	Yeah, beauty sleep!
Patrick	Oh yah! Yah! Yah! I want that!
Patrick	Share it?
Patrick	Sharing is fun.  Right SpongeBob?
Patrick	What? That's a rip off! I want my money back!
Patrick	"Don't you mean ""our"" new toy?"
Patrick	I thought we were sharing it?
Patrick	Uh, maybe tomorrow.
Patrick	I can't go out! I just washed my hair!
Patrick	You sure?
Patrick	Well, gotta go!
Patrick	You can't take it! It's not fair!
Patrick	Mm-mm!
Patrick	N-n-no!
Patrick	SpongeBob won't let me play with my toy.
Patrick	Communication is key.
Patrick	SpongeBob won't let me play with it.
Patrick	Tattletale!
Patrick	Hmmm... Interesting. Me too! Let's go look for something to do in Old Man Squidward's shed!
Patrick	Hide!
Patrick	We're bored!
Patrick	Ghostified? That's not even a real word.
Patrick	Good night, ghost buddy!
Patrick	I don't either. I can't even eat anything! Food just goes right through me!
Patrick	It's miserable!
Patrick	I win! I win!
Patrick	It must be... The pressure.
Patrick	Who?
Patrick	Hey, I caught one, too! This one's a five-spot.
Patrick	"You mean ""The Jellyfishing Song""?"
Patrick	"It says, ""Future site of the Shelly Super Highway."""
Patrick	I, couldn't tell you.
Patrick	"Oh, . He said, ""Let not your heart walk away from you, lest your mind grow legs and follow it."""
Patrick	Oh, this isn't the middle of nowhere; We're actually on the edge of nowhere!
Patrick	There's one going by right there.
Patrick	Su-Su-Su-Super!
Patrick	A pair of binoculars.
Patrick	Hiya, SpongeBob!  Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Patrick	Uhh... something's missing. I know!  Step into these babies, Hans.  Terrifying.
Patrick	What's it?
Patrick	Are you sure you want to do this?
Patrick	Oooh... I don't know who I am!
Patrick	Oh, no question! You scared the barnacles off that guy!
Patrick	Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I am the Flying Dutchman! Booga, booga, booga, booga! Give me your souls!
Patrick	Yeah, I guess it was your pink hat.
Patrick	Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy lost episode! Stick it in!
Patrick	Hey, what happened? Why are those squiggles on the screen?
Patrick	Star... residence. Patrick speaking.
Patrick	Well, of course you can.
Patrick	Yeah, talk to you later.
Patrick	I like throwing food.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob! I have something that might help.
Patrick	Doesnt bother me.
Patrick	Look at yourself? How do you do that?
Patrick	Did we save Sandy?
Patrick	Hey, hey!
Patrick	Uh, I wasn't being eaten. That monster is my friend. I thought you might like to meet him.
Patrick	And this is  home.
Patrick	He's gonna smash Squidward's place now.
Patrick	Actually... just let me to talk to him for a minute. Psst.
Patrick	Yeah? Okay.  Two cubes, please.
Patrick	Don't feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!
Patrick	AAAAAAHHH!!!! My cuff links! They're missing! Oh, why? Why?
Patrick	Yep. Pearl doesn't make them as good as you do, though.
Patrick	Ah, excuse me, hi.
Patrick	Hey! I found my cuff links!  that's better. Good day, gentlemen.
Patrick	Uh-huh.
Patrick	Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of baggage about drain dealies.
Patrick	Ewwwwww...
Patrick	Why?
Patrick	Okay.
Patrick	I love it!
Patrick	Let's pull it.
Patrick	We won't know unless we pull it!
Patrick	It's the most realistic story I've ever heard!
Patrick	Yeah. And they gave you so much food, you need 2 forks.
Patrick	Just after I scrub this bowl.  Alright, Plankton, time to squeeze the key out of you.  After my tasty snack.  He's clean.
Patrick	Sorry.
Patrick	Anyways, I'm gonna hit the sack. I'm pooped. I'm sure you can relate.
Patrick	Well, I guess he lost us. You ready to call it a day, SpongeBob?  Guess not.
Patrick	Well, I don't think this is the right time for a piggyback ride.
Patrick	That was odd.
Patrick	What do I do? What do I do?  B-R-A-K-E. BRAKE. I can do that. Well, SpongeBob, I think our troubles are over.
Patrick	Hi.
Patrick	Hey, would you quit messing around? You're making me sick.
Patrick	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I'm good at choosing! Hmmmm... let's play innnn... SpongeBob's yard! No! Patrick's! Errrr... SpongeBob!  I'm terrible at choosing! Squidward! You choose!
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	Okay!
Patrick	Tag!You're it!
Patrick	Knock, knock!
Patrick	Squidward's house wants to play too!
Patrick	And we're insulted!
Patrick	Missed.
Patrick	HE'S COUNTING, ANYTHING BUT COUNTING! Quick, SpongeBob! Dig for your life!
Patrick	Buddy! You okay?
Patrick	If I recall correctly, I seem to remember saving your life a few minutes ago.
Patrick	Oh yeah Mama!
Patrick	Yeah! Yeah!  Ha Ha Ha Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!  Hey, how do you stop this thing?
Patrick	Wow!
Patrick	HIIIII-
Patrick	Okay! I'm a genius!
Patrick	Good day, gents! Ahhh, Squidward, I would like a HIYAAA!
Patrick	I don't know what you're talking about. You're the one who called me a karate genius. And, frankly, I'm offended by your previous accusation. I don't need this! I beg you good due.
Patrick	You dare refuse my barter?!?! Than accept my chop!  Ahhh... I don't feel so good.
Patrick	I win, I win, I win!
Patrick	For teaching me how to karate chop, silly.
Patrick	I know! Weird, huh?
Patrick	Not the giant-screen TVs... Oh no!
Patrick	YA YA HIYA AYA!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob? SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SPONGEBOB!!! Oh no, I'm so sorry, my best friend, crushed by all this rubble, entombed in this cheap, plastic bag.
Patrick	SpongeBob, you're okay!
Patrick	Oh I did. Unfortunately, we sea stars have limbs that grow new bodies.
Patrick	Thank you, my good man.
Patrick	Yeah, it looks fun!
Patrick	Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, what do you think Bikini Bottom will be like in the future?
Patrick	Yeah! I love playing Buddy Toss!
Patrick	We're using the advanced rules.
Patrick	But we can play hide and seek too.
Patrick	Vow?
Patrick	SpongeBob, I told you we should have used glue instead of earwax
Patrick	He doesn't wanna play with us.
Patrick	SpongeBob, you've got to learn to say 'no'. Stand up for yourself! You need thicker skin like me! . Oh, hey, which reminds me.  Could you scratch my back?
Patrick	Yes? May I help you?
Patrick	No problem!
Patrick	SpongeBob! Hold still. This won't hurt a bit.
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	SpongeBob?
Patrick	Thousands?!
Patrick	Hey, you're peeking!
Patrick	I- I just have one tiny question.
Patrick	Hide 'n seek sure sounds fun, I just wish I could play!
Patrick	What socks?
Patrick	Seventy-eight, seventy-nine, a hundred! FOUR! A-ha! I found you. I win, I win, I win! In your face  I must be the best hide and seek player ever!
Patrick	Underwear.
Patrick	What's hide and seek?
Patrick	SpongeBob, you're leaking.
Patrick	Well, I'm not afraid of them! Watch this!
Patrick	Spon... Spo... Spo...!
Patrick	You guys go, I'll hold them off.  And if I failed, at least my sacrifice will be delayable!
Patrick	And my favorite is the plaintiff song of the blue whale. Ahem.
Patrick	Please. After you, pal.
Patrick	Aww!
Patrick	Well, let's just check that theory!  Innie!  Wow! How does he do it?
Patrick	No, no! No hints!  Blue! No, clear! No!  That's not it. Hold on, hold on. 14.
Patrick	Oh, fish paste!
Patrick	Uh...
Patrick	Ooh. That's a toughie.  Hmm. Rugged biceps.  Yet, delicate eyelashes. Pass!
Patrick	Round, flat, uh, hexagon.
Patrick	TRIANGLE!!
Patrick	Busy, I'll catch up with you later.
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	My best buddy is trapped in there! You gotta let me through!
Patrick	Not another skunk! How did you beat me again?  Hey. You find it funny to lock up my best friend? Hey I am talking towards you.
Patrick	Geez. Some people are so pushy.
Patrick	Okay, Okay. I think I heard you. I will not sit on anything else. I'll just gingerly lean on this wall.
Patrick	You're it!
Patrick	"But then, who's gonna be not ""it?"""
Patrick	Look at all these cool stuff!  I'm the captain!  Yo, ho, ho, ya mateys! Arr!  Got ya! En garde!  Thanks, SpongeBob. I guess we better be more careful.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, check out the new t-shirt I just made!  Secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hide
Patrick	Keep the change, my good man!
Patrick	Well, maybe they had something against short people. I like their little clothes.
Patrick	Let's do this!
Patrick	Well, I doubt it.
Patrick	Or see?
Patrick	First come, first, serve.
Patrick	"SpongeBob, what do you say we go knock on the door and say ""Hi""?"
Patrick	Look! Our new neighbor must be even shyer than we thought!
Patrick	Here you go, ma'am!
Patrick	Not quite, I was promised a movie, and some plastic popcorn.
Patrick	My big sister, Sam!
Patrick	Thanks man, you're right. I can't wait to make up for our lost years!
Patrick	Sis!
Patrick	I cleaned my rock just for you.
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	Awwww hey sis, don't listen to those...meanies. Hey the new rock is looking kinda...boring. What do you say we decorate it?
Patrick	Hey, just mind your own business and let us blecorate in peace!
Patrick	Come on sis they won't bother us under our rock.
Patrick	Well I guess she can get a little carried away.
Patrick	Cookie Dough!
Patrick	Isn't my sister something?
Patrick	Uh, breakfast, green, Finland.
Patrick	AAAAAAHHH!!!!!
Patrick	Can't wait to lose, huh?  NO! Ooh. If you would just let me finish my stretches, I wouldn't have missed my first shot!
Patrick	Fine. Have it your way.  Ready to give up?
Patrick	Speaking of m-m-MISSING!  Ha! Gotta play it where it lands. Watch and learn, SquarePants. Watch and learn.  YES! See if you can top that!
Patrick	Whatever.  AND HE SINKS ANOTHER HOLE IN ONE! That's two in a row!
Patrick	Show-off. I can do that.
Patrick	Who said anything about noise? We're just gonna get outta the rough and back to the course!
Patrick	Was it a red one?
Patrick	No?
Patrick	Hole in one! Top that!
Patrick	Stop peeking! Hotter. Hotter! Hot! Hot! Cold. Hot. Cold. Hot! Cold.
Patrick	But I wanted to try his loofah.
Patrick	All it takes is a little finesse, SpongeBob. All it takes is a little finesse.
Patrick	Sorry we woke you.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Oh! Some people just don't understand sentimental value.  You're throwing away Pete!? Y-You can't part with a keepsake! That's why you keep them, for Pete's sake! Hmph! Why, I'm disgusted! It's time you re-evaluate your priorities.
Patrick	"Do you mean she puts on ""airs""?"
Patrick	Now that's fancy! They should call you SpongeBob FancyPants!  Remember: When in doubt, pinky out. You can do it, SpongeBob. I'll be watching.
Patrick	No, SpongeBob! No, no, no, stop! Pinky! Pinky!
Patrick	We've got to get out of here!
Patrick	Yup.
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	Sure they do! Giddy up!  Yeah! See?
Patrick	I don't know.
Patrick	It's-s-s... so c-c-cold!
Patrick	Hey!
Patrick	I can't feel my looking holes!
Patrick	Hey, trying to sleep.
Patrick	Oh, that's easy!
Patrick	I sure am old buddy!
Patrick	How do you play that?
Patrick	Wow! You really think so?
Patrick	Hooray!
Patrick	Distinguished?
Patrick	Heh heh, sure are!
Patrick	Oh! Are those chocolate chip cookies? Can I have-
Patrick	Oh, ah no. I said flooring! The flooring compliments the artwork here exquisitely!
Patrick	Why are they so many stairs!?
Patrick	Hey, alright! Box seats! Uh, I mean: This seat choice is most mature! Certainly more so than that rapscallion Sponge whose name we shall not mention will picked!
Patrick	Hey! Stop that beard!
Patrick	Oh, please! You can call me Patrick!
Patrick	Okay.
Patrick	Fine.
Patrick	Oh, come on, SpongeBob, you think everyone can stay awake through a boring speech?
Patrick	That's it!  Fight through!
Patrick	Young man, how dare you!
Patrick	Come on, SquarePants! Is this the best you can do?
Patrick	Wait, buddy! I know how you can get your boating license. Your friend the squirrel girl is real good with her paws.  Maybe she can make you a fake one.
Patrick	Right here. Let me polish them up for ya.  Here ya go.
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	You're an artist?
Patrick	Uh.
Patrick	Whoa. I did not see that coming!
Patrick	I've done it!
Patrick	I'm an artist! Hooray!
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	Um, the artist needs a long time!
Patrick	But I'm wondering if that might be too predictable!
Patrick	Ok, I want new ideas to spice up hunger for my goodly goods!
Patrick	Mm-hmm. Pleasure!
Patrick	And I'm going to need some more of those patty thingies!
Patrick	I can only imagine! Apprentice! Make another of my masterpieces, good man.
Patrick	Giddy-up! Hyah!
Patrick	Right. The slides.  Voila! Uh, now what?
Patrick	As I was saying...  I was lying around my house, not even planning to have a vacation when I heard a knock at my door.  For clammin' out loud! Aww, sheesh! I'm still not there yet?
Patrick	Oh, great. Another thing for me to d--
Patrick	Oh boy!
Patrick	Can you not imply anymore? It's confusing.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob. Going skiing?
Patrick	Oh, it is, SpongeBob! Well first, they make you sit in the waiting room.
Patrick	Exactly.
Patrick	You think so?
Patrick	I'm calling on behalf of my patient, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Feeling better yet?
Patrick	How about now?
Patrick	Uhh, uhh, he's not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep. Beep.
Patrick	Hmmm, the dirt therapy seems to be working just fine.
Patrick	Hey, that's my patient!  You can't take him to the doctor's.
Patrick	What I've done? Everything was fine until you showed up.
Patrick	A lollipop?  Hey, doc, I have the suds, too.
Patrick	I'm not seeing it. Ooh, check out that cloud!  It looks just like a... um, um, um, d'oh, it's coming, uh, looks like a... a cloud.
Patrick	It looks like fun, I'm going to check it out
Patrick	Wow. Look at this place! It's so cheesy! Check out this lame doorknob.
Patrick	Nice attention to detail, though.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, check this out!
Patrick	We do!
Patrick	Oh, whoops! You're right. I almost forgot. You're coin-operated, aren't you?
Patrick	This show is going to be so awesome.
Patrick	That's more like it!
Patrick	And it was full of ghosts! The really, real kind, not fake kind!
Patrick	Again?
Patrick	Get me out of here!
Patrick	Not really. I don't like plain doughnuts.
Patrick	Okay, okay! Man, you're pushy! How about... a Krabby Patty? With pickles! And ketchup! Wait, wait, wait, I know! I want... a plain doughnut!
Patrick	Oh, hmm... I don't know. We might be able to pull through...  the first hour.
Patrick	Check.
Patrick	We wanna watch your TV!
Patrick	Whoa! You're like a brain professor!
Patrick	I'm talking to my friend, Funny.  Hi, Funny!
Patrick	Don't worry, I know what I do. You're gonna need one of these.
Patrick	Got it! Hey, do you have any more of those deep fried cream filled sugar-coded coral balls?
Patrick	SpongeBob!  Don't you trust me? I am the most responsible guy you know!
Patrick	Oh. Looks like my tummy is having an argument with the coral balls. Ohhh...
Patrick	Step aside, Barry. Let me show you how it's done.  Ooh. Gotta try a bite of this.  Ahh.  Good stuff.
Patrick	Hello?
Patrick	Gotta get the water to stay in there somehow.  Now, Gary, we don't eat the bath. We get in the bath.  Come on, Gary.  Oh, don't be difficult now, Gary.  Gary!  There you are!  Oh, what now?  SquarePants household.
Patrick	Okay, I get it, SpongeBob! I get it, I get it!  No!  I don't get these new beguiled shower heads.   Gary! Time for your-   Wait a minute, Patrick! You gotta trick the snail!  You gotta be smarterer than him!  Hey, buddy! I got something cool to show you. And it's the opposite of a wet watery bath.  Take it down!
Patrick	That wasn't so bad, now was it?
Patrick	Who is this?
Patrick	Well, in that case, I'd better stay and help you.
Patrick	Pretty please with a scoop of vanilla ice cream?
Patrick	I, Patrick Star, hereby promise not to touch anything.
Patrick	Is this close enough?
Patrick	Not... look at anything.
Patrick	Hey buddy, it's not as bad as it seems.
Patrick	SpongeBob, this is it, our final goodbye.
Patrick	It wasn't me.
Patrick	What's that?
Patrick	Keep it jazzy, Miles. And thanks for the grub.
Patrick	Wow.  Medesonium prodamy!
Patrick	I must have more.
Patrick	Even I knew that was dumb.
Patrick	Never mind. She seems fine.
Patrick	I thought she was with you.
Patrick	Just a little bit further. Okay, got it.
Patrick	An oxygen tank! Great idea, buddy.
Patrick	Ah, ah! Oof!
Patrick	Oh my gosh! Sponge...SpongeBob is stuck inside this rock!  Hold on buddy, I'll get you out!  SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
Patrick	You do?
Patrick	How about now?
Patrick	You gotta tell me!
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	Cotton candy! I can't believe it!  Cotton candy!
Patrick	This guy?
Patrick	I'm pretty sure it's not up there, SpongeBob!
Patrick	What's that?
Patrick	And even though I was expecting more...
Patrick	Patrick needs love, too!
Patrick	Huaaagh!
Patrick	They didn't get me anything either!  Nope, it's too late for that now... for all of you!
Patrick	You must think I'm pretty dumb, huh?
Patrick	Hi Sandy!
Patrick	Hehe.
Patrick	Can I watch you work?
Patrick	Hi Squidward!
Patrick	Oh yeah!  But we are going to need a new toilet plunger. This one's broken.
Patrick	It's after SpongeBob!  You're right button! No monster is going to eat our friend!
Patrick	Oh!!! AH HAH HAH HAH HAH!
Patrick	Guys, what did I tell you before? I'm trying to get some shuteye!
Patrick	I don't know, but all of this failure is tiring me out. I'm just gonna take a nap on that rock right over there.
Patrick	Uh, I'll have one Relish Patty. Hold the mayo.
Patrick	Hey, buddy! You really need to get this place cleaned up.
Patrick	Oh, nothing. I'm just hanging with the sponge. How about you?
Patrick	Oh take your time...
Patrick	It's just not a house without a rock to sleep under.
Patrick	Mmmm, Spongecake.
Patrick	And the sleepy boy was the sleepiest boy in all the kingdom!
Patrick	"Hmmm... oh I know! I'll sing you a lullaby from my childhood! ""Get up be active, Get up be active, Get up be active, GET UP BE ACTIVE! GET UP BE ACTIVE! GET UP BE ACTIVE! Get up don't lie down! Get up don't lie down! Get uup don't lie downnn!"
Patrick	Get up don't lie down! Get up don't lie down!
Patrick	Hocus, pocus!
Patrick	And she invented the secret elixir for just such an emergency. Drink up.
Patrick	Oops..
Patrick	That's a pretty cool face.  Check you this one out.
Patrick	Done and done.
Patrick	Dun ah eeh.
Patrick	You mean like this?  Ree eeh eeh!
Patrick	Dun ree ah yee!
Patrick	Looo ooo ooo!
Patrick	: Hey Spongebob!
Patrick	Oh yeah? Watch me.
Patrick	Oh. Uhhh, is this a bad time, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Glove World!?
Patrick	Uh, it feels good.
Patrick	She gloves me, she gloves me not.
Patrick	Goodbye Tilt-A-Hurl.
Patrick	I think you know where pal.
Patrick	Excuse me.
Patrick	It's free from it's mornings!  SpongeBob what are you doing? We must remain seated in all times!
Patrick	Thanks!
Patrick	Ok.
Patrick	It is?
Patrick	SpongeBob, I'm not a stupid. Come one, come all, to the new, the improved...
Patrick	Thanks!
Patrick	Come back here!
Patrick	Well, there is one thing we can do.
Patrick	What key?
Patrick	It's a trap! A trap for Santa!
Patrick	I think it's pretty obvious, SpongeBob! I'm eating fruitcake and setting a tiger trap for Santa! Now, if you don't mind, I'm kind of busy right now.
Patrick	Oh, no! I knew this day would come! Invasion of the Giant Patties! There's only one thing to do! It's eat or be eaten!
Patrick	You okay, little buddy?
Patrick	Whatever!
Patrick	Ok, now turn around! Open wide!  Wider!  Perfect!  Ready?
Patrick	Hey, I can see my house from here!
Patrick	I agree!
Patrick	I got this!
Patrick	Yeah! C'mon sweaty.
Patrick	Boy, would I?!
Patrick	Uhh... let's see, uhh...  that way captain!
Patrick	And hungry.
Patrick	I know.
Patrick	Nothing.
Patrick	Did you notice something familiar about this map?
Patrick	I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Uh, Mr. Krabs? Where do I put this?
Patrick	Uh...oh! Yeah, I can't.
Patrick	Or...they came to see the meteor shower that passes through the Aurora Borealis generating a stunning, once-in-a-lifetime light show.
Patrick	I can't see anything.
Patrick	Wow!
Patrick	Extreme spots? Well, that's no fair. You're already covers in extreme spots. Ooh. Hold on a second.  Okay, let's do meet our new heroes.
Patrick	D'uh.  My best friend is SpongeBob, he has a square head, I try on his clothes while he's asleep in bed.
Patrick	I want a clean fight. I don't wanna see any trash laying around.  Oohh...We give up! Fling  That was close.
Patrick	How revolting.
Patrick	Amazing!
Patrick	Oh yeah, well uh, you know what's sad? This.
Patrick	Think about it. Think, Patrick think. Hmmmmm... hmmpphh!  Thinking is painful.  Break time.
Patrick	It's Patrick-Man, Mr. Krabs.
Patrick	Just remember this: Violence solves nothing!
Patrick	Nah, enough!!! This dollar shall stay on the sidewalk, where it belongs.  With Neptune's swiftness, away!
Patrick	Jammed doors, huh?  A likely story. With Neptune's swiftness,  away!
Patrick	Overboaaard??!! You call this overboard?! Away with Neptune's  Swiftness!  Villains and criminals, beware!  Patrick-Man is here!
Patrick	Admit it, masked marauder!
Patrick	No way! [ Hey! Where'd he come from?
Patrick	Take this, beast!
Patrick	Why of course, young man. That's uh, SpongeBob with two 7s, right?
Patrick	Hey SpongeBob, Gary.
Patrick	Hey, guys, check this out!A Pet Point 3000!
Patrick	Huh? Oh, there it is. Hey, do you smell something burning?
Patrick	He's mumbling and drooling like a little baby
Patrick	Thanks for sharing baby
Patrick	Don't worry. I got this.
Patrick	How much do you need?
Patrick	Wow...
Patrick	Where's 'Leaving Bikini Bottom'?
Patrick	Where is this, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, the bus is here.  SpongeBob...!
Patrick	Do you know how to swim?
Patrick	It's all purple and sticky.
Patrick	Yeah, but with visual aids.
Patrick	Or an awesome toupe.
Patrick	It's awesome.
Patrick	Oh, fine. Here. I don't need that old stick anyways.
Patrick	I'll catch up! I've gotta use the can!
Patrick	Howdy, SpongeBlob! I'm so glad you could  around.  Glad.
Patrick	Good thing we landed on SpongeBob.
Patrick	Bubbles. That's your answer for everything.
Patrick	Okay. First we climb up the walls.  Then, we slide down the chimney and eat up all the milk and cookies they left out for us!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob! I got an idea! Let's use this grappling hook!
Patrick	Oh, right!  I'll use the finesse.
Patrick	See if it's safe.
Patrick	I'm on it.
Patrick	I guess we showed that old horror movie who's boss.
Patrick	Darn old horror movie. Why couldn't we watch a cartoon instead?  Do you hear that?
Patrick	Uh, hello? Someone there?Uh, uh?What's that? There's something stuck... Huh. Oh, wait a second. Oh, yeah. That's the spot. A little to the left. Oh, yeah. All right. Right there.
Patrick	What about this? (Patrick holds Gary)
Patrick	Okay.
Patrick	But where's Rusty?
Patrick	Sorry SpongeBob, but this is the part of the story where I run away again only this time I don't know where to run to, so I'm just gonna go circling around the building
Patrick	This, uh, is getting creepy.
Patrick	Hiya SpongeBob!  Whatcha doin'?
Patrick	Arrrgh! Get them off me! Get them off me!
Patrick	Where?
Patrick	Texas is dumb?
Patrick	Get a dog little longie! Get a dog!
Patrick	Krusty Krab, here we come!  Can we say that plants from Texas are dumb? Can we say that shoes from Texas are dumb?
Patrick	For you!
Patrick	Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I heard you crying and it made me sad.
Patrick	Fried Frittatas?
Patrick	Hey, that's great! Being unemployed is the best gig I know!  I tell you what. Meet me tomorrow morning, and I'll introduce you to the wonders of the unemployed lifestyle.
Patrick	That's the spirit!  Now, the first stop on our tour of fun-employment is a healthy breakfast with our good friend Mr. Squidward.  Hey, Squidward! How are you this fine morning?
Patrick	Are you feelin' any better yet?
Patrick	Oh, boy, lunch!
Patrick	Don't listen to him, SpongeBob. You need to follow your heart.
Patrick	Same way I always do. Scott gave me a ride in his pedicab.
Patrick	:  Yes, sir!
Patrick	: I guess I'll have one of these business sandwiches everybody's talking about.
Patrick	": But I never wanted anything so much in my whole life! Since this morning when I wanted a donut-night at the ""Donut"" and it was great! The donut is gone!  The donut is gone!"
Patrick	:  Well, I'd be stupid not to!
Patrick	: Oh man!  It looks executively delicious!
Patrick	: Hed be given a sandwich and sent on his way?
Patrick	: A sandwich?
Patrick	: Oh, wait!  And heres a little house with smoke coming out of the chimney. See what I mean?  I guess he likes my chart, 'cause hes smiling.
Patrick	: Well, uh, lets see. Uh, dont tell me! I-I know its not sandwiches. They dont get sandwiches. Do they?
Patrick	: Oh, yeah? Well, Ive got a surprise for you.  You cant fire me! Im not an executive at all! Im just a guy who happens to like sandwiches! So, go ahead! Send me away forever as a corporate spy if you want to! But not before I've had my say!
Patrick	: Yeah. Well, its pretty nice I guess.
Patrick	: Lets go home, SpongeBob.
Patrick	They're over here.
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	That's a pretty good thing I thought of. Huh? Well...
Patrick	It's Patrick! Um, Meow!
Patrick	Bye, SpongeBob.
Patrick	I like the first part but I don't understand the second part.
Patrick	Ha-ha-ha, you said tummy.
Patrick	Oh, faster?
Patrick	His homework?
Patrick	SpongeBob, I don't wanna do this.
Patrick	But I didn't know I had to pay!
Patrick	The taste.
Patrick	"I am rolling the dice!  Now I am moving!  ""Run...Spreadsheets""?"
Patrick	Doesn't everything grow on trees?
Patrick	Yeah! The opernive... word is think!  Thanks, Squidward! I'll do it!
Patrick	Yeah! Well, I made it easier and faster!
Patrick	Uh...  Best two out of four?
Patrick	Squidward, I got it!  Whose rope is longer? You...  Aww! You played this before!
Patrick	And so it begins.
Patrick	Welcome, gamers! And behold!  My game!
Patrick	Alright!  I'll explain the rules. Each player picks a piece to move around the board. The way you decide which player gets to pick the piece by rolling the dice.  To decide who gets to roll the dice first to see who gets the first choice of players, you have to be...
Patrick	Hmm...  Okay!  Oh, money!!
Patrick	My turn!  One... two...
Patrick	Hey! You can't roll the dice when you're in jail!
Patrick	Now, sit back down, you criminal!
Patrick	Jail for Squidward!
Patrick	If a person declares outsidies, then everyone must go outside.
Patrick	Game over!
Patrick	That doesn't sound tasty.
Patrick	Hey, did we do good?
Patrick	I knew it!
Patrick	Hey, yeah. Whatever he said.
Patrick	Uh, the first one?
Patrick	Two.
Patrick	I don't know if I wanna do it this way.
Patrick	Forty-eight, forty-... nine,  Oh! Oh, fifty!
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	There's only one fair thing to do.
Patrick	I'm in charge.
Patrick	Oh... I'll fix that.
Patrick	Looks like you'll have to start over.
Patrick	You're not leaving until I say so!
Patrick	Mr. Pavlovi, tell SpongeBob to open the door!
Patrick	Huh, hee, whooah-oh-hoo-hoo...!
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	Uh, sorry, SpongeBob.
Patrick	The job's taken.
Patrick	Admit it! You have been bested!
Patrick	No really, I do hate work!  Everybody's laughing! Oh hey SpongeBob, I got something for ya!
Patrick	What?
Patrick	It's a forever hike.
Patrick	Wow!
Patrick	Cause Nick Fishkins bought my home and then he bought SpongeBob's home.
Patrick	Maybe I can move in with whoever's in my house.
Patrick	"And I could learn what ""learn"" is."
Patrick	What do you play?
Patrick	That was great! You should give lessons to my ex-neighbor, Squidward! He stinks!
Patrick	So...is Nick Fishkins gonna live in my house?
Patrick	That was Nick Fishkins.
Patrick	Hmm, I don't know.
Patrick	It must have been pretty good to make him cry like that.
Patrick	So many flavors.
Patrick	Krabby Patties: They taste so nice, that they taste nice.
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	Aww.
Patrick	"""Tastes so nice that they taste nice."""
Patrick	Tastes so nice, it... uh...  blah, blah, blahblahbli-blah...
Patrick	I wish things could go back to the way they were. Mm...  I just wanna be able to share one pair of pants with my best friend without it being in the papers.
Patrick	I thought they tasted familiar!
Patrick	No, no, I don't wanna eat another one of those things!
Patrick	Good evening, ladies and... the other ones. I know you're all excited to see the 400th commercial, but before we see it, I just want to say...
Patrick	"A friend always helps. It's called ""frelping,"" and I was very frelpful."
Patrick	Yeah, it's only, um...  June o'clock.
Patrick	Try what?
Patrick	Thanks, Sandy!
Patrick	Oh.  They licked the Nutty Butter off my back.  And now they're here for more.
Patrick	Hold on! I got this!
Patrick	I didn't know there was gonna be a test!
Patrick	But I wasn't com...
Patrick	Oh, I think they were all good things.
Patrick	Well, maybe he just thought it was funny. And... and when he said that Krabby Patties taste like old baseball gloves...
Patrick	Well, that's what my last note was about, SpongeBob. I was upset that people take everything I say the wrong way.
Patrick	Mr. Krabs!
Patrick	Mr. Krabs?
Patrick	You did it wrong, Squidward.
Patrick	I don't wanna be a hog. I'll just eat what's leftover.
Patrick	But I'm hungry!
Patrick	Hunger!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob! I can't believe you can actually fly like you said in your letter!
Patrick	"And here's the second page! ""To see you as a real pilot, SpongeBob. Here are some other things I like to see: candy rain, a firetruck full of clowns, and... a bunch of other stuff."""
Patrick	Candy rain, check!
Patrick	Take what now?
Patrick	No, wait.
Patrick	Really? Well, if you don't mind, I have a couple of other things I'd like to see.
Patrick	Uh, hey. No running in the halls!
Patrick	I have a headache inside of my tooth!
Patrick	No way! I've heard horror stories!
Patrick	No problem. I was just leaving.
Patrick	You leave my baby tooth alone, you monster!
Patrick	I don't care, SpongeBob! I know what's best for my tooth! I can make it happy.
Patrick	Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Patrick	Okay, SpongeBob. I guess I have to get my tooth to the Tooth Fairy.
Patrick	You'll have to catch me first!
Patrick	You may have called off your worms, but I'm not coming down!
Patrick	I thought you kept them in the scrapbook!
Patrick	That's it?
Patrick	Oh, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Could you wait 'til I'm asleep and put it under my pillow?
Patrick	Uhh!
Patrick	He is the new royal fry cook and you...
Patrick	Only two? What are two challenges to someone like SpongeBob?
Patrick	SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!  SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!
Patrick	"Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me: ""Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds."" Well, just look at me now.  Go get 'em, tiger!"
Patrick	Now you.
Patrick	No, I want it!
Patrick	Sorry to hear about your TV, SpongeBob.
Patrick	And the propeller tickles my think folds!  Hey, hey, hey, SpongeBob! Eye bump!
Patrick	Squidward, are you in here? Did you fall in? Squidward!
Patrick	I thought we were the first kids on the block to get whirly brains!
Patrick	M-O-O-N.  That spells moon!
Patrick	Brain, brain, brain! I think I found it, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Oh, yeah! Lookin' good!
Patrick	My think is clogged.
Patrick	Only something, Mermaid Man! You can't mean...
Patrick	Mermaid Man, our hero! Barnacle Boy, you too!
Patrick	Mermaid Man, that injured victim's bandages have come undone!
Patrick	Hmm. Nope.  Ah.
Patrick	"You can't fool me, ""me."" That's the worst SpongeBob impression I've ever seen."
Patrick	That went well!
Patrick	I like cooking with lard!
Patrick	Fire in the hole!
Patrick	That was sheer beauty.
Patrick	This isn't my rug! Wherewhere am I? Who am I?  Who am I?  How am I?
Patrick	Oh, we'll have to create another Squidward in the lab.
Patrick	Oh, whose dumb idea was that?
Patrick	Eww.  It tickles.
Patrick	One second.
Patrick	What's going on?
Patrick	Uh, um.
Patrick	This place is so shiny.
Patrick	Yummy.
Patrick	Mine, mine!
Patrick	I'm happy, SpongeBob!  Can someone get me out of here?  Whew!
Patrick	Can someone get me out of here?
Patrick	Hey SpongeBob!  You're in your underwear. That's cool.  I got your mail. What is it?
Patrick	Huh. Well finally, something I'm good at!
Patrick	You got a sea spider on your head.
Patrick	Turn the volume up inside of your voice!
Patrick	Zap me with your pain juice!
Patrick	You're untouchable!
Patrick	You can't be hurt!
Patrick	Now I'm yelling too!
Patrick	Good morning!
Patrick	Ah, one quarter.
Patrick	It's a giraffe!
Patrick	Yeah, technique.
Patrick	It's not leaving. It's just taking a break.  We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carni...  We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town.  I'm gonna be first in line for everything!
Patrick	Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it.
Patrick	Am I ever. You should try it.
Patrick	Wheeee.
Patrick	Again?
Patrick	You're not going to work today. We're going to go play hooky!
Patrick	Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob. You look so sparkly today.
Patrick	Boo!
Patrick	Save us, SpongeBob! Save us! No wait.  Okay, now save us!
Patrick	Birthday happy.
Patrick	Poke. Poke. Poke.
Patrick	Yeah, I was leaving under watering my plant.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, wanna see my new shoes?
Patrick	Yes.
Patrick	Your shoes are still untied.
Patrick	What was that? Are you okay, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob... You're shorter. Have you been dieting?
Patrick	Whoa-ho, right on, Squidward!
Patrick	No, this is Patrick!  I'm not a Krusty Krab.
Patrick	Uhh...
Patrick	Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum?
Patrick	No!
Patrick	Hooray!
Patrick	I don't either. Maybe it's the way you're dressed.
Patrick	Better try the reflection test.
Patrick	Sure they would! It makes them feel better about the way they look! Maybe a story will cheer you up.  It's called, 'The Ugly Barnacle.'  Once there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly that everyone died! The end.
Patrick	SpongeBob, you're never going to feel better unless you get this thing off your chest.
Patrick	No. Proud.
Patrick	Louder!
Patrick	Don't worry about him, SpongeBob. He's just a-  SpongeBob? SpongeBob, what's wrong?
Patrick	Look at it!  Look at it! Look at it! Look at it! I want all of you to look at it!
Patrick	I just want some-
Patrick	Wouldn't you like to know?
Patrick	What's my mom gonna say?
Patrick	Oh, some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
Patrick	Whatcha mean?
Patrick	Don't be a silly head!  See? I told you not to-  Get it off me!  It's got me in its death grip!
Patrick	I wanna try! I wanna try!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, if you were a god like Neptune here what would you do?
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award.
Patrick	But, it's shiny.
Patrick	I want an award.
Patrick	Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!
Patrick	Fireman?
Patrick	Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job.
Patrick	Do I get my award, now?
Patrick	Barnacles!
Patrick	No! this is Patrick!
Patrick	What's the point? I can't do anything right.
Patrick	Yes.
Patrick	I did?  Touchdown! I'm jarmaster!
Patrick	But I didn't. I opened the jar with my hand. And it was all because you showed me how to do it. I'm never gonna forget this.
Patrick	Well, back to the ol' grind.
Patrick	Yes.
Patrick	Thanks.
Patrick	Until I have as many awards as you.
Patrick	Oh, no, you don't!
Patrick	What's so great about being a Big Pink Loser?  Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.
Patrick	Yay!  Eee!
Patrick	You want some?
Patrick	I'm on it.
Patrick	That's difficult to imagine, but I'd like to see us try.
Patrick	Ooh!  Ow!
Patrick	Yeah?
Patrick	Well, where could they be?
Patrick	Krabby Patties taste so nice, um, that they taste nice.
Patrick	Oh, oh, Krabby Patties taste so nice, that they taste nice!
Patrick	They taste nice!
Patrick	This ain't your grandma's Krabby Patty!
Patrick	Teasing isn't nice.
Patrick	Mine!
Patrick	You're right! My ears! They're gone!
Patrick	You're right. I should really invest in some sun block.
Patrick	Nuts! Haha!
Patrick	No? Then, what have I been putting in my coffee?
Patrick	That's why they'll never know its me.  It's brilliant!
Patrick	Uh, Patrick.
Patrick	SpongeBob, my eyes! I'm seeing double!
Patrick	Uh, do they jump in the fountain and splash each other and play Marco Polo?  Do they? Do they?
Patrick	You're welcome.
Patrick	He understands me. It's almost like we share the same brain.
Patrick	I wish I had a little sea star inside of me.
Patrick	Oh! What?
Patrick	Oh, don't worry, SpongeBob. Happens to me all the time. They grow back.
Patrick	It looks just like the one in New York City.
Patrick	I am a star! Mr. SquarePants, I'm ready for my close-up!
Patrick	They're in the monkey business?
Patrick	A castle? With a pretty princess?
Patrick	But does it...
Patrick	He was nice to me.
Patrick	"I think the question is ""Did it see us?"""
Patrick	I don't believe in walruses. I just believe in me... and you SpongeBob.
Patrick	Uh-huh. You said is, SpongeBob. One of a kind.
Patrick	Hello, SpongeBob!
Patrick	No, that's Italian, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Gee, SpongeBob, I don't want today to end ever.
Patrick	Wormy? Where's Wormy? What's that thing?
Patrick	Why does this keep happening to me?!
Patrick	Or worse, it might eat Sandy's pets.
Patrick	SpongeBob! Hurry up with that net!
Patrick	Just like it ate Wormy!
Patrick	Mr. Krabs?
Patrick	Monster on the loose!
Patrick	Yes sir! Just like a genie!
Patrick	I have one answer, and one answer only.  Applesauce.
Patrick	That sounds like the manager of the new Krusty Krab 2. Oops. Hold on. Congratulations, buddy.
Patrick	Good luck, SpongeBob. Hey, look for me at the ceremony. I got a little surprise for you. I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah.
Patrick	Hey, it's the new Krusty Krab 2 manager!  Wow, the pressure's already setting in.
Patrick	Well, saying you're a kid, it's like saying  a kid!
Patrick	Okay, see you.
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	Fi--ve.
Patrick	What's my name?
Patrick	Wow!
Patrick	Kids?!
Patrick	Yup.
Patrick	By car.
Patrick	I know. Walk in and ask him for it.
Patrick	Ahem! Can I have everybody's attention?  I have to use the bathroom.
Patrick	SpongeBob, it's the Goofy Goober theme song.
Patrick	Okay.  We're on a baby hunt. And don't think we don't know how to weed them out.
Patrick	You know me, SpongeBob.
Patrick	I think we have a few minutes before he gets here.  Huh?  He's right on top of us!
Patrick	Hold the mayo!
Patrick	Hey! I ordered a double Krabby Patty.
Patrick	Come on, tummy. It's gonna be a long day.
Patrick	Hey, what's with all the questions? Who are you guys?
Patrick	SpongeBob! Why aren't you at the Krusty Krab making Krabby Patties?
Patrick	Yeah, yeah, loyalty. I'VE GOT SPONGEBOB! HE'S OVER HERE!
Patrick	What? Huh?!
Patrick	Does anyone have a picture of ketchup?
Patrick	Run!
Patrick	Well, maybe if you didn't have four feet!
Patrick	Hey, my friend's talking to you!
Patrick	SpongeBob, you would not believe the size of the ice creams here. [Squidward strides up] I wonder what other giant snacks they have.  Cotton candy!
Patrick	Will it be a happy ending?
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	Forget my dumb idea, that's great!
Patrick	Then I'm going in for you!
Patrick	Green.
Patrick	And they said I'd never make anything out of myself.
Patrick	You're the most adult person I know.
Patrick	"Allow me to demonstrate. First, puff out your chest.  Now say ""tax exemption."""
Patrick	And then you get behind her and I'll push.
Patrick	Keep 'em coming, Granny!
Patrick	Oh, Grandma, I'm full.
Patrick	Sorta....  this finger hurts a little bit too.
Patrick	Om.....
Patrick	Sure did.
Patrick	I hate this channel.
Patrick	I love... fried oyster skins.
Patrick	Are you Squidward?  That's OK, take your time.
Patrick	What about this towel from the Sizzling Spring Sauna?
Patrick	I don't know. What do you want to do today?
Patrick	No, wait!  Instead of borrowing the money, why don't we just borrow the balloon?!
Patrick	This is so great!
Patrick	And then my backyard!
Patrick	How are we going to return it now, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Wha-guh!
Patrick	He's onto us!
Patrick	Yup.
Patrick	I'm scared, SpongeBob!
Patrick	I want ice cream!
Patrick	Yeah!  And we can fly!
Patrick	And we owe it all to  you.
Patrick	Rectangles!
Patrick	Where'd it go? I'm gonna starve.  Where'd it go?
Patrick	Oh, so that's how it is, huh? Once a thief, always a thief.
Patrick	I don't want it unless you admit you took it.
Patrick	You better not!   I'm warning you!
Patrick	Don't!  Oh!
Patrick	First the balloon, now my candy bar... you're out of control! I'm...  ...I'm telling on you.
Patrick	I'm not good.
Patrick	Just like a genie. (laughs)
Patrick	Ooh, ooh, me, me!
Patrick	SpongeBob, I ripped my paper. Could I have another one?
Patrick	Here you go, SpongeBob.
Patrick	He probably just stopped for a snack! Fat guys get hungry right?
Patrick	Yay! Yay! Ha-ha! I'm gonna beat you there! I'm gonna... ah, it's gonna be fun! Ah-ha...
Patrick	"When are you gonna learn, SpongeBob? ""No"" means ""yes""!"
Patrick	What, I was just reading this candy bar wrapper, see?
Patrick	That is one tired tree.
Patrick	Yeah! I'm getting away! Faster!
Patrick	Uh, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Fun's over.
Patrick	Hey, Sandy! Don't wake up!
Patrick	Who you calling Pinhead? I want to be Dirty Dan!
Patrick	I'm Dirty Dan.
Patrick	I'm Dirty Dan.
Patrick	Uh? I am?
Patrick	Ouch!
Patrick	I'm so cold that I'm shivering!
Patrick	Maybe?
Patrick	Sponge, I'm a big man. A big, BIG man!
Patrick	Man, that fur really hits the spot! No more frozen armpits.
Patrick	Oh boy, would I!
Patrick	Brush brush brush, brush brush brush
Patrick	A sleep-over! Oh boy, oh boy! This is gonna be great, Gary. We can stay up till dawn and watch scary movies and eat popcorn and play board games
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Hold it right there, DadMom AngryPants!
Patrick	Hi SpongeBob.
Patrick	Here it comes
Patrick	Gary? I thought what we had was special...!
Patrick	Yello?
Patrick	How about some soup on your best day ever?  Here we go!  Oh, it's a little hot.
Patrick	I think we gotta show him how it's done.
Patrick	You got what you wanted, Squidward! You can do that distance! Use that net!
Patrick	I had fun.
Patrick	You know, from yesterday!
Patrick	Touch.
Patrick	Ice cream?
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob! Did you get into that club?
Patrick	I'll get the Aqua-Glove.
Patrick	MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA!
Patrick	But you said you had a question.
Patrick	Doesn't look familiar to me.
Patrick	Yup.
Patrick	It's not my wallet.
Patrick	Oops!
Patrick	I've got one. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What is it?
Patrick	Let go!
Patrick	Gesundheit.
Patrick	...and Barnacle Boy!
Patrick	Thank goodness for invisible seat belts.
Patrick	Squirrel fur!
Patrick	Tell the one about the squirrel and the light bulbs.
Patrick	I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite.  Ah.
Patrick	Airhead...  Huh?
Patrick	I'm gonna do it quick and get it over with. Cannonball!  Hey, I lost my trunks! Hi, SpongeBob!
Patrick	What are we hanging around watching a cheap imitation? Let's get over there!
Patrick	Oh boy, did I miss it?
Patrick	"Man, if I see the guy who upset Clamu, I've got a few choice words for him, like ""you""... and ""are"" ... and ... ""a jerk!"""
Patrick	Gotcha!
Patrick	Yes! No wait, uh... no.  But this grain of sand looks pretty suspicious, and so does this rock!  And I've got a few questions for this little piece of grass! Don't worry, SpongeBob! Patrick's on the case! The truth will be revealed!
Patrick	Wow, you guys are good. I'm the last person I would have suspected, but I was looking for me all the time! It's the perfect crime!
Patrick	I knew it!
Patrick	Clean...
Patrick	I don't know. Why?
Patrick	Uhh...
Patrick	No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
Patrick	Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!  Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
Patrick	Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
Patrick	Let's leave!
Patrick	It would seem we have reached an impasse.
Patrick	Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier!
Patrick	Uhh...
Patrick	Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum?
Patrick	No!
Patrick	Two...
Patrick	Whatcha drawin'?
Patrick	SpongeBob, your drawing's coming to life!
Patrick	Now all I need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true.
Patrick	Come on! I was just gonna draw a cartoon.
Patrick	Poor Squidward.
Patrick	He's got the pencil.
Patrick	What just happened?
Patrick	Finland!
Patrick	Oh, boy, a surprise party! Is it his birthday?
Patrick	Take it easy, it's just a drawing.
Patrick	It's the evil doodle!
Patrick	Ready!
Patrick	Hey, hands off, PeepingBob! This here is my secret box! Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Duh!  Oh, SpongeBob if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life!
Patrick	Do I?
Patrick	Gasp. I never would have guessed.
Patrick	For the last time, SpongeBob, no!
Patrick	Friends.
Patrick	EH?!  WHO'S THAT?!  Mmm... water.  Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside.  Nighty-night, boxie.
Patrick	Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me.
Patrick	Nahhh, you can look inside it if you really want to.
Patrick	Good night, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Kicking? I wanna do some kicking!
Patrick	These are some ugly looking fish.
Patrick	Who is that?  Hello?
Patrick	Well, I'm listening.
Patrick	Oooooooh, sweep sweep!
Patrick	No, it's not that, SpongeBob; it's worse.
Patrick	And, I got this message from my parents!
Patrick	But don't they watch television?
Patrick	A, B, C, D, E, F, G...  Oh! H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O...!
Patrick	Well I know where it...
Patrick	What a surprise!
Patrick	No, SpongeBob. Show them your house!  No, not your blouse! Your house!
Patrick	Yeah. And it would take more than some masking tape to fix that guy.
Patrick	Ow! He bit me!
Patrick	That's just what I'd expect you to say. Dumb people are always blissfully unaware of how dumb they really are.
Patrick	It wasn't easy, dad.
Patrick	Mom! Dad!
Patrick	Hmm... ! Oh, hey! I think I know what that means. That's one of those sentence enhancers.
Patrick	Oh, mine too!
Patrick	Yeah, it's fancy talk.
Patrick	Oh, boy, my favorite!
Patrick	My turn!  Escalators!
Patrick	Ooooh...! You said number 11!
Patrick	Not if I tell first!
Patrick	What's going to happen to us?
Patrick	Agreed!
Patrick	Are you trying to move the ground? You'll never move it like that. You gotta get under...  neath it!
Patrick	How hard can it be?
Patrick	Well, at least I don't polish my fingernails.
Patrick	Holes! Holes!
Patrick	Oh, yes I am, Mr. SpongeBob SuperiorPants.
Patrick	Nuh uh. I'm eating my own dust!
Patrick	He wouldn't!
Patrick	Take that, yellow boy!
Patrick	Noooo! My name's... not... Rick!
Patrick	Yellow!
Patrick	You're my best friend ever.
Patrick	Right, you're a turkey!
Patrick	You are!
Patrick	Friend?  Friend...
Patrick	Yeah! E minor! All right! Yeah!
Patrick	Oh, yeah?! Well, he was  friend first!
Patrick	Me neither! This was a setup!
Patrick	I still didn't get any!
Patrick	Squidward!  Squidward!
Patrick	Squidward!
Patrick	Squidward!
Patrick	How pathetic.
Patrick	What's wrong with my idea?
Patrick	You said it, pal.
Patrick	So, how's that tan coming?
Patrick	I'm going to the snack bar.
Patrick	I'm drowning! I'm drowning!
Patrick	Help, help!
Patrick	Oh, sorry.
Patrick	Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?
Patrick	That's what we've been trying to tell you!
Patrick	What happened?
Patrick	Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!
Patrick	Maybe he's not a brother.
Patrick	All right!  Sorry, Squidward.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob!
Patrick	You're working at Pizza Castle now?
Patrick	I need my glasses.  Hmmm...  ...it's the mail truck!
Patrick	A starfish!
Patrick	Check.
Patrick	You got it!
Patrick	What?
Patrick	SpongeBob! My legs are frozen solid! You're going to have to cut them off with a saw!
Patrick	I could only hear the sound of our laughter.
Patrick	That's good. Now all you need is a box.
Patrick	We have a tape recorder box.
Patrick	Beep-beep.
Patrick	I hope he's not too down in the dumps today.
Patrick	Fighter pilot!  Dive bomb!
Patrick	Oh, don't worry about it. He'll find love one day.
Patrick	You got it set to  'M' for Mini when it should be set to  'W' for Wumbo.
Patrick	Look, SpongeBob's giant!  Can I be giant next?
Patrick	SpongeBob, this is star ranger, over.
Patrick	Go to your closet for a surprise.
Patrick	What's the problem?
Patrick	Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge, testing, testing.  Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing! Testing!  Testing!  Test. Do you read?!
Patrick	Start the boat.
Patrick	Okay, you're coming to your first turn.
Patrick	Cheating!
Patrick	How are we gonna do that?
Patrick	SpongeBob, I think she means it.
Patrick	Snowball fight? I want to play! I want to play!
Patrick	It's a snowball fight, remember?
Patrick	I was trying to tell you that I was choking on snow, but the snow melted and turned into water, and I drank all the water, now I'm better.
Patrick	Please?
Patrick	That's okay.
Patrick	And who am I?
Patrick	You got to have a fort, Squidward.
Patrick	He got you good, SpongeBob!  Take cover!
Patrick	Nope.
Patrick	Man, was I using mine wrong. How much?
Patrick	You tell 'em, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Barnacles!
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	Tubby?  Grr! Nobody calls me Tubby!
Patrick	You mean like a weenie? Okay!  May I take your hat, sir? May I take your hat, sir? May I...
Patrick	Yep, see you later.
Patrick	I'll take care of this!
Patrick	Let me see!  Hey, he's kinda cute. Uh-oh!  I think somebody's hungry!
Patrick	A donut?
Patrick	Wait! I think I might know the problem.  Yep, that's it alright.  Hold on just one second. There he is, good as new.
Patrick	Yeah! At least until it's old enough to be on its own! Oh, I wanna be the mom!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Alright! All this parenting stuff makes me hungry.  Hey Junior, how are you doing today?  SpongeBob?
Patrick	I'm goin' to work. I'm the dad, remember?
Patrick	Aw, gee, SpongeBob, I'd love to but I'm totally beat from work.
Patrick	Phew, another tough day!
Patrick	I'll get to it eventually...
Patrick	Hey, I'm missin' the coconut!
Patrick	Oh, that's not that much.
Patrick	No more foolin' around. From now on, I'm Super-Dad! I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time. So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal!
Patrick	Six o'clock.
Patrick	Oh, what a relief.  For a second there, I thought you were mad at me.
Patrick	I don't need this.
Patrick	You know, it's not as easy as it looks. Sometimes I gotta move the antenna, sometimes I lose the remote,  and sometimes my butt itches real bad!
Patrick	You know what that means?
Patrick	There's that stupid noise again!
Patrick	I guess he's all grown up!  Hey, what about Daddy?  That's my boy.
Patrick	Yeah... Let's have another!
Patrick	No way, SpongeBob, we're not getting paid to move stuff.
Patrick	Tarp ahoy!
Patrick	Oh. Now it's my turn!
Patrick	Oh, I know!  Two giant paint bubbles!
Patrick	Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!
Patrick	Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!
Patrick	Nope.
Patrick	Wait, SpongeBob! We're not cavemen!  We have technology!
Patrick	Wanna bite?
Patrick	We didn't do it on purpose!
Patrick	We're so sorry!
Patrick	WHOOOOOOOOOAAAAH!
Patrick	Fancy livin', here we come! La la la la, la!
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	Not 'babies!'
Patrick	Whoo! High five!
Patrick	Krabs!
Patrick	Ooohh.
Patrick	Waterballs! Waterballs!
Patrick	No! No! No! No!
Patrick	Ooh!
Patrick	La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la.
Patrick	We're waiting. We're waiting.
Patrick	Whoa, really?
Patrick	Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. We like to work.
Patrick	Hooray!/Yay!
Patrick	Oooohyeah.  Good night, Squidward.
Patrick	But Sandy!
Patrick	Eat or be eaten!
Patrick	We're both Squidward.
Patrick	"It's a ""lol-squid."""
Patrick	--white as snow!
Patrick	Wow!
Patrick	Okay...
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	Wrestle Camp! Wrestle Camp, Wrestle Camp, Wrestle Camp!
Patrick	Patty-cake, patty-cake, sailor man! Bake me a cake as fast...
Patrick	Yay! We're going to be heroes! We're going to be heroes!
Patrick	Reporting for duty!
Patrick	Okay!
Patrick	We're almost there!
Patrick	.
Patrick	Aaahhhhhhhh!
Patrick	Yes.
Patrick	Ooh!
Patrick	Chum Bucket, sludge bucket, highway fly away! Lilly liver, pizza giver, mashed potato, kelp tomato! All we are trying to say, is give Jellyfish Fields a chance! Ketchup bottle, net and goggle, tollbooth, rotten tooth, freeway plan, toast and jam, Mermaid Man, a garbage can! Citrus fruit, combat boot, give a hoot, gorilla suit! All we are trying to say is give Jellyfish Fields a chance! Plankton's eye, ham on rye! Larry's thigh, battle cry! ketchup squirt, long-sleeved shirt! Self assert, Hit the Dirt! Krusty Krab, smash and grab! Barg 'N' Mart! Grocery cart! All we are trying to say, is give Jellyfish fields a chance! C.E.O's! Gary's toes! Squidward's nose! Pantyhose! Rocking chair, wash and wear! Empty stare, Patrick's hair! Green trees, Sandy's fleas! Rise and shine, lemon lime! Out of time, squiggly line! Take a stand, hand in hand. All we are trying to say, is give Jellyfish Fields, a chance.  It's working, Patrick! They're booing the highway! Looks like our message has really gotten through to the people! Let's play a song while their hearts are open!  Hey, wait a minute. This is one of our fliers! They're pelting us with our own pamphlets!  what does this mean!
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	AAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!
Patrick	Squidward, please let us in!  Oh, heh heh.
Patrick	Hmmmmm.
Patrick	Whoo-hoo! Ha, ha! Whoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo!
Patrick	Hole in one!
Patrick	Anchovies!?  You are real ghosts! You are real ghosts!
Patrick	Again!
Patrick	Uh-oh.
Patrick	Huh-uh.
Patrick	Nooooo!
Patrick	Glove Universe?
Patrick	We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!
Patrick	The map, the map, gotta see it, gotta look at it.
Patrick	Uh-huh!
Patrick	Oh yeah.
Patrick	Uh-oh.
Patrick	Hey Sandy!
Patrick	One, two, three, four...
Patrick	Road trip!

Patrick	Step outside, we've got something for you to see!
Patrick	Jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing!
Patrick	Loud and clear trusted boy companion!
Patrick	This is the greatest day of our lives!
Patrick	It's still a mystery!
Patrick	We promise.
Patrick	"Mmm-hmm...  He said """"!"
Patrick	Squidward?!
Patrick	Squidward! Squidward, no, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, stop, please, please! Stop, Squidward! You can't join! You can't join! Can't join! You can't get in!
Patrick	Oooohhhh!

Patrick	Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!
Patrick	[the clock tolls, meaning that it's midnight. A little cardboard cutout of the Fisherman comes out of the clock and lowers his cardboard hook and catches a cardboard fish. It goes back in the clock]  [run to SpongeBob's door]
Patrick	Yeah!  We're going to Atlantis! We're going to Atlantis!
Patrick	Sure thing, Mrs. Puff!
Patrick	Sideburns.
Patrick	Ow, butt cramps!
Patrick	Nah, no, thanks. I had a late breakfast.
Patrick	E-Exit the... Exit the treedome?!
Patrick	Yeah. Nothing can scare us.
Patrick	You sure?  It's worse! They're kissing!
Patrick	Let's just cross that bridge when we burn it.
Patrick	Oh.  There.
Patrick	I sure hope so. (SpongeBob and Patrick look into window and sees Squidward, laughing)
Patrick	Uh... Nope,I don't see it. Kenny's really gotten into your head lately.
Patrick	Pickle? Wasn't me. IT'S ME!
Plankton	You'll never catch me, Krabs, not after I switch into maximum overdrive!  Hi-ya!  I knew I should have gotten the turbo.  Hear me Krabs! You'll take this Krabby Patty from me when you pry it from my cold, dead...
Plankton	Okay.
Plankton	That's right, Krabs. Now hand over the secret Krabby Patty formula!
Plankton	You just wait, Krabs! Next time I'll... ah, who am I kidding? At least I can go home to a wife who understands.
Plankton	And she's off, ladies and gentlemen.
Plankton	I like the sound of that. I'll canvas all the seediest lowbrow dives in town to find my minions. And I know just how to speak their language!  Felicitations, malefactors! I am endeavoring to misappropriate the formulary for the preparation of affordable comestibles! Who will join me!?
Plankton	I've been away from home longer than I thought.
Plankton	Yes, that's my first name.
Plankton	Good. Ahem, to continue.  Only you can bring honor...  ...and dignity...  ...back to the Plankton name.  For years, it has been my goal to acquire the secret formula for...  Aha!  Okay, that's enough!  Bottom line: we invade the Krusty Krab so I can steal the secret formula. What do you think?
Plankton	Attention Krusty Krab management! This is your better speaking.
Plankton	GRASS?!?
Plankton	Hot dog!  Yes. It's mine! The formula's mine. After all these years, it's finally mine!  Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J. Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!
Plankton	Eye.
Plankton	...A cup of love...!
Plankton	Drats! He's not collapsing from exhaustion, but with a little more pressure, the Sponge will crack like an egg , and I'll be there to feast on the goo of his shattered psyche.
Plankton	Come in, Mr. SquarePants. Please have a seat on the couch.  Now...  Let's unload all that harmful information in your little yellow head.
Plankton	I want you to close your eyes.  Tighter  Tighter  Too tight! Now, tell me what you see?
Plankton	Wait, where'd you get that piano?  We're trying something else. I'm going to say a word and I want you to say the first word that pops into your head. Ready?
Plankton	Bun.
Plankton	Tomato
Plankton	Since your mind has been resistant to every mental technique so far, I'm forced to resort to my most powerful method of curing you.
Plankton	Wake up!
Plankton	And so passes another sleepless night, haunted by my inability to steal even a single Krabby Patty.
Plankton	Does that include the Krabby Patty formula?
Plankton	See you in court, Krabs! Uh, I mean...  oh the pain! The deep-frying pain!
Plankton	Oww! My other arm!
Plankton	Upon entering said establishment, I found myself without any warning, slipping and finally falling onto a hard, unforgiving floor  that had been intentionally  covered with a viscous fluid.
Plankton	Do you own one?
Plankton	Uhh...uhh...uhh  I can't take it! Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!  Yippee! Finally it's mine!
Plankton	Oh, good, the lunch rush. Now that my ChumBot has dropped you into my clutches, you'll be forced to eat at the Chum Bucket.
Plankton	Karen?! You think I'm a twerp?
Plankton	Why did I ever install that nagging software?
Plankton	Why don't you have an 'off' switch?
Plankton	Oh, yeah...I am smooth.  Just dial the number and ask her to dinner. C'mon, you can do this.
Plankton	It was...just a lucky guess. I've admired you from afar for far too long, my angel. We must meet face-to-face.
Plankton	Excuse me, I can't reach my silverware!
Plankton	Well, I'm in the food service business. I'm a bit of a restaurateur. I'm the founder and owner of the Chum Bucket.
Plankton	Krabs!
Plankton	Boyfriend?
Plankton	Eugene.
Plankton	Your mother knows the Krabby Patty formula?
Plankton	Oh, Mrs. Krabs.
Plankton	Gasp![actually says the word]
Plankton	I don't believe this! You led me on!
Plankton	So, you decided to come crawling back to me, huh?
Plankton	SpongeBob, this role was made for me.
Plankton	Give it back!
Plankton	Morning, SpongeBob. Krabs. Beautiful day.
Plankton	Don't you get it, Krabs? I give up. I'm through competing with you!
Plankton	Well, there he is.  That's why I've decided to quit the restaurant business altogether, and turn the Chum Bucket into...  this!
Plankton	Guard away, my ex-enemy. I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career.
Plankton	Ah. A clean snow globe is a happy snow globe.
Plankton	Ah, Eugene. Stuck in your old ways.
Plankton	Look what you've done. This is my livelihood.
Plankton	You forgot something.  Can't you understand I've wasted so much time chasing after you? And now I have something that's mine. And it makes me happy.
Plankton	Hey.
Plankton	So, what's this about, Krabs?
Plankton	Thanks, Eugene. That means a lot to me.
Plankton	You...you're serious. Eugene, if I take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt.
Plankton	Pardon me, I've done nothing wrong.
Plankton	No, not another secret. And if there's a secret, I want to know about it!
Plankton	Just stick to the plan.
Plankton	Of course I do.
Plankton	Now we have to fix the roof. [winks]
Plankton	Wait, you forgotten...  I'm throwing in the towel, Krabs! All these convoluted plans are getting us nowhere. And to top it all off, I'm the only one that's taking the heat!
Plankton	Good luck.
Plankton	You? What about me? If anyone, I deserve to make a buck of selling this stuff.
Plankton	Well, don't be selfish.  Oh yeah.
Plankton	I don't know about you, [Plankton takes out a mini helicopter propeller] but I'm going back to what I do best. Stealing your recipe.
Plankton	I love being hated.
Plankton	You'll rue the day we were born, Krabs. I'll be back.  Oh, barnacles.
Plankton	Valuable customers coming through.
Plankton	Gently. Gently.
Plankton	I'm ruling their stomachs. And soon I'll be ruling their minds!
Plankton	I'm terribly sorry, Eugene, I couldn't hear you. Could you come closer? Maybe stand on the tile in front of you?
Plankton	Very touching, but completely false.
Plankton	But what about satisfying the customers?
Plankton	You'll regret this one day!  Ouch.  Our little squabble only got me part of the recipe.
Plankton	What's that music?
Plankton	You let it sit out too long. That's what did it! I'm taking the recipe and fixing it.
Plankton	Get out of my face!
Plankton	Go on, sir! Tell your buddies what you think!
Plankton	My life has been nothing but a long line of disappointments since we became enemies. All these years I've been trying to steal your formula. But I was really just trying to steal back our friendship.
Plankton	Now, Karen!  Back off, Rag Boy.
Plankton	Would you stop making all that racket?
Plankton	Secret mission, eh?  Don't you think I know what you're up to? You want to eat at the Chum Bucket without your boss knowing. Karen, we've got a customer!  I'll let you two look over the menu.
Plankton	Prune Danish?  What the...?  Destroy my lab, will ya, Krabs? Well, if it's war you want, it's war you'll get!
Plankton	Pointy-headed projectile on the port side!
Plankton	No, you idiot.
Plankton	Ha! The usual wager?
Plankton	That crusty old barnacle might keep me from the secret formula, but I'd like to see him serve a Krabby Patty when I'm done with this place.  Into every life, a little rain must fall, Krabs. its just business.  Well, maybe it is personal.  I'm touching your thermostat! I'm touching your thermostat!
Plankton	No! How is this possible? I freeze this place solid and he turns it into an ice rink. He's making more money than ever.
Plankton	I did it. I finally got a Krabby Patty.
Plankton	Better luck next time, SpongeBob.
Plankton	On the contrary, It is I who has you.
Plankton	That's right, Krabs. It was I who froze The Krusty Krab.  See?
Plankton	Okay, I get it. I get it. It's time to give this place a complete overhaul.  Whoa! Whoa!  I shouldn't have to subject myself to such menial labor.  Ah! This is a job for an imbecile!  Or two imbeciles.  Excuse me, gentlemen. I am sorry to bother you, but I'm having a bit of trouble with my abode. You see, I would like to paint The Chum Bucket to please my wife. But alas, I am too small and feeble.
Plankton	Oh, yes. I need you artistic vision. You, wouldn't want to disappoint my Karen, now would you?
Plankton	Let me show you something, SpongeBob.  I sure wish I could offer you a cold drink for all your hard work. But alas, my pipes are rusted shut.
Plankton	Perfect. Huh?  No! No! No! It's all wrong! Don't you know a thing about art? Gimme that brush!  Yes, yes, and yes.
Plankton	SpongeBob, how do you expect me to see out of a window that high?
Plankton	Really?
Plankton	Well, steal is such a strong word.
Plankton	Ha!
Plankton	Hmmm... perhaps a peppershaker was a bit obvious.
Plankton	Hey, I resent that!
Plankton	Hello! If you're done making a total fool out of yourself, I could use some help with this lock.
Plankton	and then that blasted sponge called the cops! That's just not cricket.  Now I'll never be a tyrannical overlord.
Plankton	Uh-huh.
Plankton	I don't wanna hear all your loony schemes, Karen. I've got work to do!
Plankton	Krabs! Nice diaper.  Come on, come on!  I've got it!
Plankton	Out of my way, Methuselah! You're old and useless.
Plankton	It'll take more time to explain than you have left.
Plankton	What?
Plankton	No, that thing! The ugly drippy smelly thing.
Plankton	That's an excellent idea. And I know just the guinea pig!
Plankton	My moment of triumph!  What the...?  Oh, gross! I command you to stop drooling on me!
Plankton	Ha, ha ha. Such a valiant desire - hehehe. The lost weapons of Atlantis - the most advanced of all time. As soon as this dopey song is done I plan to make them miiiiine!
Plankton	Cower to me fools! I have commandeered the most powerful weapon in the Atlantean arsenal! Now bow before the new king of Atlantis and prepare to taste my wrath!  Yeah! Huh? Uh, uh I mean, uh, prepare to taste my wrath!  Oh, you!  Prepare to taste my wrath!
Plankton	You haven't seen the last of me! When I get out of here I'll hunt you all down like a pack of--  Hey! Can't you read?  No flash photography!
Plankton	Stupid kid. Wait a minute, what's this?  Karen?  My own wife?!  Oh, how Krabs mocks me.
Plankton	I'm Down Here, Fellas!
Plankton	You sure do.  See?
Plankton	Oh, boy! Everyone in Bikini Bottom showed up! This is gonna be so sweet.
Plankton	Oh, for crying out loud!  Tell them you hate Krabby Patties!
Plankton	Oh, no. Those infernal Krabby Patties. Their grease-fried deliciousness could be enough to free Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
Plankton	Hey, everyone, I made Chummy Joes!
Plankton	Hello, little boy. Would you like a chum burger?
Plankton	Ah, come on, kid. You asked me that already. Now quit wasting my time!
Plankton	Someone should put you in a box floating down the river, Grandma!
Plankton	Now that those two are out of the picture, all of the customers will come running to me. [literally] This calls for drastic-er-est measures! [Plankton goes into the abyss] Okay, you bums, time for the second course; Chum Charges!
Plankton	No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You- You've got it all wrong, see... Hey!
Plankton	Banned? Then that means, my day of reckoning has come at last! I won, I tell you! I've won! And what better way than by default?
Plankton	Krabby Patty?!
Plankton	So, Mr. Krabs is operating under the table, huh? Well, two can play at that game!
Plankton	Darn it! Argh! Once again, so close and yet so far! When am I gonna- oh!
Plankton	I can't believe it! That fool Krabs hiring the blood relative of his best worker!  Well, that's the end of me.
Plankton	Well, that's just great.  Hey! It's my old guitar. I used to play it, when I was in that band, as a kid. Man, those were good times.  Okay everybody! One two one two three!  You know, I don't think I've had any good times.
Plankton	That's a real nice song.
Plankton	Oh, that's terrible. Krabs shouldn't stifle a true artist like you! Go ahead and sing your patty song uncensored!
Plankton	Songs?  Yes! And you can teach me your Krabby Patty songs!
Plankton	Greetings, fellow band-mates.
Plankton	Yes, perfect, now all we need are the lyrics. You know something personal. Maybe a secret you know, or a favorite recipe, hmm?
Plankton	It's my uh recording equipment.
Plankton	The Krabby Patty Formula's gotta be in here somewhere.  What's going-  I'm a failure.
Plankton	Oh, no, it's the cops. I can't let them see me!
Plankton	Give me that, you incompetent fool.  Yes, the Krabby Patty Formula is mine! Uh, I mean, we'll have a great time!  Now where does Krabs keep that formula?
Plankton	Well, at least I'm back to my old cell.
Plankton	You may win this time. She-hah-kazeek!  Well, this stinks.
Plankton	Oh, Karen, even though you're just a frigid machine, your circuits must be welling up with emotion at my latest achievement.
Plankton	Welcome one and all, to the first bi-annual big arena of annihilation!
Plankton	Enough dilly-dallying. Send out the blood sausages!
Plankton	Here, take this one. It's fresh and warm, like my hospitality.
Plankton	Ten dollars, or the fight's off!
Plankton	"Now, I've been waiting for 20 years to have the amount of customers Krabs sees everyday! And I won't let that be ruined because the show's ""boring"", or the food's ""inedible."" So sit down, enjoy the show and buy some chum!"
Plankton	Argh! I can't take it!
Plankton	A customer?  Our special today is chum...  ...balaya.
Plankton	You know how to induce thermonuclear fusion?
Plankton	Take the Krabby Patty?
Plankton	And?
Plankton	F is for fire that burns down the whole town, U is for uranium... bombs! N is for no survivors, when you-
Plankton	Wait, I don't understand this, I feel all tingly inside. Should we stop?
Plankton	Well, the really fun part was when we...
Plankton	What are you talking about?
Plankton	Oh, yes, but I'm saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies.
Plankton	I... I don't see anything.
Plankton	All right, it's true! I tricked you to get the Krabby Patty! But then you showed me friendship!  And now I realize... that's all I really wanted!
Plankton	"Oh, you mean the ""secret recipe"" I came up with?"
Plankton	Uh, no.
Plankton	Yes, it is a Krabby Patty.
Plankton	What is going on here?!
Plankton	What's the point? I haven't had a customer in years!
Plankton	You're kidding right?
Plankton	Well it's simple, finally someone came in who has good taste. And he's coming back tomorrow! Excuse me Karen, but I've gotta whip up some more.  Now, I wait. I wait until he returns.  I wait. I wait. I wait. I wait.
Plankton	You certainly did, didn't you?
Plankton	You bet 'ya.
Plankton	Oh my, this is amazing! At last, I've got my revenge!
Plankton	But of course loyal customer.  I'll see you later, loser. Much later!
Plankton	Would you hurry up with that Chum, Karen?!
Plankton	What do you think Krabs, baby? This time I caught you trying to steal my secret formula! Ironic, isn't it?
Plankton	That's right, Krabs! And you're going to have to keep looking when my customer comes in and pays me for my Chum!
Plankton	What's the deal, Karen?
Plankton	What? It's just obvious that i'm a complete failure, and wasted of a lower life form! Oh, woe is me!
Plankton	":  ""Plankton's Chum Made of Your Chums? The Chum Bucket serves your friends in more ways than one?""  What?!?  Who's to blame for this? Who?!?"
Plankton	There's nothing wrong with Chum Bucket fare. Why look! Here's a fresh batch of a delicious new chum sauce. It's called Spicy Chum Surprise.   Delectable!
Plankton	"Uggghhhh! How many times must I say it!? We don't carry Krabby Fries, we don't carry Krabby Kola, we don't carry Krabby Sauce, and we don't carry Krabby Patties!!! So if you want any of those things you're gonna have to go to the Krusty Krab which is located directly across the street!"""
Plankton	You know Karen, sometimes I wonder if you're here to help me run the Chum Bucket or just to make me feel like I'm two inches tall.
Plankton	Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me. Now where was I!?
Plankton	Oh Karen!
Plankton	Ha ha ha, that, my dear, is a T-119A Compumatic, the finest of its kind.
Plankton	And now Karen, the piesta  resistance.  Have you ever witnessed such marvelous machinery?
Plankton	You see! Plenty of reason to be using a hair dryer.
Plankton	Karen, do something! Quick! They're tearing each other apart! Just press a button or something!
Plankton	That's right! Now it's all clear! It's you that's been holding me back! In fact, if it weren't for your constant stifling, I'd have the whole world running for the safety of their mommies!!
Plankton	I said, does everybody understand!?!?!?
Plankton	Hey! Krabs, I wanna see you.
Plankton	Uhhh! Forget it!  Bring on the Boom Boom!
Plankton	Karen! You've come back to me!
Plankton	Hey, I could whip us up a little dinner, what do ya say?
Plankton	Oh, thanks for the help. Ya know, details like this can be very important to the customers.
Plankton	Look, are you gonna eat or not!?!?!
Plankton	Advertising?  I can't believe it took me so long to come up with this
Plankton	Sir, your head, it's on fire.  THE DRINK, USE THE DRINK!
Plankton	Whatever.
Plankton	Okay so it may take a little longer than a few minutes.
Plankton	Next!
Plankton	Sure you do. LOOK OUT! SHE'S GONNA BLOW!!!
Plankton	Gah! You're supposed to be coming up with witty catchphrases to keep that rabble out there happy!  Chum is Fum...We kinda got that one already.
Plankton	Hey Karen, check this out!
Plankton	Hmmmm....
Plankton	"NO! That's not it you FOOL! We need a new slogan! You need to come up with another genius catchphrase like ""Chum is Fum"" but different."
Plankton	You fellas look hungry, here you go!
Plankton	Is it too late for sorry?  D'OH!
Plankton	Hey! What are you?
Plankton	Oh no!
Plankton	Really? I accomplished something? What is it?
Plankton	Oh, that.  Yippee.
Plankton	Wha? SpongeBob?? Ahh...there's nothing wrong. Don't worry.  I'm...fine.
Plankton	What? Like a kidney?
Plankton	Loop?
Plankton	...uhh...
Plankton	Well we like to take long walks on the beach, and, uh, we like to talk about our dreams. Our dreams of conquering all of Bikini Bottom and become supreme overlords of all creation...  ...and to trample our enemies beneath our feet.
Plankton	Now that you mention it she does go ding, at least once a day.
Plankton	...me me meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  EEEEEEEEEEEEEE  EEEEEEEEE  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  EEEEEEEEEEE....
Plankton	Why are you so obsessed with my internal organs?
Plankton	Karen?
Plankton	I l...l...love you too!  So? Can I have my present now?
Plankton	Oh No! You unpluged the coffee maker, SpongeBob.
Plankton	Karen, what's wrong? Have you sprung a leak?
Plankton	No!
Plankton	It's a conspiracy, I tell you! A thousand and three times I've almost had that recipe, and a thousand and three times I've been launched by that Krabs! He celebrates eleventy-seven years of success,  I'm left with four score and forty fortnights of failure!  I give up, Karen. Krabs has won!
Plankton	Splat.
Plankton	You really think so?
Plankton	Yes, Ma'am!
Plankton	Uh, I didn't, uh... Okay fine. You caught me. You happy now?
Plankton	Yes? Go on.
Plankton	There's no one here. The Krusty Krab is empty. I've won!  The Krabby formula is mine.  It took eleventy-seven years, but I got it!  Oh, no.  No!  Oh, nuts.
Plankton	You know, this isn't so bad. Everyone looks like little ants from up here. Wait. Help.
Plankton	Ugh, what kind of wife...? We'll just see about that.
Plankton	Heh, heh, heh, at this rate, we'll have the formula before you can say...
Plankton	Shh! Can't you see I'm concentrating?  Yes! You see what happens when you let me make my own decisions? Now, maybe we'll get somewh-   What happened?
Plankton	Karen, please! I'm trying to process my emotions! ...Karen! I think I know how to push Krabs out of business we'll lure customers underground with this gorgeous scenery!
Plankton	Another order of Chumballs!  Huh?
Plankton	Sea turtles! He called it! He always was good with legal jargon.  Alright, Krabs, if you think it's fair to undercut my business, then I'm gonna undercut you!
Plankton	This is all your fault! I oughta boil and butter you for this!
Plankton	...Nearing the end...
Plankton	I'm way ahead of you, Krabs!
Plankton	Aha! Now time to get that formula!
Plankton	All the way from the bakery. But it will all be worth it when I finally get the Krabby Patty.
Plankton	Oh no! What's happening?
Plankton	What in Neptune's ocean is that repulsive thing?!
Plankton	Hope you like long showers, squirrel!
Plankton	Okay, Karen, wish me luck!
Plankton	No, Sandy is herself. No reason to be sus-pic-ious in any way, y'all.
Plankton	Please don't put your finger on it.
Plankton	Curse you, Krabs...!
Plankton	Yee-haw!
Plankton	There it is.
Plankton	What, nothin'!
Plankton	try it again! I'm makin' my move!
Plankton	My eye! This condiment is highly irritating to my eye!
Plankton	It is not! Business is just slow.
Plankton	Really?
Plankton	You're right. I'm such a failure.
Plankton	Right. Why didn't I think of that before?
Plankton	And just how am I supposed to attach it to Krabs' brain?
Plankton	No!
Plankton	It worked! I can see everything SpongeBob sees.
Plankton	That's it! I'm going somewhere else. [plugs back SpongeBob's eye plugs]
Plankton	Here it comes.
Plankton	"Ew. That's disgusting. Now, where do morons keep all their secrets?  Nope.  Doesn't this kid have any secrets Aha!  The library, where he keeps records of his every thought. All of his deepest, juiciest secrets.   In convenient alphabetical order. Look at that. ""Sounds that make Squidward upset""?"
Plankton	I sure did.
Plankton	The What?
Plankton	Coming dear.
Plankton	Sheh! It's almost like I got a personal visit from the Flavor Fairy!
Plankton	Well, well, well, now I do see what Krabs meant when he said two could play that game. But he's a bigger fool than he realizes if he thinks old Plankton it gonna take this one lying down!  Uhhh... Meh
Plankton	Oh no! Did somebody call the health inspector?
Plankton	I can't.
Plankton	Now what's this all about, anyway?
Plankton	Forget it. Even if I wanted to the Shelly Superhighway from being built, it would be impossible.
Plankton	People of Bikini Bottom- Today marks the new- STOP MURMURING!!  Thank you. And as I was saying, today marks the beginning of a new-  SHUT UP!!!!!!  As I was saying, today marks a new beginning for Bikini Bottom!  Now, its time to pave our way down the road to success!  Ah, I love the smell of hot tar in the morning! Yeah, baby!  Hey, you there! are you trying to get yourself crushed!?
Plankton	Oh sure!  Let me just wind my watch!
Plankton	WAIT! I'M COMIN' WITH YOU! [before Plankton can escape, the jellyfish grab him]NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! [jellyfish sting him] NOT THE EYE,' NOT THE EYE!!!!
Plankton	My highway! Stop, you can't do this!
Plankton	Another dud huh?
Plankton	Oh well, I have other ways of getting it when I need where is the formula Krabs?
Plankton	Clever, behind the painting ay Krabs?
Plankton	Ahhhhh! Call off your daughter Krabs! Call her off!
Plankton	Krabs had a whale!
Plankton	Holy, protozoa!  Karen! she's here! She got in!
Plankton	I swear! A whale was just in here. She was next to the transmutator. She was right here in this spot! Her mouth all frothy, her blowhole blowing!
Plankton	Hey! Get me out of here!
Plankton	What's the point of going on? I'll just be tortured for the rest of my life by that whale!  That's it. I'm done. The 4:15 bus should be here any time now.
Plankton	Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!
Plankton	Really?
Plankton	No, no. Thank YOU!
Plankton	The jig is up, Krabs. I know all about the suit, AND your secret fear!
Plankton	Why?
Plankton	Im kind of busy right now.
Plankton	: You once told me that this was your favorite flavor growing up as a child.
Plankton	:  Now, where were we?  Grandma, don't forget your teeth.
Plankton	:  Why, SpongeBob. Don't you recognize me?
Plankton	: It was certainly interesting, but I'd like to hear about your more affairs, like where you work, for instance.
Plankton	: Uh, sounds delightful. Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.
Plankton	: Well, uh...
Plankton	:
Plankton	: Antenna... What?! No, I...!
Plankton	:
Plankton	: SpongeBob, SpongeBob, up here!
Plankton	Oh, I feel better already.
Plankton	: Grandma, I can explain!
Plankton	EEEEEEOOOOOWWWWWWWW!!!!
Plankton	Krabs?! Why that- Well, he was just telling you a fish tail. There's no such thing as a Drain at the bottom of the sea. So go on, scram, shoe, get outta here!
Plankton	We just didn't want you to make the same mistake we made.
Plankton	This is too easy. Karen, I'm off on a business trip. Don't up wait for me, baby.
Plankton	Oh, come on, I just got here. I couldn't have stolen ityet.
Plankton	I told you I wasn't lying.
Plankton	Anyway, since you didn't steal the key, then you'd obviously submit to a search of your cabin.
Plankton	Me, three.
Plankton	Looks like you've got a lot on your mind.
Plankton	Hee hee hee hee hee. Ha ha ha ha ha.  Come to papa!  At last, my day of triumph has come! Again.
Plankton	Checkmate, Krabs!  Ow.
Plankton	There it is! The one element that can turn this lonesome bucket of steel into a bustling world famous eatery!
Plankton	Finally, the Krabby Patty secret recipe!
Plankton	What? I thought you said you read lips!
Plankton	Okay, now what'd he say?
Plankton	"I know that! Wait... oh, he said, ""What?""."
Plankton	Look I'll just cut to the chase. Do you have a dirty shell and hate bath time?
Plankton	have a pleasant stay! Bon Voyage!  If my reasoning is correct, as SpongeBob's pet I'll get to witness Krabby Patties being made from scratch! Then I can copy the formula, and destroy Krabs once and for all!
Plankton	Curses! Oh, I mean... meow?
Plankton	Pet hospital! But what about the fresh batch of Krabby Patties?! I mean, meow!
Plankton	Please! No more!
Plankton	But what?
Plankton	Yes, Spongefool come back with the formula and victory will be mine!
Plankton	Finally! The day has come!
Plankton	This is no ordinary vegetable steamer, Karen, my computer wife. It's my latest invention! And isn't she a beauty. Meow.
Plankton	Hehehehe!
Plankton	Of course it's me, you moron.
Plankton	Is that good?
Plankton	Do you really like it?
Plankton	Heh. Yes, that's what I meant.
Plankton	A test monkey?  I've never had a test monkey before!  There is some mad scientist in you after all! Muhahahaha!  Ok, we really have to work on your evil laugh.
Plankton	Ok. Let her rip!
Plankton	Two!
Plankton	Fools! I played them like a 32 bit synthesizer! Muhahaha! Now where's that formula?  The formula is gone?
Plankton	Wow, you must've snapped Krabs.  The Krabby Patty formula is finally mine!  What happened?
Plankton	Ooo... Krabs and I are bitter enemies!
Plankton	Another restaurant. Looks like Krabs has some real competition, huh. Interesting.
Plankton	Hey, stealin' recipes it my shtick. You haven't got a chance against me.
Plankton	You're a loser Krabs.
Plankton	Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  Ow! Owuhhh.
Plankton	Stand aside, restaurant critic coming through!
Plankton	That fool Krabs, he blew it again!  Now to steal the recipe.  Aha! There it is, and it isn't even guarded.  Huh?
Plankton	I agree.  This is a horrible idea.
Plankton	Oh, no you don't!
Plankton	One tablespoon listening. Two tablespoons...understanding? Mix ingredients thoroughly. Fold in warm heart. Sounds like a recipe for cannibalism.
Plankton	We should do this more often, Krabs.
Plankton	Chum Nuggets here! Going fast! Get 'em while they're cold! Get 'em while they're running! Looks like Krabs' drive thru is really paying off, for me!  Oh no...not again. .
Plankton	Zap!  I see you.  Zap!
Plankton	Here kitty, kitty, kitty.
Plankton	SpongeBob!
Plankton	And with the prize money, I'll topple your restaurant and empire once and for all!
Plankton	Hehehehe!  Yooooouch!  So the safe isn't[???]of flame, eh? It seems as though I'll have to get a little more DESTRUCTIVE!  Ahem! I meant DESTRUCTIVE!
Plankton	Perhaps I misjudged the skill on that one.  That does it! Listen up safe, I will steal your content, even if I have to tear you apart.  Bit by bit.  Molecule by molecule.  Atom by atom!  Uh-oh.
Plankton	Krabs! Why aren't you frozen under the barren tundra?
Plankton	: Uh... well I'm sure my loving wife is not a party to this angry mob. You-you've gotta help me here Karen!
Plankton	Okay Eugene. I'll just sign the surrender treaty first.  Oops, here I go. Hahahaha! Looks like I've out smarted you again aye fools?
Plankton	That's right Krabs and if you're thinking of busting out, mind the giant vat of fry grease beneath you.
Plankton	I can practically taste those Krabby Patties now!
Plankton	He's still doing it, Karen. He's Karen?
Plankton	Too late!
Plankton	You do?
Plankton	Yes, itnot buying that one either, huh?
Plankton	Well, that's a fine way to treat a family member.
Plankton	Music?
Plankton	I've never been sure of anything, but I am sure of this: play for me. Fill my ear sockets with the strains of your sweet, sweet magic.
Plankton	It's delightful!  Bravo!  Encore, encore! Yes, yes, bravo, bravo! Whoo-hoo!
Plankton	Enjoying it? Why, I'm enjoying it so much, it's making me want to... it's making me want to...
Plankton	Hooray!
Plankton	And you've been working there for a pretty long time, haven't you?
Plankton	You work in the same place for 20 years and you've never noticed ingredients of the sole item on your menu? Cut the comedy, octopus! I want that formula and I want it now!
Plankton	Aha! Okay, fish-flute, time to play a little avant-garde. Guardrail, that is.
Plankton	Wait a minute, I've never seen this instrument before in my life.
Plankton	And diabolical conspiracies?
Plankton	AAAAGHHH!!
Plankton	You might as well hand over that secret formula right now, 'cause once you shove off it's as good as mine! Ha ha ha! What in sea-bottoms?!
Plankton	Why don't I bump those vacation settings up a smidge?
Plankton	Gotta rethink that vacation algorithm when we get back.
Plankton	There he is, that swabby fool. Your turn now, Krabs.
Plankton	Very funny, Karen. Perhaps you should of married a pile of cheese.  That's it!
Plankton	I'm so exhausted! How's it going, honey?
Plankton	Whew, that was close.
Plankton	AGGHHHH!
Plankton	Ahem, good day sirs, I would like to pilfer your, I mean, purchase a Krabby Patty.
Plankton	Ah ha ha ha ha!  Choke on that, you big..omf!
Plankton	35 left, 25 right, and finally, 4 left. Open says me!  Hey, what gives? I was looking right at the combination, why isn't it opening?
Plankton	Oh Karen, if only you could see the way I do.
Plankton	Success! Uh oh, that ain't good. No, no, no, no no no n n n no! I can see every-
Plankton	It's not love is it? Cause you know I hate that stuff.
Plankton	Hey SpongeBob, want to hear a sad story?
Plankton	Yes, let's hurry up and get it over with!  Mommy! Here comes the pain!  That wasn't so bad. Uh oh, here we go.  Eureka!
Plankton	I thought I was going to steal something. Can't imagine why. So, I'm just enjoying this lovely day!
Plankton	Nonsense, You're imagining things.
Plankton	Uhh...
Plankton	Such lovely destruction!
Plankton	Unbelievable! I've committed another selfless act. This eye is taking over! But I must stay strong and concentrate on swiping that Krabby Patty formula.  What's this? It's the Krabby Patty formula! Krabs must have lost it.
Plankton	Why didn't I run off with it? Why didn't I run off with it? Because that would be stealing!
Plankton	The Chum Bucket's been invaded. I'll never surrender, Never!
Plankton	So, what have you got for me today? Huh?  No Krabby Patty in sight.  What? What's this? Looks like a chewed-up Krabby Patty. A perfect sample from which to rebirth engineer a whole Krabby Patty!  Thanks, Eugene. You just made my job a whole lot easier.
Plankton	AAAHH!!!  What's with the police?! It's just a bag of garbage!  What's going on?
Plankton	Wait, what?  Hey, keep your hands where I can see em'!  Ok you two, against the wall!  That's it. Nice and slow.  You gotta help me! Ever since I left the Krusty Krab, I've had all kinds of heat on me! It's so bizarre! Normally, when I steal something from the Krusty Krab, it's Krabs who chases me not a bunch of cops. So if you know what's going on, start talking or else you're gonna answer with the spoon, see!
Plankton	You mean hold onto it until it's really worth something?
Plankton	Not only that, you're an accomplice to the crime, yeah.
Plankton	Believe it, Man Boy!
Plankton	Okay, so I didn't invent the concept, but I have improved upon it by removing the only obstacle to chum's success!
Plankton	That's the spirit, people. Step on up, but please take your time and be orderly. I wanna savor this whole putting Krabs out of business. Business.
Plankton	Yeah, I suppose you right, Karen.  Free Krabby Patties! Step up, step up, you'll never get this chance again, folks!
Plankton	Krabby Patties, anyone?
Plankton	Don't worry, Karen, i'll be here at lunch time. My mission here is accomplished.  What the...?!
Plankton	What's this supposed to be?
Plankton	Karen, I want you to meet my new computer wife.
Plankton	Well, I had to cut cost somewhere.
Plankton	And why did I outfit her with a molecular re-arranger ray?
Plankton	Ha! Karen 2, I knew you were special the moment I laid eye on your motherboard. Goodbye Karen Classic.  Hello Karen 2.
Plankton	Yes I suppose that's true. All right I got this.  What's  doing here? Karen, working at the Krusty Krab? What the?!
Plankton	Take me home, baby...
Plankton	I had a reality check, that's what happened.
Plankton	Hey.  What? You can't do that. It's not fair.
Plankton	And I'm both of those things. You have to let me guess now,  Krabs.
Plankton	...And one.
Plankton	Yes!
Plankton	What show?
Plankton	"Is this part of  ""the show?"""
Plankton	Oh, bravo. Bravo. Why does the puppet get to eat a Krabby Patty and I don't? And why aren't you in the kitchen cooking my patty?
Plankton	Okay, okay. I will.  I bid you good day, sir.
Plankton	Karen, quick. You gotta cut this Krabby Patty out of me, stat.
Plankton	Wait, come back. Oh, come on, Karen. What happened?
Plankton	Sure thing, fruitcake! Here you go!
Plankton	Sorta surley?
Plankton	How's your dander? Is it up?
Plankton	What's all the racket? What do you know? The Jerktonium seems to work on these jerks. Very interesting.
Plankton	Drat! That square-head's gonna throw my whole naughty to nice curve right off! I guess it's time to introduce Plan B.  Hahahahaha! Plan B, meet Karen. Now go, my automated agent of naughtiness, go and destroy SpongeBob's good name!  Huh? Oh yeah.
Plankton	Uh-oh.
Plankton	Yeah, see how you like it, Krabs!
Plankton	But I haven't even sauteed it yet. Whatever you say.
Plankton	Not the napkins!!! ()
Plankton	This looks suspicious.
Plankton	You are moving!!
Plankton	Oh yeah!? WellI'm gonna put together a....uh...a petition of customers signatures.
Plankton	Hey, get lost! I'm the only one that weeps around here.
Plankton	You just got a steel, sir. You'll get many villainous years out of that little number.  I'll forget this restaurant nonsense, Karen. I should've opened a yard sale business years ago.  Step up, fishes. Every evil invention is price to move!
Plankton	['Everyone crowds around him.][holding a dollar][holding a piece of paper attached to a clipboard]
Plankton	Bring it on! Bring the destruction!
Plankton	Come on! Let's do this! I wanna see some destruction!  I think I've seen enough.
Plankton	You want what?
Plankton	Well, it's your funeral.
Plankton	Don't worry.  Karen?  No I don't have it. Why do you even bother asking!?  Yeah, yeah...Look! Send over my killer-death robot would you?  No, the other one.  I love you too snookums...Help's on it's way!  Behold! Your champion!
Plankton	I'm not sure I like where this is heading...
Plankton	I'm only helping you out so I can get back to robbing you blind!
Plankton	Come on! Let me out!  MOMMY!!!  Come on! Open up!  HELP!!! GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!
Plankton	SpongeBob?! What in the sea shell are you doing here?!
Plankton	"So honey? Is ""you know what"" inside?"
Plankton	Karen, you got to get me out of here!
Plankton	Wait a second! I didn't say you could-
Plankton	I say I'm Plankton blast it!
Plankton	Now let me get this straight, you low-lives respect me?
Plankton	Yeah, I can see why you're still in jail. THINK, people! We need a plan!
Plankton	You ever tried eating it?
Plankton	Listen up reprobates! Chum requires specialized ingredients of the highest quality!
Plankton	Organic filler.
Plankton	Chum! Detonator! Is this detonator made out of soap?
Plankton	What in the name of electrolysis!?
Plankton	Yes! With my new gang of vicious convicts, you're no match for me now Krabs! Fellow jailbirds, bring me the Krabby Patty formula!
Plankton	Sorry Krabs! Nothing can stop me now!
Plankton	Infiltration achieved. Phase one, complete.  Now for phase two.  Sabotage!
Plankton	Oh, just picking up one of these.  Not that you'd know what it is.
Plankton	Well, you could come over and check it out.
Plankton	These are nothing compared to......the majestic SizzleMaster!
Plankton	Enough, my sarcastic wife. Enough to gain SpongeBob's trust, then steal the Krabby Patty formula right from under his dumb yellow nose!  Now to tune in SpongeBoob.
Plankton	You know, SpongeBob, there's a much faster way to do this.
Plankton	Leave it to me, kid.
Plankton	How about you take me back to your place tonight? I mean, I could help you around the house.
Plankton	It's not like it's actually me touching it, so...
Plankton	That's no problem, buddy.  Hey, why don't you take a seat while I get to work for you?
Plankton	Yes! Phase five is finally complete! Time to kick phase six into overdrive!  Yes, burn patties, burn!
Plankton	Yes! Ye-e-es.
Plankton	I had no idea this stuff was approved for restaurant use.
Plankton	Chum! Get your red, hot chum here! What's the deal? According to my algorithm,  beach-goers should be famished  and looking for a treat. A treat like chum! Hello? It's perfectly edible, people!  Oh, come on, man! This is my livelihood!
Plankton	Dangerous?
Plankton	That's great, sweetheart.
Plankton	That's it, Karen! The goo bubble must be stuck at the bottom. We just have to get down there. Karen, cut the power to the entire ship.  Yes!  Look, there it is! Karen, fire up the engine power.  With my mechanical clam digger, I'll crack open this goo-cano easy as a clam! Which is what it was built for, so... You know, that makes sense.  Yes! Yes! Bubble forth, my gooey wrath!  And now to get the ding-dang out of here!
Plankton	Let's just say I've got big plans for this little bubble.  Now, if you'll excuse me I have to go.
Plankton	Oh, dear, I guess you've got me. Oh, wait a second--  No, you don't!
Plankton	Cause if you don't,  I'm gonna pop this disgusting thing and destroy Bikini Bottom!  As you can see, I projected the blast radius of this goo-bomic balloon and it's gonna cover pretty much everything in town.
Plankton	Eh, not again.
Plankton	Okay, where were we? Oh, yeah!
Plankton	"Now to see what's inside a Krabby Patty! ""Just one ingredient:...""  Darn it, Krabs!  Ow."
Plankton	Uh, what do you mean? I'm having my company picnic. This is our spot.
Plankton	Those are my new hired, Simmy and Tally. Just look at them tossing the disk around.
Plankton	The cotton candy machine, hot roasted peanuts, games of chance, bottles you can knock over to win a prize, the world's most exciting roller coaster, a deep fryer for delicacies...
Plankton	You were saying, Krabs?
Plankton	This is working far better than I planned! With Krabs as my employee, I can order him to give me the Krabby Patty formula and the Krusty Krab will be no more!
Plankton	Uh oh.
Plankton	You'll see.  You'll all see! The future site of the Chum Bucket Mega Bucket must be clear to these cretinous beachgoers. But it's becoming increasingly obvious. I can deny it no longer!  I am small. I need someone big to clear the beach for me. I need...  SpongeBob!
Plankton	SpongeBob! Would you do that for me?
Plankton	Yes. You just have to learn to be more assertive. And I can show you how.
Plankton	No, no, be assertive!
Plankton	Listen, you! My friend's got something to say!
Plankton	No!  I'll show ya how! Hey, pencil neck!  Yeah, you, slither over here!  Surrender that ice cream cone or every waking moment for you will become a swirling torrent of pain and misery!
Plankton	Whatever.
Plankton	SpongeBob, you'll never get it right! Tell that guy you know karate and you'll tie him in a knot if you don't get your metal detector back!
Plankton	What?
Plankton	Yes, my plan is beginning to work! They're leaving the beach!  SpongeBob, that was wonderful! Is that an all-over tan?
Plankton	Breaking your wind!
Plankton	Haven't you figured it out, SpongeBob? Nice guys finish last. Only aggressive people conquer the world!
Plankton	Forget about that. I just can't take so much kindness in one sitting!  Need hatred.
Plankton	No! Come back!
Plankton	Well, if you love money so much,  why don't you  it?
Plankton	...scam you out of your secret formula, that is. Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Plankton	Uhhhh... Teen Talk, Teen Talk...  Ah. Girls like shoes.
Plankton	Ugh... Uhh... Uhh! Who knew Eugene was so light on his crab legs?
Plankton	No, no, I'm not Plankton  I'm Cashina, you're blushing bride. I.. uh... uh... Am I blushing?
Plankton	You're crazy! I'm out of here, and one day, the formula will be mine! Mark it.
Plankton	Why don't you lay your whole body down? That glass is big enough.
Plankton	No more punch for you! You don't look so good, SpongeBob. I suggest you take the day off tomorrow.
Plankton	"""Se-cret Form-ula"""
Plankton	What are you doing here!? You said you would take today off.
Plankton	Hey, SpongeCopy. Good to see ya.  Have you learned the secret formula yet?
Plankton	Now where was I? Oh yeah, I saved SpongeBob digital DNA. []
Plankton	You see, this is why I never had children.
Plankton	They all know the formula!
Plankton	I was afraid of that. I thought I'd save some money by using cheap toner.
Plankton	Wait no! [] []
Plankton	Wait, are you a copy?! Quick! What's the formula?!
Plankton	Yeah, you're pretty annoying. Well, you can stomp on me now if that's you want.
Plankton	Fortune cookies at the Krusty Krab, aye? Well, Eugene, I have a prediction too. You are in for an epic fail supreme with extra cheese!
Plankton	No! Fortune cookies. And Krabs is raking it in right now because all of his fortunes are actually coming true?! So...
Plankton	Enjoy your new fortune cookies, Krabs!
Plankton	Just wanted to borrow a cup of grease Eugene. I'll come back later, ciao!
Plankton	Finally!  No!  Ah-hah.  I have had enough! Get out of my restaurant you mindless sheep! I wrote those fortunes,  they were fakes, don't you get it?! Now all of you out!
Plankton	"""You will go on a long voyage where you will get everything you deserve.""  Hey!"
Plankton	Pfft, never happened.
Plankton	What do you mean, $1.99? You're not gonna step on me? I've got the secret formula, you know.
Plankton	I'm ready, I'm ready! Ready to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula! Prepare to initiate plan number... hmmm... number. What's the number? Oh well. Who cares?
Plankton	Out of my way, pinheads! Move it, move it, move it!  Hey there, snazola! I'm about to show you the advantage of not having a nose. Say hello to... Mr. Stinky!
Plankton	What? The old safe in the safe routine?
Plankton	Hey, there.
Plankton	Yeah. Gotta keep that hair clean and in a safe place.
Plankton	My leg!
Plankton	How many delicious boxes can I put you down for? If you order ten boxes, I'll qualify for my bottom-dweller badge. If you order a hundred boxes, I'll get my bling-bling badge. You know, you should hide these from your roommate. She'll eat all of them.  If you show me your best hiding place, I'd be happy to help.
Plankton	Hey, this snail litter tastes better than pineapple.  Now, where is that secret formula?
Plankton	Hello!
Plankton	Nope, nope, nope.
Plankton	Of course! What a fool I've been!
Plankton	Ah, my head. Oh, I must be in the center of the shell.  What's that?  This is it! Just like I thought! It was hidden here all the time! The secret Krabby Patty formula! It's beautiful!
Plankton	I've finally got the formula! It's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine! Open the sparkling apple juice, Karen! Daddy's bringing the bacon home! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!
Plankton	One swab from the inside of his cheek should do it.
Plankton	I told you to turn off that laugh track. And if you must know, I made sauce.  But when I add Patrick's DNA to it, it'll become Salsa Imbecilicus.
Plankton	Oh no.
Plankton	Shut up, dweeb!
Plankton	Did you finish my homework for me, nerd?
Plankton	Somethin' smells good!
Plankton	What?! If I knew education worked like that, I would have bought a diploma years ago!
Plankton	Rook to king four.
Plankton	Why don't we just destroy him and get it over with?
Plankton	I forgot the secret Krabby Patty formula, Mr. K. Would you remind me again?
Plankton	Lost your job you say? I might be able to help you, if you can do something for me.
Plankton	You're on your own, worm boy.
Plankton	Ehh...  No, I didn't! Can't you see I'm working on my new molecular analyzer?  Now all I need is the smallest molecule of a patty and the formula will be mine!
Plankton	Stupid? Your new screensaver is stupid and it makes your processor look fat!
Plankton	I wasn't taking to you, idiot!  Pain!  Okay, Karen, fun is fun, but it's time to let me back in. Come on, I really need to use the potty!
Plankton	Then can I just use your bathroom?
Plankton	Whew! Much better. Thanks for letting me use your bathroom.
Plankton	Oh, forget this!
Plankton	I don't know, I was just doing the same things I always do.
Plankton	What is that dimwit doing here?
Plankton	Whoa!
Plankton	Easy!
Plankton	What? What's wrong with my antennas?!
Plankton	Brother.
Plankton	Sure it was. And I know just how to do it.
Plankton	This is going so great, SpongeBob! Karen is totally jealous!
Plankton	I never knew what love was until I met you.
Plankton	Of course I did.  I'd do anything for you, baby, even hang out with this moron.
Plankton	Down here, idiot! I want to strike fear in the hearts of other drivers. You got something terrifying in that wand for me, SpongeBob?
Plankton	Ouch!
Plankton	Actually, yes, that is true. I've got it all worked out.  First I break into the safe, and...  Huh? Wait, is this live?
Plankton	I reckon that classified taste mixture will be in my hands directly.
Plankton	Urrgh!
Plankton	Urchins!
Plankton	Whee!  Come to daddy, patty!
Plankton	A new life in a new town!
Plankton	And so begins my retirement!
Plankton	Oh, my pretty. You'll be my best friend from now on.  Retirement is mine! Mine! Mine!
Plankton	Because I'm a decoy look-alike robot!
Plankton	Krabs? SpongeBoob? W-w-why aren't you in Dullsville?
Plankton	I, Plankton, with my superior intellect,  devised a plan to crush the Krusty Krab once and for all! If people won't come to the Chum Bucket, I will bring the Chum Bucket to the people! Behold! The receptacle of your doom, Mr. Krabs! Wait, this isn't-  Mommy!
Plankton	(dancing and singing to real tune) I'll rule the world, and everyone; you will bow down to me!
Plankton	Season's beatings, underlings!
Plankton	I don't know anymore!  It seems like all she does lately is nag, nag, nag, nag!
Plankton	Nooo! Well I have to admit there something about her. When I look into her screen, it's like I am falling in love all over again. What can I say Karen, baby I am crazy about ya'!
Plankton	Greetings, it is I, Plankton! And there's something I gotta get off my chest.  I'm worried that my evil laugh isn't evil enough.
Plankton	Mmm. There might be something there, but let me try one more.
Plankton	My Evil Genius Video Diary by Sheldon J. Plankton.  Greetings. It is I, Plankton!  I'm sorry. I'm not myself today.  It's just the world knows me as an evil villain...
Plankton	Yippee.
Plankton	What's the matter, man?
Plankton	Anytime, pal.
Plankton	Oh, uh, just this.  Bullies are so predictable.
Plankton	Ouch!
Plankton	I'm allergic to Chrysanthemums!
Plankton	Hey, watch where you're going you...
Plankton	Krabs!
Plankton	Your boss, your ruler, your master!
Plankton	I'll never get that formula with that pest Krabs popping in and out like that. I've got it! I've been saving this for a rainy day.  It looks like an ordinary penny... because it  an ordinary penny! That fool Krabs is too greedy to ignore you, my little pretty.
Plankton	Coin-operated self-destruct? Not one of my better ideas.   Ouch.
Plankton	Curses! It's not fair. Krabs is being interviewed by Perch Perkins, and I've never even had one customer!
Plankton	Z?
Plankton	Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Plankton	Stupid kid.
Plankton	Plan Z. I love Plan Z.
Plankton	Anything for you, Perch.
Plankton	Karen, baby, I haven't felt this giddy since the day you agreed to be my wife.
Plankton	That's right, Squidward.  And there's a free bucket helmet with every purchase. Care for one?
Plankton	Seize him, slaves!
Plankton	Now, is that really necessary?
Plankton	Welcome to Air Plankton! Please put your seat backs and tray tables up as we're now approaching our final destination.
Plankton	Well, Krabs, you're certainly in a pickle now!
Plankton	I'll take one secret formula...  ...to go.  Oh, barnacles! I'm out of gas?  Well, I'm not through yet. I've got something that will make you hand over that formula: something you can't resist.
Plankton	Here.  Take it!  You've taken everything else. Why not?!
Plankton	Uh-oh.  That ain't good.
Plankton	I-I don't know! It just disappeared!
Plankton	Knock-Knock jokes? I can do this all day, Krabs.
Plankton	Well, that's stupid, but how is it torture?
Plankton	I had it right in my greedy little mits, and then: poof! And now it's gone. Gone forever! Oh, I was so close to gaining the people's respect/fear.
Plankton	Oh...
Plankton	What's going on around here?
Plankton	Well, what do we do now?
Plankton	Tie 'em work.
Plankton	Work.
Plankton	Wait, what are you doing?
Plankton	Come on, SpongeBob. Let's get out of here!
Plankton	Why are you running?
Plankton	Well, yeah, looks like they're gonna have to change the name of Bikini Bottom to Dirty Bottom  right SpongeBob?
Plankton	There you are, feel comfy?
Plankton	Ew! It's so sweet in here. I think my eyeball is getting a toothache.
Plankton	What? No! That's crazy talk!
Plankton	Don't act so innocent! You know what I was up to. That's why you're pretending not to know the formula.
Plankton	MAYBE I DON'T WANNA BE ON A TE-AM! YOU THINK OF THAT?!
Plankton	Wait a minute, hold that thought.  Now back up.
Plankton	If we build a time machine, we can go back to before the formula disappeared. Before society broke down. Before we became the hunted.
Plankton	Now was that really necessary?
Plankton	We'll never get in, the door's locked.
Plankton	Why don't  boost  up instead?
Plankton	Now just reach over and grab it.
Plankton	Uh, uh. Once upon a time, there was a big, fat, pink idiot who went to sleep. The end!
Plankton	You'll get used to it.
Plankton	Installed!  I did it!
Plankton	Well, Karen. I know I've taken you for granted all these years and I... I just wanted to say... I'm glad you're on my te-am.
Plankton	According to my calculations, we've only gone 4 days into the future.
Plankton	We don't even know what we're even watching for.
Plankton	I'm you from the future.
Plankton	No!
Plankton	Hey, hurry up over there!
Plankton	So  what teamwork is. All those years, I tried to make you mine and I finally did it. I mean,  did it!
Plankton	Of course you didn't! 'Cause you got cotton candy for brains!  No, seriously, he really does.
Plankton	Note to self: Never stow away in a gym sock.
Plankton	Hey, I'm just putting things back the way they were.
Plankton	Hahahaha!
Plankton	The beach?!  I hate this already. Nobody goes to the beach anymore. Eeh, I'm Eugene Krabs, Listen to him yammer on it's amazing he got past the 3rd grade the big dunce ...  Ooh! A Krabby Patty! I should be recording thisWhere did I put that camera?  Once again, foiled by my own brain. Thanks a lot, brain, you really came through!
Plankton	Yeah that's right, Capsize them. Look at that seastar, he got it on his face. That's unusual for an invertebrate.
Plankton	Beach-combing, long-haired surf dimwits. Not my neighborhood, i'll tell ya that.
Plankton	"Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! They almost got nailed by those boards. Hey that's a good one, i'm gonna write that down. ""Nailed, by, those, boards."" That's pretty good. I'm writing a joke book full of zingers, stingers and one-liners, it's called ""Plankton's Punch Lines."" Here's another on, ""If someone slips on a banana peel, you could say, well I guess he didn't find that a-peeling!""  It's the ""peel"" part that gets them. That's called a  That kind of wise-cracking makes everyone lose they're minds with laughter just so long enough so i can steal the formula. Speaking of which, How come they have a Krabby Patty in a while--"
Plankton	Oh this guy's a peace of work.
Plankton	Yeah, yeah, let 'em have it, Dutchie! Give him a lightning bolt in the face!   Oh, now you're talking. What are you waiting for, ghost boob? Give Krabs the old heave-ho! Seriously, the Dutchman can't hear me.  Okay, look, if a powerful ghost can't destroy Krabs at his most desperate moment, what is this world coming to?! If I was in this scene, I would have Krabs on a spit by now, and I'd have the Krabby Patty in my hands.
Plankton	KRABS?!?!?!?! I thought he was destroyed.
Plankton	People seem a little more brotherly!
Plankton	What kind of cold, heartless person would break apart such a loving relationship?  I would!
Plankton	Perhaps you don't understand. You work for me now  and as your new boss, I command you to make me a patty this instant, or I'll be forced to remove your brain and implant it in my robot chef!  So get cooking.
Plankton	Hi!
Plankton	You got it!  Well it wasn't easy, but here it is! One old frying grill. How about we try it out?
Plankton	Here?
Plankton	Don't cry, SpongeBob! I'll show you it's much better working for me! Is there anything that old skinflint Krabs wouldn't let you have?
Plankton	How about those patties?
Plankton	Good one, SpongeBob. But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?
Plankton	Don't back sass me!
Plankton	Wait! I command you make me a Krabby Patty!
Plankton	It's a deal! I cheated anyway.
Plankton	You'll pay for this Krabs!
Plankton	Acquaintances?
Plankton	It's a gift! A gift from a friend.  Friends give each other gifts. And tomorrow is my birthday.  And you know what I'd like more than anything in the whole wide world? .
Plankton	Oh, I'll get a Krabby Patty and you're gonna hand-deliver it to me personally! You weak-minded fool!
Plankton	I have you now!
Plankton	Nonsense. You never liked me anyway. You wouldn't even come to my birthday party!
Plankton	Don't remind me. Brace yourself SpongeBob, this is my lab!  And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player?
Plankton	Mmm...
Plankton	Well, this stinks.
Plankton	Do instruments of torture count?
Plankton	Oh yeah?! Well, I smell...
Plankton	Are you ready to do or die, Krabs?
Plankton	That's where you're wrong, Krabs, for I too have a champion.
Plankton	And... stop! Perfect.
Plankton	...this huge guy who is carrying the real contestant...
Plankton	He's plotting your downfall right now!
Plankton	Now get out there!
Plankton	Almonds? Curse him, that's good. But perhaps a bit too highbrow for this crowd. He thinks he's better than them!
Plankton	Don't forget, he called you pink!
Plankton	Reunited, and it's gonna feel so good!  D'oh!
Plankton	What do we got here?  Oh, goody. Holographic meatloaf again! When am I gonna get some real food? Mr. Krabs gets to eat real food. Just look at his daughter, she's a big as a whale. I wish I could be successful like Mr. Krabs.  I wish I could somehow just switch lives with him. Just to know what it's like.
Plankton	Er, um, hey there, uh SpongeBob. Uh, SpongeBob?
Plankton	The customer? I'll boil the customer in hot oil, and rip out his  I mean uh, yes, of course, for the lovely... customer.
Plankton	But I've never reviewed anything... except those foreign exercise videos my cousin sent me.
Plankton	All right, the sauce.
Plankton	"What's the matter with you? All I said was ""A little too much sauce."" It's no big deal, really."
Plankton	Glad that's over.
Plankton	Hope you like gray.
Plankton	If it'll get you out of my antennae.  Go crazy.
Plankton	In a cosmic sort of way, yes.
Plankton	I command you to stop that. Stop that and return to your post!  Where's the off button on this thing?
Plankton	Take cover from what?!
Plankton	That's terrible!
Plankton	It's not worth it! It's just not worth it! Goodbye, everyone. I'll remember you all in therapy.  Holographic meatloaf? My favorite!
Plankton	Hey! Hey! Heeeeeeeyyyyy! I'm yelling over here!
Plankton	Anyone can come in and redecorate, pal, but you still haven't proven how you're gonna make chum edible!
Plankton	Who took my blue blanky? Huh? This is the secret stuff? Doesn't look very promising.
Plankton	Secret!!!!
Plankton	Maybe I can't, but the Pat-Bot 3000 can. Behold! A hydraulic metal claw to crush your bones! A titanium tipped ripping saw to cut your flesh! And a paddle ball! Made from rubber and wood! And a staple. Anyways, get him!
Plankton	Now give me the patty! Huh?
Sandy	I do!
Sandy	"You just tell us where they are, Chief, and we'll hog-tie 'em faster than you can say ""Salsa Verde."""
Sandy	Hmm... I don't know why, but I think I'll kick SpongeBob's butt tomorrow.
Sandy	SpongeBob! Look out for that tree!
Sandy	Ooh, that's gotta hurt!
Sandy	Whatcha all doing sitting in the middle of the floor like that?
Sandy	How are you gonna keep your job at the Krusty Krab?
Sandy	Don't worry Pat, we'll get SpongeBob to come outside, and then he'll see there's nothing to be afraid of.
Sandy	Now you got to blow out the candles and make a wish.
Sandy	Underwater surfing!
Sandy	Patrick, that's not fun.
Sandy	Now remember. Don't jump out until I give the signal!
Sandy	But you're supposed to be in the gorilla suit.
Sandy	Ah, that's okay, SpongeBob. Us too.
Sandy	Hey, Patrick, you wanna hear a joke?
Sandy	But scientifically speaking, its caused by your epiglottis constricting your larynx causing irregular air intake and respiratory upset.
Sandy	You're getting warmer.
Sandy	Did somebody say boom?
Sandy	Let me show you how it works.
Sandy	Hold on tight.
Sandy	Hmmm, I wonder what would happen if I tried zapping you back in the transporter.
Sandy	I'll continue working on it. In the meantime, you boys keep your head up.
Sandy	I'm still putting it together. At best I'll have it ready, uhh, the day after tomorrow? Maybe? [Squidward pushes Sandy's air helmet]
Sandy	One blast of this Molecular Separator Ray and you'll be separated for good.
Sandy	My bosses. They're coming for an inspection. I've worked day and night for a week, but none of my inventions are any good. If I don't have a real impressive invention by this afternoon, they'll cut my funding, and I'll have to leave Bikini Bottom.
Sandy	Oh, it's no use, SpongeBob! I just have to face facts. I'm leaving Bikini Bottom because... I'm a failure.
Sandy	What in tarnation?!  What's with all the monkey business?!
Sandy	Don't push it.
Sandy	Well, the only thing left is to figure out what to do with this infernal contraption.
Sandy	But my karate is better than your karate by a country mile and I've never been invited.
Sandy	I don't know -- lucky guess?
Sandy	SpongeBob, your karate's not good enough to handle those sidewinders.
Sandy	SpongeBob, ya'll are getting a bit wily.
Sandy	That dang SpongeBob. Who does he think he is? I taught that yellow egomaniac everything he knows about fighting - - and that ain't much.
Sandy	SpongeBob?
Sandy	No one can resist jelly-filled.  Sticky around, I'll be back with the glazed.
Sandy	That's enough lip out of you.
Sandy	What are you talking about?
Sandy	You're in the soup now, Udon!  Udon
Sandy	I sure wish I had a fancy telescope. One that works underwater. That'd make me happier than a junebug at a porch light sale.
Sandy	There you are, SpongeBob. Are you ready for karate prac...tice?
Sandy	We need to talk.
Sandy	Umm, SpongeBob?
Sandy	It's time to be strong.
Sandy	Hmm.  Just as I thought.  You have that pointy bit from the end of your clarinet stuck in your throat. That was  clumsy of you.
Sandy	That's right, Squidward. Let me show you.  This whole lab is called the Chamber of Shrinkage.  I'll shrink the sub and myself to microscopic size..  ...then navigate through  your brain,  down into your throat,  then extract the reed  from inside. Simple!
Sandy	I'm back, SpongeBob.  Uh-oh.
Sandy	Well, why don't you take a look for yourself?
Sandy	Stop it, you itty-bitty idiot!
Sandy	Stop it! What are you trying to do? Kill him?
Sandy	Oh, just your autograph for when you're, uh... famous.
Sandy	You're not in control of your actions!  Hey!
Sandy	SpongeBob, you gotta get out of there! It's a straight shot up the stomach to the esophagus where the reed is!  You can complete your mission if we can just access an alternative fuel.  Like natural gas.
Sandy	He's right.
Sandy	They're headed for the esophagus.  Phew, what have you been eating?
Sandy	SpongeBob, what on earth are you doing?!
Sandy	Hang on. I'm going to get some sealant and patch and trowel!
Sandy	SpongeBob?
Sandy	Oh, that's just crazy talk. Hyah!
Sandy	Wrap it up.
Sandy	I'm going to the moon, SpongeBob!
Sandy	SpongeBob, this isn't for fun.  See this? This is science. I don't have time for games and I don't have time for stowaways.
Sandy	But this time, just don't touch anything, okay?
Sandy	SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space. Now go home and get some shut eye. Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave those crazy alien notions behind.
Sandy	SpongeBob, what are y'all doing? I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble. Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages. You darned turned my little science experiment into a disaster. You two oughta should be ashamed of...
Sandy	Hey, SpongeBob, Patrick. What y'all doing?
Sandy	I wouldn't trust you two with any of this stuff.
Sandy	Well, that makes as much sense as a snake with no slither. Patties are put in the water for eating, SpongeBob. Not for bebopping all over Timbuktu.
Sandy	Sorry, SpongeBob, he's got a fierce no-singing policy.
Sandy	Looks... Tasty, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Thank you very rawness, SpongeBob and Pat.
Sandy	A flea is a dastardly little vermin that bites us air breathers. But this here flea collar will send the critter a-runnin'.
Sandy	Patrick  there ain't no such thing as vampires.
Sandy	Yah!  Enough! I will not take this anymore!  Whatcha gonna do now, punks?  Looky, it worked. Phew. I'm glad that's over.
Sandy	Aah!
Sandy	Would you two men stop yelling at each other?!  What does that prove?! If were gonna get out of this, we gotta work together.
Sandy	Howdy, y'all. Hey SpongeBob, you having a garage sale?
Sandy	"""Here, Patrick, have a Krabby Patty!""  There he is, Patrick. Say your line!"
Sandy	Well, holly-wally ding-dang-doo. Would ya' look at that!? Take a gander, y'all!
Sandy	Hoppin' acorns. Look at all this high tech gear!  What does this gizmo do?
Sandy	Sounds like them critters is in trouble!  Hold on, fellas! I'll be there soon, as soon as I send these critters to their doom!  Look out, germs. The end is here, Your days are numbered, 'cause Sandy's here! I'll get these germs, and make 'em pay, with some good old fashioned ka-rah-tey. Hi-yah! If I borrow some elements from the periodic table I can mix up a brew that is sure to disable any virus, bug, or sniffle that steps into my path. And make them feel my mi-cro-sco-pic wrath! Hi-yah!
Sandy	I'll show you.  Now I can eat underwater without removing my helmet! This is just the beginning! I should have a cure for the common cold up and running by tomorrow afternoon with your high-tech lab!
Sandy	Come on Patrick!
Sandy	And I'm bummed.
Sandy	Yee-haw! Get along little fishies.
Sandy	Why? Did he write it down?
Sandy	So how'd you get the black eye then?
Sandy	Oh no he ain't!
Sandy	I don't have time for this, I'm late for my survival training camp.
Sandy	No!
Sandy	Yup. And I'm happy to say that you both passed! Here's your survivalist medals!
Sandy	HI-YAH!
Sandy	Come on, I'll bet y'all got someone famous in your family tree.
Sandy	It's a statue of SpongeBuck SquarePants!
Sandy	Yeah, and it's covered in jellyfish poop.
Sandy	Wow!
Sandy	No!!
Sandy	We ain't got time for that. Hi-yah!
Sandy	Gary! What happened to you?
Sandy	Well, apparently, he's left Bikini Bottom, and he ain't coming back.
Sandy	Yup, and it involves this.  It'll track any sponge within a 50-mile radius.
Sandy	SpongeBob!
Sandy	That's not SpongeBob, Patrick. There's SpongeBob.
Sandy	CheeseHead BrownPants?
Sandy	Surprised I found you?
Sandy	[Mayor CheeseHead BrownPants enters a limo] SpongeBob, wait!
Sandy	You OK, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Hey, SpongeBob. Who's your friend?
Sandy	He has such a way with words.
Sandy	SpongeBob! How long have you been standing there buddy?
Sandy	Or, perhaps I walked into the Krusty Krab, purchased them,  and received a receipt for these legally obtained patties!
Sandy	"Oh, give me that!  ""Sandy Cheeks or Sandy Chump? Bushy tailed brainiac really a slow-witted squirrel, by... SpongeBob SquarePants?""  That yellow sidewinder thinks he can do that to"
Sandy	-eeeeeeeeeeeeeee-
Sandy	Cowabunga!
Sandy	Oh, where am I? Where is everybody? I'm stranded. SpongeBob, where are you?!!
Sandy	May Day!
Sandy	My friends. They went surfing and never returned.
Sandy	Well, you're smelly.
Sandy	Well, if you want arms like mine, you just gotta follow my training program.
Sandy	Ding ding!  Feeling the burn?
Sandy	Have you guys seen SpongeBob anywhere?
Sandy	SpongeBob? Wha-where'd you get those muscles?
Sandy	I'm glad to see you found an exercise program that works for you.
Sandy	Hey, with those arms, you'll do great!
Sandy	Ok, Sandy Cheeks.
Sandy	It's ok, SpongeBob, I already signed your name in.
Sandy	That SpongeBob is funnier than ears on an acorn.
Sandy	Where do you think you're going, SquarePants? You just got here.
Sandy	I'm serving it up, SpongeBob! Ready or not!
Sandy	Well if it isn't SpongeBob UnderPants.
Sandy	I whipped up an invention I'm gonna unveil tonight in front of my comrades, and I need you to be my test subject!
Sandy	Hey, SpongeBob! Just putting the finishing touches on my invention. Thanks for assisting me! You're such a big help! No wonder Mr. Krabs relies on you so heavily.
Sandy	Well, that's an unusual getup.
Sandy	SpongeBob!
Sandy	Hold it! Where is my little assistant going this time?
Sandy	Nonsense, SpongeBob! Of course you can, if you'll just step into the Protogenerator 2000!  First, I close the protochamber...  ...And finally...
Sandy	And how!
Sandy	La da da da dee da da da da da dee...
Sandy	A-doop-doo, a-doop-doop-doo...
Sandy	Shoobie doop doo, shoobie doop doo... I'm getting clean... no fleas on me... gettin' clean...
Sandy	Maybe I left it outside...
Sandy	That no-good who nabbed my pelt surely came here. Probably wanted to cash it in on the Bikini Bottom black market. Well, not if I catch that varmint first.
Sandy	With this much attention, that no-good fur thief will see me comin' a mile away. I best find somethin' to cover my hind end.
Sandy	I'm tired of running. Time to take a stand.
Sandy	What am I gonna do? If I'm ever gonna catch this thug, I'm gonna need some help.
Sandy	PLANKTON! I should have known this was your doin'! Now feel !
Sandy	Gotcha! And now for the appropriate punishment for a no-good, yella' belly like yourself.
Sandy	Hi Patrick, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Howdy Squidward, I mean, Flying Dutchman. Great party, huh?
Sandy	SpongeBob!
Sandy	Get out of my suit! Well, golly! Randy says the rodeos come to town. Ive got to head back to Texas and defend my championship title!
Sandy	No!
Sandy	Rodeo
Sandy	Ride that critter, dont be no quitter! Hold on tight with all your might! Yee-haw! Thats a rodeo. Tractor pulls and big old bulls.  Line dancin, horses prancin!  Barrel racin, bareback ridin!  Bronco bustin,  aluminium sidin.  Thats a rodeo.
Sandy	Rodeo!
Sandy	I must! Its my duty!
Sandy	Ow. Gall darn it! You sea slickers made me lose the rodeo. Why are you here, anyways?
Sandy	SpongeBob!
Sandy	Operation acorn smoothie is a success!
Sandy	I said, what you want to go and do a dangful thing like that for?
Sandy	This is gonna sting worse than a jellyfish in a bucket of electric eels!
Sandy	What's his deal?
Sandy	SpongeBob!
Sandy	Hold it! We can't do that. It might damage his brain. The only way to drive the earworm out is with another catchy tune.
Sandy	You did it! Drove the little critter out!
Sandy	Come on. You ain't gonna find him with that drab little thing. I've got something better.
Sandy	SpongeBob? Patrick?
Sandy	Patrick, what's your first name?
Sandy	Oh, no!
Sandy	Hey, SpongeBob! Lend me your corneas for a second! You too, Patrick!
Sandy	Hi-yah!
Sandy	Hello?  Nice try, SpongeBrain!  Yah!  Heh, silly me.
Sandy	I knew you'd come to your senses, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Uh-huh. Sure, SpongeBob.
Sandy	SpongeBob?  Wait, Mr. Krabs, it's not his fault. It's it's mine. He tried to tell me but I wouldn't listen.  Give him another chance, please?
Sandy	Almost some.
Sandy	You like what?
Sandy	Karate.
Sandy	Hmmm?
Sandy	SpongeBob?
Sandy	Or three!
Sandy	Right!
Sandy	And lettuce!
Sandy	Almost done... Could you hand me that wrench, SpongeBob?
Sandy	There! It's finished! Now I can hide my nuts back in Texas without leavin' my lab!
Sandy	Eugh.
Sandy	We're in business!  Say! This is a dandy lab!
Sandy	So where do I hook up my teleporter?
Sandy	Hold on! SpongeBob, we need you.
Sandy	Eugh! We only teleported his eyes!
Sandy	Stand clear!
Sandy	Well, we're getting closer.  Goggles!
Sandy	It worked! We transported his whole body this time!
Sandy	Take that, you sorry old clam! Y'all need to learn some manners!  You're about as ugly as homemade soup.
Sandy	Well SpongeBob, take a gander at this!
Sandy	Heck, no. I need it to breath! I gotta have my air.
Sandy	Hello?
Sandy	That ain't a problem, is it? Hi-yah!
Sandy	You know, you're the first sea critter to ever visit.
Sandy	I like you, SpongeBob. We could be tighter than bark on a tree!
Sandy	There, that ought to do it! If y'all needed water, you shoulda asked.  I propose a toast, to new friends!  Hold on a second.  I hope you like your tea strong. Drink up!
Sandy	Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!
Sandy	SpongeBob!
Sandy	Woo wee! Looks like I lost them!  The remote shorted out! The robots,  Whoa!  Aaaa!
Sandy	Huh?
Sandy	We can't let that double crosser beat us to the loot! Full speed ahead and don't stop for nothin', Gary!
Sandy	I say she's in quick need of a reboot! Heee ya!
Sandy	And exactly how do you propose we find him?
Sandy	Gasp! Oh my gosh! Patrick! Wing to the other side!  Excuse me, ma'am
Sandy	You said it, SpongeBob! I already gnawed through my[???]  I'm getting to the point where I can eat just about ANYTHING!  Mmmm... sponge kabob...  Hey Patrick, you got any more of that Gooey Worms on you?
Sandy	And are you aware I just saved your life?
Sandy	Perhaps over there.
Sandy	Hmm... White knuckles, leaky pores, and stomach in knots. Y-y-yep. He does look pretty bad. SpongeBob, you're afflicted to severe oral report-itis. You know, patients with this disease have been known to physically explode. Ker-pow!
Sandy	Well, of course it isn't, silly! I'm only wearing my undies. See if it works on Patrick.
Sandy	And let's not forget the science fair!
Sandy	By someone, I was implying me, SpongeBob.  Yes, Patrick?
Sandy	"Oh no, SpongeBob. That's what you call a ""coincidence."" I'm getting ready for my vacation!"
Sandy	...load up the moon wagon?
Sandy	Uh, I'm kinda busy here, SpongeBob. Gotta recalculate to account for the extra weight.
Sandy	Because, as we leave Earth's gravity, everything becomes weightless, and any un-contained food will float off in all directions!
Sandy	Now, get ready for lunar module se
Sandy	You ride these on that like this.  Yeehaw! Right here is the Flip-a-dee-do-dah.  Right there is the classic Texas tail grab.  And this I call the 7-20 Nut Drop.  Munchie! And let's not forget my grandpappy's favorite: The Tour to Saturn.  Star gazer! Yeehaw! Nothing like extreme sports and zero gravity! Alright your turn.
Sandy	Wow, SpongeBob! What do you call that trick?  Interesting. Maybe you can teach me how to do a Waaaaah!
Sandy	If the fuel holds out, there's no reason to panic.  Without the engines, we've lost all control. We're coming in too steep!
Sandy	Not if I can keep her nose up we aren't. Hang on! It's gonna get bumpy when we hit the atmosphere.  Yeehaw!
Sandy	Hello?
Sandy	I'm on my way over to take him to the hospital.
Sandy	Patrick, you open this door.  Patrick, sometimes I just don't understand you.  Hey!  Ok, Patrick, where's SpongeBob?
Sandy	Patrick, SpongeBob has to see a real doctor.
Sandy	Don't be silly, Patrick!
Sandy	You should be arrested for impersonating a doctor!
Sandy	Sure, I was looking for milkshake gremlins!
Sandy	Hey, corpse breath! You better let my friends out of there if you know what's good for ya!
Sandy	Frog whiskers! The Dutchman's on our tail!
Sandy	That's right, SpongeBob. I know it's last minute, but...
Sandy	And i'm setting it to maximum power.
Sandy	Quit your worryin', y'all. I can fix it all with my handy dandy rubble reverse ray blaster.
Sandy	That's sweet of you, SpongeBob, but a bunch of little old bubbles ain't gonna clear these air lines.
Sandy	Hey there, Patty-Pat-Pat-Pat-Patrick. Careful where you're breathing. You don't want to disturb the subatomic particle rodeo. Yee-haw, micro-dawgies! Rope them molecules.
Sandy	Ahh...  You taste like glass.
Sandy	Oh, well, I guess I won't be needing this anymore.
Sandy	Hmm... In case you forgot, it was bubbles that got into this mess in the first place. I don't want you blowing any more bubbles around my house.
Sandy	Yes but there's one even higher than that!  The blacker belt!
Sandy	You sure you want to do this buddy?
Sandy	Don't be disappointed, SpongeBob. A belt isn't the most important thing in karate.
Sandy	I know SpongeBob will impress you if you give him one more chance!
Sandy	How about them moves?
Sandy	Hey, SpongeBob! I like my Patty in twelfths please!
Sandy	Huh?
Sandy	And good afternoon to you Mr. Krabs. What brings you out to this fine neck of the woods?
Sandy	That's what they all say. Did I already show you my single wheeled roller skate or my helicopter that is powered by coconut milk?
Sandy	This is the result of an experimental growth serum I develop. It could easily feed a lot of hungry people.
Sandy	Sandy to SpongeBob.  Sandy to SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob.
Sandy	Uhh, SpongeBob, we got ourselves a little problem. I got a pack of chocolate-eating scallops trying to rustle the balloon! Hi-yah! Get away, you sweet-toothed varmints! Hi-yah! I'm going to be a little late!
Sandy	Yee-haw! Get along little shellfish! Gallop you scallops!
Sandy	Then you won't mind if I run a simple test.  You're SpongeBob alright...
Sandy	Oh, snap out of it SpongeBob! Now if only we had some mayonnaise.
Sandy	Yep. We're all rested and jelly-fied.
Sandy	SpongeBob! Look out!
Sandy	Then hurry and throw it, SpongeBob!
Sandy	What do you want?
Sandy	I'll be right over!
Sandy	Well what are we waiting for? Let's get this restoration underway!
Sandy	But, arguing ain't gonna get this pineapple fixed. Good point!  Okay, fellas! From now on, we incorporate everyone's ideas.
Sandy	Oh, I know. But, isn't this better?
Sandy	Well, what do you think, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Good job, fellers!
Sandy	: Well I shouldn't say licensed. Just sit back, relax, and let my gentle mammalian hands melt away that tension.
Sandy	Merry Christmas, SpongeBob!
Sandy	Dagnabbit, SpongeBob, you got fruitcake in my Christmas magic analyser!  Well, I'll be hornswaggled. My analyzer's found something in the fruitcake! This is terrible!
Sandy	You're an idiot.
Sandy	Congratulations, SpongeBob, your song worked!
Sandy	What's the next challenge?
Sandy	Yeehaw!
Sandy	Raw?!
Sandy	I did it! I'm alive! I can't wait to show them experts the pictures of my record breaking feats.
Sandy	Got your camera?
Sandy	I've decided to go about this scientifically. I feel with careful planning an precise delication of appropriate tasks, I can manage the successful completion of the maximum number of records broken in the least amount of time! Book! Picture!
Sandy	Cheese!  Picture!
Sandy	Woohoo! What's next?
Sandy	Just! One! MORE! Oh no!  Next!
Sandy	What?
Sandy	There it is, the world's largest house of cards!
Sandy	Hey! Where do you think you're going? Get back in line. I need every available robot for this one. Most Robots built and destroyed in a day.
Sandy	Well, let's have a look. SpongeBob!
Sandy	Good for you, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Great! Now repeat after me: HIYAH!
Sandy	The only way to protect yourself is if you know the basics. Now give it a chop!
Sandy	Hmm... we're gotta make this more personal for you Squidward. So is to help you bring out your inner dragon! SpongeBob!
Sandy	"Oh really? Well Squidward, a wise sensei once told me:""One must first know the movements of everyday, to master ka-rah-tay!"
Sandy	Atta boy Squiddy! Be sure to twist that torso!
Sandy	Well, I wouldn't go that far. But you have proven yourself worthy of...  ...the Belt of Basic Competence!
Sandy	Looks like he's not worthy of this belt after all. Thanks for dishonoring our trust in you Squidward.
Sandy	What is wrong with you people?! That goo can destroy everything!
Sandy	I have a comment: Super Goo is evil!  Stay in your homes!
Sandy	That there is a Texas-sized bubble!  First, we'll check its tensile strength.  Tight as a drum.
Sandy	How many times do I have to tell you that stuff's dangerous? Now, how are y'all gonna clean that gunk off?
Sandy	Phew, that was a close one.
Sandy	If that thing pops, we can kiss our beautiful town goodbye!
Sandy	Or the mind of someone else. Look!  Plankton! I knew it!
Sandy	Oh, no, you don't!  Come here, you little varmint! You stay right there! Yippee! We got him now!
Sandy	Retreat! Retreat!
Sandy	And he's headin' right for us!
Sandy	Well, if you ain't going touse your helmet, I suggest you make it quick, SpongeBob.
Sandy	I hate to precipitate on your party, SpongeBob, but that is impossible. No air breather could ever do that. Not even me!
Sandy	I'm just wondering, SpongeBob. I mean, he does defy all scientific logic, considering the fact that all air breathing mammals need oxygen to the brain and lungs to survive for more than 3 minutes.
Sandy	Just get out ofhere already.  You can never trust a cat. Or is it a dog?
Sandy	Ohh, it's nothing but a memory now.
Sandy	No, thanks.
Sandy	Oh, I guess I'm just feeling a little homesick.
Sandy	Wish I was back in Texas. The ocean's no place for a squirrel.  Wish I was in Texas, prettiest place in the world oh no. I guess that deep in my heart, I'll always be a Texas girl. I wanna go hooooooooooooooome, home.
Sandy	I'm going back home to Texas.
Sandy	I just can't do that, SpongeBob. It'd be too sad.
Sandy	No, you can't!
Sandy	Y'all best cut it out!
Sandy	SpongeBob, you've been messing with the bull! Now here come the horns!
Sandy	[] I'm not crying, I'm laughing! I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you're surrounded by critters that care about ya.
Sandy	What did you just say?!
Sandy	Whoa, there. You do not want to eat that.
Sandy	First rule of wilderness training, is map out your course, by taking note of local landmarks!
Sandy	This time, he did research.
Sandy	Yee-haw! Beach broad property!
Sandy	Hush, now! This won't hurt a bit.
Sandy	That was a smart move, Squidward!
Sandy	Hey SpongeBob, y'all going to see the Mermaidman movie with us?
Sandy	Huh?
Sandy	Older lumpy looking female subject. Obviously, a mother. Hates daughter.
Sandy	I gotta find new subjects.
Sandy	Hey, fellas! How'd you like to be part of my cool experiment?
Sandy	Yeah. Just do what you naturally do.  Be natural. Starting now!
Sandy	Subjects acting natural. Resume observation.
Sandy	Double eureka!
Sandy	Ok. First thing. Go to the beach and fill one bucket with white sand and one bucket with black sand. Can you do that?
Sandy	Time to get to work.
Sandy	Oh. And Patrick, you're in charge.
Sandy	Free ice cream!
Sandy	All sold out. Maybe I'll get some later.
Sandy	All gone!
Sandy	Oh, I didn't think this all the way through! I've gotta shut this down!
Sandy	The experiment is over!
Sandy	Sorry. We're all out.
Sandy	Okay.
Sandy	I don't know, SpongeBob. I think you should be careful.
Sandy	Don't give up SpongeBob! You have to find something you love! Something to live for!
Sandy	SpongeBob wins!
Sandy	Hey!
Sandy	Patrick, stop! I can save it with science.
Sandy	Aw, I hope this is the pick-me-up you needed ole' girl.  Well, kiss my grits! This here's the biggest acorn I ever did see!  And so are those! I'd better start storing these for winter.  I might need an alternate storage solution.
Sandy	Just dump these somewhere! I'm gonna put more under my bed.
Sandy	Woo-hoo! That's delicious!
Sandy	Sure, Patrick! Here's the last of it!
Sandy	Who are all these people?
Sandy	Making everyone's day with my Nutty Butter really gives me the warm and tinglies!
Sandy	Don't worry about my tree, SpongeBob. Worry about the crowd of Nutty Butter fans outside.
Sandy	Oh no! What in the Sam Hill is goin' on around here?
Sandy	Oh, I got so wrapped up in not letting anyone down that I asked too much of my tree and my friends.
Sandy	Here. Take these. They're clean.
Sandy	What did you lie about, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Proper take off, check. How are ya doing in there?
Sandy	Contact!
Sandy	Don't worry, SpongeBob. You'll be, uh, just fine. Yeah.
Sandy	You should give up that formula. Mr. Krabs would have to be as dumb as Patrick.
Sandy	Uh, that's mud.
Sandy	Hey, don't do that!
Sandy	And you weren't affected because you're a computer. Looks like it's up to us to find a cure for the town's idiocy.
Sandy	Oh, it doesn't seem to be working. You know him. How do you get him to change?
Sandy	That gives me an idea.
Sandy	Good mornin', students.
Sandy	Yep! Day after tomorrow is graduation! And everybody learned so well.
Sandy	Hello?
Sandy	Excuse me, kind sir. Would you mind too terribly if we just came in your house for a minute and looked around for my friend's missin' brains?
Sandy	Hey, fellas! I think I've found your brains!
Sandy	Everyone has their brains back, so I'm a let it go this time. But if you steal as much as a beach ball, so help me I'll...
Sandy	Sure was nice of you two to donate your whirly brains to the old timer. You fellas did a good deed today.
Sandy	Boy, SpongeBob is really getting out of control with his impression obsession.
Sandy	All right, remember guys, this is an intervention, so we need to make sure that above all, SpongeBob knows how much we all care about him.
Sandy	You know, it's okay to be yourself, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Are you all right, SpongeBob? How many fingers am I holding up?
Sandy	Ah! Hold still, you little rascal!
Sandy	Urrgh! Where?! Where?!
Sandy	Being a little shy huh?
Sandy	Dang.
Sandy	Howdy yall!
Sandy	I'm losing track of which way is up in here.
Sandy	We're ok, SpongeBob?
Sandy	This place sure got a friendlying hurry.  Duck!
Sandy	Speaking of which.
Sandy	Sure.  Well come on, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Okay, here it comes!
Sandy	That wasn't funny, SpongeBob! Y'all had me worried sick!
Sandy	Okay boys, this here is Birdy's food. Feed him twice a day.
Sandy	Well, that's his dinner.  Well, I guess that's it. I gotta go.  See you guys in a couple of days.
Sandy	I didn't know I'd be missed so much. Golly, maybe I should go out of town more often.
Sandy	Hello? Hello?!  Guess ya'll don't want my money.
Sandy	Don't touch that!
Sandy	It means it's THE END! The sandwich gods are angry with us!
Sandy	Soon, our post-apoca-whatchamacallit will be over and Krabby Patties will rain down from above!
Sandy	Oh, brother.
Sandy	I ain't been too smart since I found this old piece of paper!
Sandy	eeee.....
Sandy	But they're still all over the ground!
Sandy	No, silly. It's a mammalian thing.
Sandy	You're telling me. And there's still so much stuff to do! We gotta climb some things!
Sandy	I don't wanna go to sleep yet!
Sandy	Well I'm glad, SpongeBob, 'cause for the next seven days, it's gonna be you, me, and these sweatbands!  Yee-ha!
Sandy	Nothing like a refreshing morning dip, huh, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Go!  Come on, SpongeBob. We're goin' for a tandem ride through the park!
Sandy	Hold that thought, SpongeBob! 'Cause it's time for a down-home favorite!  Find the hay in the needle stack!  Did you find it?
Sandy	SpongeBob?!  SpongeBob?  Where are you, little square dude?  SpongeBob's tie! And all his other little dressins! But... but... he always folds his clothes before running around in the nude! Something terrible must have happened to him!  Alright, listen up, y'all! I'm rounding up a search party! SpongeBob's gone missing!
Sandy	Check in this here moist cave!
Sandy	Well, look again!
Sandy	I heard that!! No one's going anywhere until we find SpongeBob!
Sandy	That's just a cereal box. Besides, he's yellow.
Sandy	Oh, SpongeBob, I was so worried! I thought something terrible happened!  Come on. There's just enough time to go atom smashing.
Sandy	What?! Y'all never heard of Christmas?
Sandy	I've had enough of your dastardly deeds, Dirty Dan. I'm gonna get you and your partner, Pinhead Larry or my name ain't Sheriff... Sandy...
Sandy	I warned ya, Dirty Dan! Now, you've just crossed the border into Hurtville!
Sandy	Which one of you fellers is the real Dirty Dan?!
Sandy	Wow, spring already?
Sandy	Hey, guys!
Sandy	Spring  is lovely.
Sandy	Uhh, y-yeah...
Sandy	Well, I can't argue with that.
Sandy	Hmph!  Hello, little critter! What's your name?
Sandy	Umm, I need to talk to you about them squirrel jokes.
Sandy	I'm just asking you as a friend, please lay off them squirrel jokes, OK? Tell some of them other jokes you got.
Sandy	I understand everything that's going on, SpongeBob.
Sandy	I'm just being my own au-naturally squirrelly self!  Well come on in! Y'all must be tired from telling them funny jokes all the time. Why don't you take a load off!
Sandy	Oh, that's right. Youse a sea critter. Now what was that thing that sea critters need? Umm, uhh... let's see, uhh...  Sea critters need, uhh...
Sandy	Well, why didn't you just say so!  Yup, a squirrel sure is stupid.
Sandy	You know, SpongeBob, sometimes it's nice to hang up my hang-glider and just watch the clouds roll by.
Sandy	They all look like flowers, SpongeBob. All the time.
Sandy	Course I can! I'm a squirrel. See?
Sandy	Sorry, SpongeBob, that's the way the coral crumbles!
Sandy	[] Well. It's about time you showed up.
Sandy	Hey!
Sandy	Well, I was just funning with you that time! But I guess all y'all underwater don't have to play fair!
Sandy	Chum chewer!
Sandy	Only 'cause it's true! We're best at horse riding and fur stylin' and rowing. Y'all got us licked in swimming, but we've got corn shucking  and hay bailing and barn raising... and fishing!
Sandy	[] Give me that. They don't call me Cheeks for nothing.
Sandy	No!
Sandy	Mm-mm.
Sandy	Nope, nothing but the clothes on your backs.
Sandy	Look. Unless you can stay above water for one measly minute, you forfeit the contest and prove that land creatures are better than sea creatures!
Sandy	Sorry I made you go up on dry land, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Now, what was it you wanted to talk about, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Looking to add fulfillment to your dull, dull life?
Sandy	Aw shucks. I don't want your money. I was just playing up the drama of the moment, is all.  Nope. I'm gonna take that spineless critter down for nothing, 'cause this is personal. Look. My tail's gone!  Varmint must've got it while I had my back turned, the coward!  I am gonna get back what's mine!
Sandy	Hey, SpongeBob, you coming to watch?
Sandy	"SpongeBob, I'm from Texas. What you think is big and what I think is big are two totally different ""big""s. Besides, he's got my tail. I can't take that sitting down."
Sandy	Well, why didn't you just say so? Give it here! Come on!  SpongeBob, that's a paper clip and a piece of string.
Sandy	Well, I gotta admit, that slowed me down, but I'm still going for him!
Sandy	SpongeBob, quit your worrying. I can take care of myself. After all, who's the strongest critter in Bikini Bottom?
Sandy	Right. And I can handle your little bull worm too, 'cause I am the best there is! There ain't nothin' too big or too ornery for me to catch.
Sandy	No!
Sandy	Course I am! I'm going in, and I ain't coming out 'til I got me a big heaping plate of worm stew.  Aha! There you are, you tail-nabbin' varmint! Hi-yah!  I'm winnin', SpongeBob!
Sandy	Yee-haw!  I got him, SpongeBob!
Sandy	Ohhhh. This is the tongue, and... the whole thing... is the... worm.  Run for your life!
Sandy	Not now, SpongeBob!
Sandy	No!
Sandy	Yeah?
Sandy	We saved the town!
Sandy	Well, you can't leave us small forever!
Sandy	SpongeBob's actin' jumpier than a rattlesnake in a pickle barrel. Wait... what?
Sandy	Hi-yah!
Sandy	Hi-yah!
Sandy	How tough am I?
Sandy	You ran inside and slipped on an ice cube.
Sandy	"Here's a comprehensive list of ""do""s and ""don't""s to follow."
Sandy	...is check this thermometer right here and make sure the temperature is normal.
Sandy	Oh! Why, thank you, SpongeBob!
Sandy	Are you sure?
SpongeBob	Look at me, I'm...  ...naked!  Gotta be in top physical condition for today, Gary.
SpongeBob	I was just...
SpongeBob	I did.
SpongeBob	I'm ready!
SpongeBob	Permission to come aboard, captain!  I've been training my whole life for the day I could join the Krusty Krew,  And now I'm ready.  So, uh, when do I start?
SpongeBob	Barg'N-Mart, meeting all of your spatula needs.
SpongeBob	I got it, I got it! Coming.
SpongeBob	Well, yeah, but...
SpongeBob	Right, back... it up.
SpongeBob	Backing up! Backing up!
SpongeBob	Well, we can still deliver it on foot.
SpongeBob	Shh, shh, shh. It's working.
SpongeBob	I can't, its for the customer!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	I think town's this way.
SpongeBob	Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think...
SpongeBob	Wait, I remember now. It was coral!
SpongeBob	Well?
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	Look, we're saved!
SpongeBob	It's not just a boulder.  It's a rock.  A rock! A rock! Its a big beautiful, old rock.  Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape.
SpongeBob	What drink?
SpongeBob	Did he change his mind?
SpongeBob	Can I make a Krabby Patty now?
SpongeBob	Ah, POOP!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, can I have a raise?
SpongeBob	Whoever sent this obviously has no idea about the physical limitations of life underwater! Well, might as well throw these in the fire.
SpongeBob	"Sign here please.  Initial here, and here, and here, and here.  Oh look, it's a picture I took of you the first time I ever came here!  Look at you, so young and happy!  Where do the years go? Hey, what's that? ""Plan Your Own Party Kit""? Hey Lou, how much?"
SpongeBob	"Boy, Gary, this ""Plan Your Own Party Kit"" is a real life-saver.  How else would I have known to make freshly-whipped clotted cream.  Gary, you better call an astronomer, because this clotted cream is outta this world!  My piata!  The ""Plan Your Own Party Kit"" suggests creativity when stuffing your piata, so I'm using deviled eggs."
SpongeBob	Okay, Gary, get ready. It's almost 8:00! Here they come!  Don't worry too much Gary, it's only 10 seconds past 8:00.  Now it's 20 seconds past 8:00! Maybe no one got their invitations! 30 seconds past 8:00! Oh, I'm doomed!  No one's coming! I'm the worst host ever!  Oh, the first guest! And only 40 seconds late.
SpongeBob	So, the punch okay?
SpongeBob	Please let Gary take your coat, then allow me to offer you some hors d'oeuvres and a glass of punch.
SpongeBob	Squidward, you made it!
SpongeBob	Well, it's about time. Okay, everyone, the last guest is about to arrive...  22 minutes late!
SpongeBob	Could I have everyone's attention please?  Patrick!  If everyone could take a seat on the couch please, while I sort this out. Thank you, thanks.  Hey everybody, thanks for your patience. I know we've gotten off to a rocky start here, so I'm going to get us back on track. It is now 8:37, and we all know what that means!  Time to read aloud from the newspaper comics! Okay, I think I'll start out with 'The Wisenheimers.' Okay, panel one: we see Roxy Wisenheimer with some sort of rake. Wait, I can't read from this!  This is yesterday's paper.  I'll just go grab today's paper.  SpongeBob, you sure know how to throw a party. What would they do without you?  Locked out?
SpongeBob	Yes... no, Patrick! I'm SpongeBob! I'm outside!
SpongeBob	Oh no, sounds like someone's rummaging through my medicine cabinet!  I hope they don't touch my special comb.
SpongeBob	I'm no criminal! I live here! I'm...I'm throwing a party. I got locked out, I swear!
SpongeBob	Is it too late to offer you some punch?
SpongeBob	I am?
SpongeBob	HI, MAILMAN!
SpongeBob	That's funny, I don't remember subscribing to Fancy Living Digest.
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward, how do the people in that magazine get all that money?
SpongeBob	Quick Patrick, without thinking, if you could have anything in the world right now, what would it be?
SpongeBob	Fancy living, here we come!
SpongeBob	Yes sir, we ARE chocolate bar salesmen!
SpongeBob	Huh? Say, weren't you the same guy who sold us these candy bar bags?
SpongeBob	I... got it! One chocolate bar for the nice-
SpongeBob	That's it! He made us feel special!
SpongeBob	Remember Patrick, flatter the customer. Make him feel good.
SpongeBob	Wanna buy some chocolate?
SpongeBob	Let's shake on it.
SpongeBob	I can't understand what were doing wrong.
SpongeBob	Yet they sell millions of bags a day!
SpongeBob	Hello, young lady.
SpongeBob	If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!
SpongeBob	They'll make you fly!
SpongeBob	Yeah, this guy will feel sorry for us, he'll have to buy all of our chocolate!
SpongeBob	Come on, Patrick, let's help him!
SpongeBob	Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to.
SpongeBob	No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please...
SpongeBob	So, how long have you two ladies known each other?
SpongeBob	Evil??
SpongeBob	You can't give up. What if we help you?
SpongeBob	Wow! The Mermalair!
SpongeBob	Holy halibut! it's the chief!
SpongeBob	Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off!  Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today!
SpongeBob	You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it!
SpongeBob	No, they're just the stairs.  These are the Stairs Of Learning.
SpongeBob	And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom.
SpongeBob	Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars too!  There you are.
SpongeBob	The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat.  This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes, Roger would die.
SpongeBob	This is gonna be great!
SpongeBob	Hey Patrick.
SpongeBob	Yes, Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob	I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!
SpongeBob	Thanks a lot, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Whatever you do, don't look at him.
SpongeBob	There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!
SpongeBob	They're talking about us! We're fighting!
SpongeBob	I'd hate you no matter what.
SpongeBob	Mmmm... I'm sorry I called you a Stupid Star!
SpongeBob	Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth!  The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die!
SpongeBob	What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward, you want me to cast out over here so you can watch me?
SpongeBob	I've never seen Mr. Krabs so broken up.
SpongeBob	Oh, I get you.
SpongeBob	What do you mean?
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	Wow, how did you get it back?
SpongeBob	Good morning, pineapple!  Good morning, Gary!
SpongeBob	Fancy. So that's what came in the mail. Looks like Gary has a new little playmate.
SpongeBob	Boy, you got that right. Gary's no...  hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race?
SpongeBob	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail!  Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies!  I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use.
SpongeBob	Patrick, your snail is a rock.
SpongeBob	Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, that's the official.
SpongeBob	What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it!
SpongeBob	Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?!
SpongeBob	Umm, Gary, you can stop now!
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!
SpongeBob	Gary?  Oh!
SpongeBob	Are you ready to go crazy?
SpongeBob	Whoo! I've been looking forward to this night all week!
SpongeBob	You passed the test, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Calm your waters, Mr. Krabs. I modified this little baby myself.
SpongeBob	Goodbye, pals!
SpongeBob	Hello, gang! SpongeBob's back!
SpongeBob	So, are you feeling that wild and crazy feeling, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Patrick, that's not a ride.
SpongeBob	Lame?!
SpongeBob	Why didn't you ask?
SpongeBob	Closing time.  The saddest time of the day!  Huh?  It's a Krabby Patty.  Eww... It's cold and hard.  This could have rolled under there years ago.  There, there, little one, your journey is almost over.
SpongeBob	Order up, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Yes, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'.
SpongeBob	Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Shellphone! I know, I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do!
SpongeBob	Ohh... nematodes.  The only thing left of my house is this little pebble.
SpongeBob	We can't build a house!
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	That'd be great!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick! Wake up! It's me, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	While you're at it, could you get me a glass of water?
SpongeBob	Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Hi, Mom.
SpongeBob	My house is back!  Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be!  Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever!
SpongeBob	Everybody's an idiot except for me.
SpongeBob	My what has a what now?
SpongeBob	My butt is not safe out here!  No part of me is safe!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick's right, Sandy. You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead.
SpongeBob	No problem!  A  long spatula.
SpongeBob	Never ever ever!
SpongeBob	Alright, Patrick, that is enough! Chip, will you mind showing these two to the door?
SpongeBob	Okay, guys, really. This is your saddest attempt yet. Even Chip knows that's Patrick in the same costume that he wore for Halloween last year.
SpongeBob	Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had.
SpongeBob	Gee Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever!  What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?
SpongeBob	Tell me more about summer break.
SpongeBob	Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there.
SpongeBob	You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey!  Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment.  Huh?
SpongeBob	Stall 'em? How do I do that?
SpongeBob	Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles?
SpongeBob	Okay, uh... and now for a finale!  Oops.
SpongeBob	Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
SpongeBob	What are we gonna do?
SpongeBob	Who do you want?
SpongeBob	How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate!
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm scared!
SpongeBob	Okay. Have fun inside.
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Squidward's gonna come camping with us!
SpongeBob	He's tenderizing the ground!
SpongeBob	SpongeBob to Patrick. I read you. Over.
SpongeBob	But this is the wilderness! It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit.
SpongeBob	C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song! Patrick!
SpongeBob	But I had to! It's too dangerous to play the clarinet badly out here in the wilderness! It might attract... a sea bear.
SpongeBob	Patrick's right, Squidward. Sea bears are no laughing matter. Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin...
SpongeBob	Don't stomp around. They take that as a challenge.
SpongeBob	Never wear a sombrero...
SpongeBob	Ever...
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Patrick. I'll draw us an anti-sea-bear circle in the dirt.
SpongeBob	Squidward, are you okay?
SpongeBob	They hate limping more than running!
SpongeBob	Here, draw a circle.
SpongeBob	Heh. Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments, heh heh. Right, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  Awk! Gary, help! I can't see. Gary!  Gary, are you there?  Ow!  Gary? Gary, buddy? I need you to be my eyes, okay? Am I near the bathroom?  Gary? Gary?  Gar?
SpongeBob	Hi Patrick! La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
SpongeBob	While it is against my philosophy to disagree with the customer, I must point out that I am in fact wearing a name tag, right here.  Huh?
SpongeBob	I'm innocent, I tell ya!  Squidward, what happened?
SpongeBob	Cover me till I get back, okay?
SpongeBob	Well, I need you to do it again.
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?
SpongeBob	Oh. All right, let's take it from the top.
SpongeBob	Forget the motivation. Just say hi.
SpongeBob	Patrick, you're a genius. Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now.
SpongeBob	Come on in, buddy. The garbage is fine.
SpongeBob	Patrick? Patrick?
SpongeBob	I'll give you a hint. Two words. First word: my. Second word: name tag.
SpongeBob	Where?! Where?!
SpongeBob	Patrick, are you with me or against me?
SpongeBob	I think you'll find everything shipshape.
SpongeBob	Fry cook SpongeBob reporting, sir!
SpongeBob	Hey guys. Did I miss anything?
SpongeBob	That, Patrick, is a flying machine.
SpongeBob	Don't remind me.
SpongeBob	This is it, Patrick. The physics are all here. This time, I'm gonna fly!
SpongeBob	Go!  It's working! I'm flying!
SpongeBob	You'll see.
SpongeBob	Ooh!  Well, it can't get any worse. D'oh!  I guess I spoke too soon.
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	Yes.
SpongeBob	Who?
SpongeBob	Yeah, Strangler.
SpongeBob	Those officers are right. I need a bodyguard!  Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard.
SpongeBob	You don't understand, mister. I need protection from the scariest guy in town. Here's his picture.
SpongeBob	Or that pebble.  Or that stick.  Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium!
SpongeBob	Ah, but first I gotta do a few errands.
SpongeBob	Hmmm.
SpongeBob	Protect me?
SpongeBob	That gets funnier every time you say it, Patrick. Come on, let's go inside.
SpongeBob	You see, Patrick, Frank here is the master. I learned all I know about pranks from him. Ok, Frank, let's see what you've got.
SpongeBob	Nah.
SpongeBob	Wow, invisible spray!
SpongeBob	I know! We'll go spray the park bench and then sit on it, and when people walk by, we'll be floating in midair.
SpongeBob	That it does, Patrick, that it does. Good thinking. Here, hold this a second.  Ok, Patrick, give me the can.
SpongeBob	Oh my gosh, Patrick, help me find our clothes!
SpongeBob	Oh, no, it can't be! How are we going to pull off the ultimate prank? Thanks a lot, Patrick. You used the last of it.
SpongeBob	Let's ask this guy. Excuse me sir, but do you have the time?
SpongeBob	OK, we're invisible, right?
SpongeBob	Boy, we really scared her!
SpongeBob	There's only one guy left to scare, and we'll have pranked everybody in Bikini Bottom--  Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	You can't escape, Krabs. We've glued the door shut.
SpongeBob	Pay!
SpongeBob	Yeah, the invisible paint stains clothes.
SpongeBob	That Mr. Krabs, always looking out for me. What a guy.
SpongeBob	New business hours: 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
SpongeBob	Krabby Patty, I don't care if we have to stay open until the day after the end of time. As long as I am with you, I am complete.
SpongeBob	Did you hear that spatula? You, me and 10,000 Krabby Patties. And the best part? No breaks!  Wow!
SpongeBob	6,654...
SpongeBob	Oh, hey Mr. Krabs. When did you get here?
SpongeBob	No, don't eat me; I'm too chewy.  Holy shrimp! They're everywhere!
SpongeBob	Spatular.
SpongeBob	Wrestler?
SpongeBob	Oh, good.
SpongeBob	Hatred!
SpongeBob	Work.
SpongeBob	Oh, okay, I've got it.
SpongeBob	Um, you're making me nervous.
SpongeBob	Hypnosis?!
SpongeBob	The king of flavored dairy drinks!  Oh, Krabby Patty, I'm so glad we're friends again.
SpongeBob	Oh, you're right! I'd better get back to work!  Thanks for everything, doc!
SpongeBob	Easy...  Perfection!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Why'd you dig up your navy chest, sir?
SpongeBob	How'd you win that?
SpongeBob	You were?
SpongeBob	wow, my entire arm disintegrated.
SpongeBob	You're alive! And naked...
SpongeBob	Barnacles!
SpongeBob	Wow, it sure is dark in here.  Look Mr. Krabs, I'm you!
SpongeBob	Oh, that'll be a snap. Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years.
SpongeBob	Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story.  Goodnight, wallety.
SpongeBob	I won't let you down.
SpongeBob	Like pineapple? I live in one.
SpongeBob	Thanks for the trophy everybody.
SpongeBob	So there I was, in Jellyfish Fields.
SpongeBob	Oh, well I gotta go. Uhh, thanks.
SpongeBob	None taken, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy spot their arch enemy, Reflecto, up to no good.
SpongeBob	Creatures of the deep, assemble!  Think... harder... Barnacle Boy.  Here they come.
SpongeBob	Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave.
SpongeBob	Hmm, they must be working undercover.
SpongeBob	Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
SpongeBob	Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
SpongeBob	Hold on. Just let me look at ya.
SpongeBob	No, but I'm married.
SpongeBob	Why, are you here to rescue little ol' me?
SpongeBob	This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile.
SpongeBob	This isn't happening. This isn't happening!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, you're here!  Gosh, Mr. Krabs, we were worried something might have happened to you. That the world would've been deprived of the greatest food known to man.
SpongeBob	Oh good, I thought you were hurt.
SpongeBob	We should get Mr. Krabs a new mattress and surprise him with it as a gift. Then we'll never have to be late to work again.
SpongeBob	How many do you think there are?
SpongeBob	Oh, that's okay, as long as Mr. Krabs is happy with his new mattress .
SpongeBob	Is it serious, doctor? Will Mr. Krabs be alright?
SpongeBob	There it is Squidward, underneath that really big guard worm.
SpongeBob	Ah, isn't it beautiful, Patrick? You can see everything from up here.
SpongeBob	Worm-bait to the retriever. Worm bait to the retriever. We're in. Out.
SpongeBob	Affirmative.
SpongeBob	Yes, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Okay, see the stick boy?  Go get it, boy!
SpongeBob	Steak sauce?
SpongeBob	Hey, Mr. Krabs.  No, Mr. Krabs, it's us!
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I will do whatever it takes to keep the Krusty Krab formula from getting into Plankton's evil hands.
SpongeBob	I thought you might want to hear my testimony for when you call me as a character witness. I've been rehearsing it.
SpongeBob	But what about Mr. Krabs' case?
SpongeBob	A suit? Wonder where I could get a suit.
SpongeBob	Your lawyer, umm, fell down on the job, but don't worry Mr. Krabs, I have everything under control. It's uhh, all in here  .
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on the case.
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Mr., uhh, Squidward, is it? My client has been called cheap. Would you agree with the ludicrous statement?
SpongeBob	Answer the question!  Need I remind you that you, sir are under oath?
SpongeBob	Why did you go into the Krusty Krab that day?
SpongeBob	"Close your eyes and hold out your hand.  It's a ""wet floor"" sign. I made it myself."
SpongeBob	He's fine. Uh, Pat, can we talk about this some other time? This snail food is really heavy.
SpongeBob	What was that?
SpongeBob	So, let's get this straight, Gary. You don't want me to defeat the Dirty Bubble. You know, Dirty Bubbleterror of the seven seas, arch nemesis of my favorite TV superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and apparently renowned paddleball champion.  Well, I for one, recognize the importance of this undertaking. But whether or not you do remains to be seen. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to it.  Pets - sometimes I wonder if they understand a word you're saying.  Gary, I hate it when you do that. Now get!  And leave your master to his important affairs.  Hey, I got one! Dirty Bubble, say your prayers.
SpongeBob	Darn it. Darn it.
SpongeBob	I took the Dirty Bubble challenge.
SpongeBob	What happened?
SpongeBob	How long was I taking the Dirty Bubble challenge?
SpongeBob	[his eyes fill up with tears as his lip quivers] I can't find Gary.
SpongeBob	Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here?  Gary! Keep shaking, Patrick.
SpongeBob	[teary-eyed] But there's nowhere left to look.
SpongeBob	"Let's see. ""Dear SpongeBob: These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. Don't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary. At least until my new owner renames me."" Dear Neptune, what have I done?"
SpongeBob	Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was out all night looking for Gary. You see, he ran away and, well, now I...
SpongeBob	Gary...
SpongeBob	Yes, Mr. Krabs. I should've told Gary how important he was to me.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick. We're going to use this stuff to go find Gary.
SpongeBob	Patrick, this is no time for that.
SpongeBob	Gary, please come back to me! Go, boy, go!
SpongeBob	Now I'm hearing things. If only I could see you one more time so I could tell you how much I love you. If only I could hear you meow one last time.
SpongeBob	Ooh. Skill Crane.
SpongeBob	It's a bear! I'm gonna call you .
SpongeBob	There ya go, Beary.
SpongeBob	But, Mr. Krabs, today is Monday.
SpongeBob	Two in one quarter? That's not fair.  What's that ? Oh, you'd rather sit next to ?  There you are, nice and cozy. See ya later, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Mm-hmm.
SpongeBob	Yes?
SpongeBob	Okay, Squidward, okay. I face the crane. Deposit my . Then I close my eyes.
SpongeBob	Squidward, do you wanna win or not?
SpongeBob	Close your eyes.  Now be the crane.  Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the crane.
SpongeBob	I sure did.
SpongeBob	Uhh, Squidward, I don't think the same principles apply.
SpongeBob	Yeah, that's Squidward. He's got the magic touch.  Ding.  Tada!  Ah! Squidward, open your eyes!
SpongeBob	I came to make sure you don't oversleep and miss work.
SpongeBob	Sunday? No wonder Squidward's grumpy. He forgets his Sundays papers. This'll show Squidward I'm a good neighbor. I'll bring it to him.  Man this is heavy.  Oh, pardon me.
SpongeBob	You're the president of 'The Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge'.
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	Okay! I'm ready!  Hey, that worked perfectly! C'mon, good neighbor Patrick, let's paint the town polka dot!
SpongeBob	Nope. I guess he's still on his Sunday drive.
SpongeBob	Patrick star, we'd better check this guy out. Make sure he's safe for Squidward.
SpongeBob	Squidward, does that include
SpongeBob	C'mon, let's go.
SpongeBob	It's like a carnival ride.
SpongeBob	Hmmm, where to look.  Hmmm, this off button seems suspicious.  We did it, Patrick!  President Squidward?
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward, you got one of those, too?  This'll be great! The three of us cleaning up Bikini Bottom. Well, see ya next Sunday, president Squidward!
SpongeBob	Retiring?
SpongeBob	New manager?
SpongeBob	I knew you'd come back, Mr. Krabs, I just knew you would.
SpongeBob	Where's the love?
SpongeBob	Time for work, Squidward. Another day, another dollar.
SpongeBob	Nickel.
SpongeBob	Another day, another nickel.
SpongeBob	I am?
SpongeBob	I have been laughing a lot, lately.
SpongeBob	Sure, I'd love a good laugh.
SpongeBob	Thank you so much, Squidward! I don't know what I'd do without you!  A day without laughter is a small price to pay to save my laugh box from utter destruction. I must remain vigilant.  Nothing funny over there.  Nothing funny over here.
SpongeBob	Wait a minute, Patrick!  Please stop!
SpongeBob	I gotta get outta here.  There's nothing funny up here. But just to be safe...  Ah, I made it 24 hours without laughing.  That's odd.  I've lost my laugh.  I've lost my laugh!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Nothing.
SpongeBob	Sounds painful.
SpongeBob	Hi Squidward.
SpongeBob	I could laugh the whole time?
SpongeBob	See ya later, Squidward.
SpongeBob	"Excuse me, my good man, I believe thou meant to say ""Righteth this wayeth""."
SpongeBob	Pat, do you know how to ride a seahorse?
SpongeBob	Look, some employees from the restaurant came to help us.
SpongeBob	Gee, Pat, these props sure are convincing.
SpongeBob	Wow, what'd you do?
SpongeBob	Wait, we don't leave without Squidly.
SpongeBob	Hey, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	No, we're time travelers.  Help me out here, Patrick.
SpongeBob	We're going on a perilous journey?
SpongeBob	I know we're a prophecy and all, but I don't think we can stop the dragon with our bare hands.
SpongeBob	A little heavy, isn't it?
SpongeBob	I am SpongeBob and this is Patrick.  We've been sent to rescue Princess Pearl from Planktonamor.
SpongeBob	Pssh, did you hear that Patrick? I told you she thinks like a squirrel.  Good one, Medieval Sandy. But can you handle my feet of fury?
SpongeBob	Yeah, you think we fooled them?  Wait, that's Pearl. I must fulfill the prophecy while you untie Patrick and the royal doofus.
SpongeBob	We're here to rescue you, Pearl. Whew! Can I get a glass of water?
SpongeBob	Wait a minute.  Wow, the boys back home will never believe this.
SpongeBob	Patrick look! He's eating the Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	Umm, I'd be more than happy to make you some more of those delicious Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	Right this way, sir.
SpongeBob	SpongeBob!
SpongeBob	You're not Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. You're fakes!
SpongeBob	I think I speak for everyone here when I say we won't stand for these two phony-baloney ruining the good name of our heroes. No right-minded Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy society member would ever pay to see this...this celluloid hoax. I say we boycott this movie! Now who's with me?  Traitors! Wait till we tell Mermaid Man about this.
SpongeBob	But they are! And they're using...  actors.
SpongeBob	Patrick, once again, you have exposed your brilliance. We'll make a real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie. Right here at Shady Shoals.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, to start making a movie.
SpongeBob	City...
SpongeBob	End.  That's great, Pat.  Hmm, seems kinda short.
SpongeBob	We're making a movie.
SpongeBob	Let's meet the highly skilled professionals who will help us fulfill your dream of being on the big screen. Sandy will handle the stunts and explosives.
SpongeBob	This is Squidward. He's in charge of the makeup department.
SpongeBob	Ok, places everybody. Squidward, are our heroes ready?
SpongeBob	What are you doing?
SpongeBob	"Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's ""stolen Krabby Patties."""
SpongeBob	Okay, action!
SpongeBob	Everything's ruined! Well, at least we got the footage.
SpongeBob	Did you just put that on?!
SpongeBob	Mr Krabs, why are you weeping?
SpongeBob	Watch me!
SpongeBob	I got it already, Squidward.  Bubble Bass.
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	Wait! Wait! Wait!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup...  The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing!  Oh.  Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better go on home and rest my brain.  Uhh, which way do I live?  Of course.  No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomatoes, pickles, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No. Shoe?  I am so confused! Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get my head on straight.
SpongeBob	Wait, this isn't right either.  Nope.  Nuh-uh.  Negative.  C'mon, c'mon! Get it right.  Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet!  Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!
SpongeBob	I anything can't do right since because pickles.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I don't know if I...
SpongeBob	Don't you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate! I can't make a Double Krabby Patty with the works!  I can't put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order!
SpongeBob	Rawr.
SpongeBob	And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone: Squidward!  Hip hip...
SpongeBob	Hip hip...
SpongeBob	Whew, you had me worried there, buddy.  Here's your head.
SpongeBob	Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets. C'mon, Patrick.  Look buddy, I captured one!
SpongeBob	Fragile.
SpongeBob	How about some jokes?  Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?
SpongeBob	Ooh, that sounds fancy.
SpongeBob	Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob	Hi, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Together forever.
SpongeBob	Aye aye, cap'n.
SpongeBob	Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on it.
SpongeBob	Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar.
SpongeBob	Wow, they really liked it.
SpongeBob	So, here's where the bizarre twist comes in.
SpongeBob	Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Your Krabby Patty, sir.  Hey, Squidward, cool rock.
SpongeBob	How may I serve you, sir?
SpongeBob	Aye aye, guest sir.
SpongeBob	Psst, that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hairs.
SpongeBob	There's room for you to sit up front!
SpongeBob	Seat-belt-aroony. One second.
SpongeBob	Did I pass this time, Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	I am?
SpongeBob	Crawl?
SpongeBob	How to drive, sir?
SpongeBob	Um, yeah. You just put the jigamahoo on the doohicky and uhh...  I might need a couple minutes.  It's ready, sarge!
SpongeBob	1003, 1004, 1005.  Ooh, pebble #143.  Ha! You will not trip me up pebble #143. 1006, 1007, 1008.  Old lady with a ham sandwich. 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1... 13.
SpongeBob	Yes, sir! Step 1: seatbelts.
SpongeBob	But I can't do it without a blindfold.
SpongeBob	Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now.  I can't see! I can't see!
SpongeBob	I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs. Puff.  I found all the pieces and glued them back together. I promise it won't take me a million tries this time.
SpongeBob	Uh, Patrick, that's not the backscratcher. That's my arm.
SpongeBob	To Sandy's house.  Hey, Sandy, you gotta see this!  Sandy? What's going on here?! Sandy, are you okay?  What's wrong, Sandy?
SpongeBob	SpongeBob to Peanut. Come in, Peanut.
SpongeBob	We can't let Sandy leave, Patrick!
SpongeBob	It's time to get serious, Patrick.
SpongeBob	That's a mirror, Patrick. It's already been invented.
SpongeBob	Sandy's bosses.  The reason we spent all afternoon inventing!
SpongeBob	Professor?
SpongeBob	Don't you think it's time to show them Sandy's invention, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick?
SpongeBob	Uh-huh. Isn't it great?!
SpongeBob	Good work, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.
SpongeBob	Sandy!
SpongeBob	The Flying Dutchman!  What are you doing in my house?
SpongeBob	PATRICK! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!  Patrick, you gotta help me! The Flying Dutch...  ...man.  Gary!  Don't you dare hurt my little Gary!
SpongeBob	Goodnight, Gary.
SpongeBob	Eeeh.
SpongeBob	Just what kinda talk is that? You're just off your game, that's all.
SpongeBob	What is going on around here?
SpongeBob	Look in the mirror. You're a ghost of your former self!
SpongeBob	Now get off of that couch and into your clothes, Dutchman! It's time to get serious.  Let's start you off easy. You think you can take that old lady down there?
SpongeBob	Wait a minute! I think you gave me the answer to all your problems!  ...goblins...guilt trip...
SpongeBob	Good Ol' Dutchie!
SpongeBob	I can buy stuff with just this piece of plastic? I don't need money?
SpongeBob	Angela likes Brad.
SpongeBob	That's it? Hmmm, I'll never understand the workings of high finance.
SpongeBob	Isn't he dreamy?
SpongeBob	That's it. Back it up. Right there. Let 'er go!
SpongeBob	You're a good dad, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Still? From New Year's Eve?  What?! I've been looking everywhere for this, Gary.  My favorite novelty t-shirt!  Oh, someone's here.
SpongeBob	"A videotape?  ""You're a winner -- SpongeBob SquarePants"". I'm SpongeBob SquarePants!"
SpongeBob	Hello, Sandy. Have you heard the news? I've been invited to Karate Island to be crowned the king of karate.
SpongeBob	All right, Sandy, you can come with me to witness my crowning moment.  Are we there yet?
SpongeBob	Oh, thank you.
SpongeBob	Pa-shaw! Watch and learn, sister.  Yup. That's how the King of Karate does it. Who's next?
SpongeBob	My throne.
SpongeBob	But who's being crowned King of Karate - not you.
SpongeBob	Sandy, I need you! I can't handle this myself.
SpongeBob	Don't do it, Sandy!
SpongeBob	Did you say a monster Krabby Patty?!
SpongeBob	Work? How can I go back to work without... without Spat?!
SpongeBob	Thank you, Doctor.
SpongeBob	OW!
SpongeBob	How about now?
SpongeBob	Now?
SpongeBob	Evening, sir. Hey, Granny, what's shakin?  Ooh, breezy today.
SpongeBob	All my shame went into here, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do.
SpongeBob	Oh, you won't believe what Le Spatula is capable of. Ready to show em buddy?  Oh, it's okay. No need to be shy. It's always tough the first day on the job.
SpongeBob	Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something.
SpongeBob	You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula.
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm so sorry.
SpongeBob	Good-bye, best friend.
SpongeBob	You can't rush perfection.
SpongeBob	Yeah, Squidward, don't you believe in magic?
SpongeBob	...you can throw all your dreams down the well. Although everyday the pain grows you ride unicorns on rainbows, if you throw all your dreams down the well. When your life's come apart at the seams and you've given up all your dreams, here is just the means to make those dreams come true. No more suffering, no more sighin', no more pain and no more cryin'.
SpongeBob	And I've got a date with a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	Thanks for the promotion. It sure is dark and scary down here.
SpongeBob	Hey!
SpongeBob	Patrick.
SpongeBob	Tag, you're it.
SpongeBob	Tag, you're it.
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Oh, the magic has gone missin' and everyone's still wishin' but their dreams have fallen flat upon the ground. You'll find magic under rubble so, Patrick, grab a shovel and here is where the magic can be found. We're at the bottom of a well but man won't it be swell, when we make everyone's wishes all come true.  Holy mackerel, look Patrick! We've struck magic.
SpongeBob	Guess what, Squidward? We found the magic.
SpongeBob	Tag, you're it.
SpongeBob	Stop it, Patrick, you're scaring him!
SpongeBob	You shouldn't fight in here. This is a magical place.
SpongeBob	We dug down deeper in the well and found the magic. Now all the wishes will come true!
SpongeBob	See, Mr. Krabs? She wished for that boat.
SpongeBob	Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!
SpongeBob	"And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties...  ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall!  Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time.  ""Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears.""  In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform  and assume my duties as...  ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff!  Oh, and I will be re..."
SpongeBob	Yes, Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	On patrol. I'm on patrol.  Uh-oh, an open window.
SpongeBob	Patrick. Come down here.
SpongeBob	Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in.
SpongeBob	Okay, now what?
SpongeBob	Get a hold of yourself, deputy.
SpongeBob	Where is he, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick,  the maniac!
SpongeBob	Whatever you say, cap'n.
SpongeBob	That's some good news, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Gary! No, dirty boy. This isn't like you.
SpongeBob	Oh, of course.
SpongeBob	Yupie.
SpongeBob	Gary? Gary?! Gary!
SpongeBob	Could a voracious flesh-eater do this? [he uses his body to slide through the door]
SpongeBob	Come on, Patrick, would a zombie have a picture of his best buddy in his wallet?
SpongeBob	No, don't hurt him.
SpongeBob	Easy boy. But what about Gary then? If he doesn't have a disease, why'd he bite all those people, including me?
SpongeBob	Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?
SpongeBob	I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation.  Hey, Gary.
SpongeBob	No work?! But what'll I do all day?
SpongeBob	I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique.
SpongeBob	I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick.
SpongeBob	Wait, it's not what you think.
SpongeBob	Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset.
SpongeBob	Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming...
SpongeBob	Patrick, shhh.
SpongeBob	Just take the next right.  Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off.
SpongeBob	It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a...  ...permanent vacation. That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known. Patrick's had his eye on my job all along. He's been scheming. They think I'm outdated. They think I'm all washed up. Well, I'll show them.
SpongeBob	Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television.
SpongeBob	Wow! That's more than I make in a year.
SpongeBob	Pa... trick... what are... you doing?
SpongeBob	Well, it's not, but that is an excellent idea.
SpongeBob	Why, thank you.
SpongeBob	I'm wearing a wig.
SpongeBob	Wig away!  Order up, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Take it off? But I can't, Mr. Krabs. My wig makes everyone so happy.
SpongeBob	I see you've noticed my new wig. Pretty impressive, huh?
SpongeBob	Uh, the name's SpongeBob and no, I am not meeting royalty. You must be referring to my regal appearance.  Thank you all for your kind words. I wish I could give you such nice wigs.
SpongeBob	Thank you, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Hmmm, I've never been tall before.
SpongeBob	For your information, Mr. Krabs, Squidward has locked me in the freezer, so I think I know what cool is.
SpongeBob	Hi, Sandy. What do you think?
SpongeBob	Oops. Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. [along with an angry Nazz] Hey, the wig broke my fall!  Mmm, popcorn.  Ah, you always come through for me.
SpongeBob	People, return your attention to the movie. I know my wig is glamorous and exciting but there is no need to start a riot.
SpongeBob	No matter what they say, you'll always be cool to me.  I'll never accessorize again.
SpongeBob	Everyone's wearing wigs! Everyone! I'm starting to feel a little betrayed. Hey, you made fun of me yesterday. I thought powdered wigs were uncool.
SpongeBob	Uh-huh!  Uh-huh!
SpongeBob	Oh!  Oh.
SpongeBob	What's a  reeeee?
SpongeBob	Can do, Sandy!  Hut-hut-hut, hut-hut-hut! Hut- hut-hut, huttidy-hut-hut!
SpongeBob	Can't. I'm guarding it.
SpongeBob	I don't think Sandy grew, Patrick. I think we shrunk.
SpongeBob	Sandy, where are you? Where are we?
SpongeBob	Give me that!
SpongeBob	Natural gas?
SpongeBob	I never thought it would end this way.  It's working!
SpongeBob	This stupid hammer won't break anything.
SpongeBob	Sure, Patrick, ya...
SpongeBob	Unset it, please unset it!
SpongeBob	I can't believe you're leaving, Patrick.  With all my pickles!
SpongeBob	You are Patrick Star, but you won't be for long.
SpongeBob	That's it. With the seaweed on your head, you could be a...
SpongeBob	The disguise is working, Patrick... I mean, Patricia.
SpongeBob	But she's not my girlfriend.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, this is Patricia.
SpongeBob	But if you reveal your secret identity, you'll have to leave Bikini Bottom!
SpongeBob	I won't let you do it. You'll have to do something horrible to me before I let you throw Patrick out of town.
SpongeBob	Ok.
SpongeBob	Oh, we're not here to ruin it. We're here to enhance it. Isn't that right, Pat?
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	What is that thing, Patrick?
SpongeBob	You can live here forever and ever.  Oh, look, Pat. He's crying tears of joy. Well, Smelly, there's one more family member you haven't met.  Smelly meet Gary.  Aww, look at that Smelly, Gary likes you.  Gary, no!  Gary.
SpongeBob	Hmmm, what's all the commotion?
SpongeBob	This isn't good.
SpongeBob	All right, I'll go down first. Keep a lookout and follow me.
SpongeBob	Run, Patrick, run!  Faster, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Oh, it's all right, Smelly. Soon, we'll be home and you can sleep in that cozy little pet carrier you love so much.
SpongeBob	Popcorn is served!
SpongeBob	Well, let the rotting continue, friend, while I impress and amaze you with...magic!
SpongeBob	Then take one card and shove it in your ear.
SpongeBob	It's all my fault.
SpongeBob	PATRICK!  PAT...!!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, the one mystic being that can help us: Mister Magic!  Just follow the brown-tiled road to the most mysterious mystic of them all! No one's ever seen him in person.
SpongeBob	I need your help to change him back.
SpongeBob	Oh, please.
SpongeBob	Are you Mister Magic?
SpongeBob	What are we going to do about Squidward?
SpongeBob	Sure, buddy. Patrick-a mayonnaise-ica.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I needed those.
SpongeBob	I'm a winner.
SpongeBob	I didn't get a license, Patrick.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive.
SpongeBob	I'm here for you, buddy.
SpongeBob	Like a winner.
SpongeBob	Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.
SpongeBob	Can we go home now?  We've been driving around your house for hours.
SpongeBob	4:00?  Who could be at the door at this hou  Now what is it, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep.
SpongeBob	Thanks for the ride.
SpongeBob	I used to have a dream.
SpongeBob	Uh-huh.
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.
SpongeBob	Are you sure you don't want to run him in?  It's a red light, Patrick!  Patrick, you just ran 3 red lights!
SpongeBob	I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!
SpongeBob	Patrick, what do you think you're doing?
SpongeBob	I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever.  Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy.
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	Patrick, what are you doing?
SpongeBob	Patrick, don't you worry. I got your back, man.  Hi there.
SpongeBob	That you're king!
SpongeBob	The king would like...
SpongeBob	Don't be ridiculous, Patrick. I'd never lie to you.
SpongeBob	Yes, sire?
SpongeBob	Uh, right away, your majesty. Umm, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Uh...  You know, Mr Krabs is probably wondering where I am...and...
SpongeBob	Well, would you look at that. Gary, you're royalty!
SpongeBob	Well, we're going to my house to have a little fun.
SpongeBob	Good morning Gary. Good morning jellyfish. Jellyfish? Jellyfish? Here, jellyfish. Oh, jelly!
SpongeBob	OK, he said he'll play better.  Uh-oh! That's not better!
SpongeBob	No; I don't know who you are, either.
SpongeBob	Bikers... coming... nasty... ferocious... take... over... town. Destroy... must hide!
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Like this, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Patrick, didn't you hear what I said?
SpongeBob	Me!
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	No, no, not that part. The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers.  What do you think, Patrick? Do I look though?
SpongeBob	Patrick, that's your salivation.
SpongeBob	Oh, no thank you, Patrick. I'm drinking diet blood.  See Squidward? We walk the walk but can we talk the talk? Do you want to join our biker gang?
SpongeBob	We'll just put you down as undecided.  Hi, Mr. Krabs. We're the Bikini Bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone.
SpongeBob	"Squidward, when have I ever been known to over-react?  Squidward! We're out of napkins!  Out of napkins!  Squidward! I accidentally removed the ""Do No Remove by Penalty of Law"" tag on my mattress! Hide me. Hide me.  Squidward! Squidward! I've gone blind.  Oh. Thanks, Squidward."
SpongeBob	Mild Ones?  Oh!
SpongeBob	Look around ya. Everyone's enjoying a delicious KelpShake.  Mm-mm. I'll be right back, Mr Krabs. I'm gonna get a refill.
SpongeBob	Well, good luck with that. See ya.
SpongeBob	You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets.  Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter, a two fisted Jumper, and a gold-throated stinger!
SpongeBob	Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever.
SpongeBob	Ah, I love jellyfishing.  Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable.  Ol' Reliable?  It's gone!
SpongeBob	Put one over there, Patrick.
SpongeBob	12 dollars and...  ...38 cents.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net.
SpongeBob	Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever.
SpongeBob	Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present.
SpongeBob	Patrick, we need to talk.
SpongeBob	What's in your hand, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Patrick wouldn't steal Ol' Reliable. Would he?
SpongeBob	Well, I'm off to work. See ya later, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Uh, you... what the...? What are you doing?
SpongeBob	Greetings, young fellow! I am willing to pay top dollar for jellyfishing items with sentimental value, if you know what I mean.
SpongeBob	Oh really?
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm the scary mustache guy!
SpongeBob	Because you said it. You said that it was your friend SpongeBob's!
SpongeBob	What'cha doing, best friend?
SpongeBob	Patrick, don't go. I'm sorry I accused you. It's bad enough I lost my net. I don't want to lose my friend, too. Please forgive me.
SpongeBob	Oh, come here, you big lug!
SpongeBob	Okay, Squidward, see ya later.
SpongeBob	How 'bout a game of Hangman?
SpongeBob	Just say hello to him, Squidward. You know how sensitive he is.
SpongeBob	Actually, Patrick, this is...
SpongeBob	Okay, pal!  Go get em', tiger!
SpongeBob	Bye-bye! What's the matter, actual-size Squidward?
SpongeBob	Hey, Gary.
SpongeBob	It's the best day ever
SpongeBob	Whoa! I gotta get to Sandy's!  Wait till Sandy gets a load of these adhesive karate gloves. Hyah!  Hyah!
SpongeBob	Yeah?
SpongeBob	Yeah, I won't be needing it now that I got my brand-new...
SpongeBob	Pull yourself together, man! I came for here a concert, and darn it, I am gonna get one!
SpongeBob	Now get in there and give me a concert to remember.
SpongeBob	But...
SpongeBob	This was supposed to be my perfect day. But then everything...  SIT DOWN!  Then everything turned to doo-doo.
SpongeBob	Well, I suppose. But then I was going to go jellyfishing with Patrick.
SpongeBob	You do?
SpongeBob	That's where it's at!
SpongeBob	It's the best day ever
SpongeBob	Patrick, I am truly honored and...
SpongeBob	No, not at all.
SpongeBob	No way, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Uh... I was digging a hole so I could get a better view of Gummy because he is so attractive and... Allow me to demonstrate.  See, Patrick, the view is beautiful down here.
SpongeBob	Hi, Sandy. Looks like I got myself into a sticky situation.
SpongeBob	Told ya. Save yourself, Sandy. Run away before you end up like me!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I have something to tell you.
SpongeBob	Well, it's still Best Friends Day. How would you like your Gummy back?
SpongeBob	Safe.
SpongeBob	Got your secret recipe, Mr. Krabs. You have no idea that went through to get here.
SpongeBob	Gosh, Mr. Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr. Krabs story at all.
SpongeBob	I'm adding the love!
SpongeBob	The Jim!?! He who flipped patties in the before times?
SpongeBob	Yes, sir.
SpongeBob	What's so great about a Jim Patty anyway?  Meh, it's OK.  Wow! That was... amazing!  Uh, Mr. Jim, sir?
SpongeBob	Please critique my work! I wish to learn at the feet of the master!
SpongeBob	Why, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Me?
SpongeBob	Look at them. Mr. Krabs is probably offering Jim my job right now.
SpongeBob	Wow! I never thought about it that way!
SpongeBob	Oh.
SpongeBob	The dark! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
SpongeBob	Yes, it's working...
SpongeBob	Night light?
SpongeBob	What was that, Gary?
SpongeBob	Wait, Patrick!  What is that, Gary?  Patrick, what are you doing!?!
SpongeBob	The darkness, Patrick. I can feel it. Like it's creeping up on us...
SpongeBob	You said it, Pat!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Mermaid Man. There appears to be a misunderstanding. Patrick and I put up those lights to scare away the creepy creatures of the dark! We weren't trying to summon you.
SpongeBob	The Moth, silly! Your archenemy. You'll be happy to know he won't be going anywhere anytime soon!
SpongeBob	Good...morning, Gary!
SpongeBob	Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy!  Wow!
SpongeBob	The moon! Can I go?
SpongeBob	Fine.  Put me in the brig, I don't mind!
SpongeBob	Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?
SpongeBob	Oh, hurry up!  These oughta do the trick.
SpongeBob	There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy.
SpongeBob	We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun...  ...house?
SpongeBob	No more!  Okay, one more.  Okay, that's enough. Let's go.
SpongeBob	Hey! You got your toothpaste in my peanut butter!  Patrick, I can do this!
SpongeBob	Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it!  Yeah!
SpongeBob	Patrick, do you know what this thing is?
SpongeBob	We don't want your money, moon man!  Look at them squirming around in there.
SpongeBob	Nice try, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face when she sees this!  Sandy, I'm back!  Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different.  Uh-oh...
SpongeBob	I'm waiting. I'm waiting.
SpongeBob	Why, sure.
SpongeBob	Me, too.
SpongeBob	Got to stay focused.
SpongeBob	My birthday party?  I missed... my... birthday party?
SpongeBob	That stupid toy! I wasted my whole life waiting for it!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, people like me don't deserve moments.  I get so caught up in...
SpongeBob	I waited so long...
SpongeBob	You! You ruined my free toy!
SpongeBob	Look, Patrick, Squidward fixed it.  How can we ever thank you?
SpongeBob	There you go, Gary!  Gary! Shame on you! I realize you're a bottom feeder, but have some manners! You know you're not supposed to eat goop off the ground! Now go on and enjoy your health food!
SpongeBob	What's what?
SpongeBob	Yeah?
SpongeBob	Bye, Patrick!  Ahh This feels better!  Let's see. A four-letter word, ooh. Meaning of uncomfortable sensation on the dermis Hmm  ITCH!!!  Don't worry, SpongeBob. Everyone gets itchy, swelling skin rash now and then. Just don't scratch it and it'll go away Eventually.  There! Outta sight, outta mind! Huh?  I won't let this minor setback hinder my fry cooking!  Now nothing can distract me from frying up those patties Except maybe this unbearable itchiness! Must Stop SCRATCHING!!!!
SpongeBob	Oh, that! It's nothing really, Squidward Just a little blemish, that's all!
SpongeBob	Where am I? Whoa!  Who are you people? I wanna go home!
SpongeBob	Patrick! Stop! Stop! You're gonna pop it!
SpongeBob	Patrick?
SpongeBob	Sorry I'm late, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob SquarePants, returning for duty, sir.
SpongeBob	Here you go, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Spy?! Whoo-ooh-ooh!
SpongeBob	Get rid of it! Get rid of it, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Wow, Sandy, with these gadgets, Patrick and I will be great spies.
SpongeBob	Wow, Plankton has to buy baby clothes?
SpongeBob	Hold on.  He's buying...
SpongeBob	I can't tell.
SpongeBob	Hmmm... mines, oil slick, smoke screen, shield...
SpongeBob	You're not paying me at all, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Good work, Patrick! Now it's my turn.  I thought you were holding the rope --
SpongeBob	Not to rain on your parade or anything, but you always lose.
SpongeBob	Plankton?! What the barnacles is going on here?
SpongeBob	You're me! Then I must be...
SpongeBob	That.
SpongeBob	Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet.
SpongeBob	Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts!
SpongeBob	Right back at you, Lenny!
SpongeBob	Hi, Thaddeus!
SpongeBob	Oh, that's-- that's-- I know him. It's-- something.
SpongeBob	Got to hurry, Gary.   The sooner I get to bed, the sooner I'll get to sleep, and the sooner I get to sleep, the sooner I'll wake up, and the sooner I wake up, ooh ho-ho!  The sooner I get to go to work at the best job in the whole wide world: The Krusty Krab!  Now, to just put on these sleepy time blinders, before I run excitedly to bed.  Well, good night, Gary.
SpongeBob	I'm on it!  Nothing a dedicated, on-time employee can't handle.  Kiddies get a free touch-up.  All done!
SpongeBob	A whole 60 seconds.
SpongeBob	I will.
SpongeBob	SpongeBob reporting for duty, sir.
SpongeBob	Here's my first month's rent.
SpongeBob	Eww, I guess I could use some freshening up.
SpongeBob	No, at the Krusty Krab. Now, if you'll excuse me.
SpongeBob	Do you want to know where the mustard is?
SpongeBob	Aye aye, captain.
SpongeBob	Oh, thank you, Mr...  My parents!
SpongeBob	Gary! Bad boy! No!
SpongeBob	You're welcome, Squidward.
SpongeBob	That's why I wore mittens.  Mm. Toasty!
SpongeBob	Can do, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Yes, sir.
SpongeBob	Not quite, Plankton. You'll have to get past me, first.
SpongeBob	Hey!
SpongeBob	The clamboni!
SpongeBob	And then, the ugly mollusk ran all the way home...
SpongeBob	It's the name of amusement, no...!
SpongeBob	What was your dream about, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Yeah, really fun.
SpongeBob	I guess we're not gonna be riding the Fist O' Pain today.
SpongeBob	Yeah, and then the Fist O' Pain will seem even cooler.
SpongeBob	Come on, closer.  That's it, a little more. Now hold onto his thumb. Give me a big smile.
SpongeBob	Well, the line looks a little bit shorter now. Can you believe that some people are scared of this ride?
SpongeBob	Hello, Larry.
SpongeBob	No thanks, Patrick. Um, you got ice cream in your eyebrows.
SpongeBob	I know, but the ride is really scary.
SpongeBob	I have to tell you something too, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Well, this is it, Pat.
SpongeBob	This is it, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I have a confession to make. I was really scared about going on this ride.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I don't want to face my fears. I'm afraid of them!  Good-bye, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Aw. well, we can help you. right, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Mr. Plankton? All this hard work is making us thirsty. Do you think we can get--  --a drink?
SpongeBob	La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
SpongeBob	Oh. It's okay, little greencreature. Patrick and I are going to keep working on The Chum Bucket. until it's the most pizzazziest restaurant in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! You've returned from your vacation.
SpongeBob	"Oh, Patty, a patty like you comes around once in a lifetime. I can't let them eat you. No, the job must come first. I can't let emotions cloud my commitment to the sacred fry cook oath: ""That which is fried, must be eaten."""
SpongeBob	Great idea.
SpongeBob	It's okay, Patty, the fire's gone. You're safe now.  Oh, I better, uh get the doorbell.
SpongeBob	Patty. Yeah, well, you two have fun with that.  Patty and I have to be on our way.
SpongeBob	Oh, I just got gussied up for my special dinner date.
SpongeBob	Here we are, darling. The best eatery in town.
SpongeBob	Oh, really? Mr. Fiver says different.
SpongeBob	Don't say such a thing, Squidward. Patty's just a little sick is all. Wight, Wubbie-Lubbie.
SpongeBob	Pay you no mind to that, wubbie-wubbie. I will always love you  Yeah, what is that smell?  Patty?  What happened to you?
SpongeBob	Can I get a doggie bag with that?
SpongeBob	Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots.
SpongeBob	Hmmm.. I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck?
SpongeBob	And...
SpongeBob	Are you kidding? I love them! Could the world's greatest fry cook do this?
SpongeBob	And watch this, Mr. Krabs. And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Yes, it is!
SpongeBob	Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Sorry, Patrick. We're all out.
SpongeBob	Uh-huh.
SpongeBob	Ah, the memories we've shared, right in this room. They're all here in this memory book.  Here we are on the Fourth of July. And Valentine's Day. Oh, you looked so cute on Easter.  What's wrong with Squidward?
SpongeBob	Uh, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Oh, this is so neat.
SpongeBob	You're not mad at us, are you, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?  Well, okay then. You look like you need some alone time. We'll be at the petting zoo if you need us.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick. Did you notice anything different about Squidward?
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah. I forgot. The new Squidward.  I guess I better get ready for work. Boy, the new Squidward sure is friendly.  The new Squidward sure is helpful.  Huh? The new Squidward sure is hygienic.  Boythe new Squidward sure is chummy.  Ah, this is more like it. Just me, my grill, and you, Mr. Smiley Face Krabby Patty. No one can come between us.
SpongeBob	Whoa! Squidward, what are you doing?
SpongeBob	But he's not a real fry cook.
SpongeBob	What's wrong with it?
SpongeBob	Yes?
SpongeBob	It's okay, Squidward.  It's a very okay cake.
SpongeBob	What are you talking about?
SpongeBob	How will that help them chew faster?
SpongeBob	I didn't know money could talk. Did it tell you to kick those old people out?  What do you have against old people?
SpongeBob	I really have to pee.
SpongeBob	[he walks up wearing a blue-purple fairy princess outfit. He also eats a corn dog. Under his outfit he has a diaper] Mr. Krabs, lookin' good.
SpongeBob	Ok,glad you're not insane.
SpongeBob	I challenge your gadget. I declare patty war!
SpongeBob	Foul beast, do your worst!
SpongeBob	We're limbo dancing to get ready for the dance-a-thon auditions.
SpongeBob	We're up, Patrick. Wish us luck, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Yep.
SpongeBob	Impressive.  Hey, Squidward, would you be our coach for the finals?
SpongeBob	How'd you know?
SpongeBob	Well, I just...
SpongeBob	Oh my goodness. I am honored to be in the presence of such divine talent.
SpongeBob	Uh, Squidward?
SpongeBob	I love your new dance, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Good morning, sir. What's with the new sign?
SpongeBob	Captain! My spatula's missing, sir!
SpongeBob	Oh, boy. what a day. What's next? A zombie invasion?  Mr. Krabs, open up! We're being attacked by a bunch of zombies that look like me.
SpongeBob	Wait! They're not zombies, Mr. Krabs. They're your customers look.
SpongeBob	Are ya ready to go, Patrick?
SpongeBob	It's an ad.  Dear Comic Book Reader.
SpongeBob	You can't always trust ads in comic books. Those X-Ray specs I ordered couldn't see through people's skin at all!  Only their clothes! Plus, you don't have $100.  Patrick, could you get my wallet?
SpongeBob	No.  Ow! Can I have my arms back?
SpongeBob	Oh, Patrick!
SpongeBob	You can play your records later, Gary. Patrick, is that why you've been having trouble writing?
SpongeBob	Patrick, don't strain yourself.
SpongeBob	Uh, Patrick?
SpongeBob	We need to get that song on the radio!
SpongeBob	I didn't know they could turn inside out like that. Now, how are we going to get your record on the radio?
SpongeBob	Well, it looks like Bikini Bottom is throwing a party. and you know what a party needs.
SpongeBob	That's not an angry mob, Patrick. It's your fan club!
SpongeBob	Oh, why'd she have to go to that science convention in Tejas?!
SpongeBob	I sure do miss that squirrel.  Her karate chopping,  that ten-gallon glass dome over her dome. And who can forget those buck teeth?  After Sandy gets back, we're gonna let her know just how much we miss her.
SpongeBob	That's quite alright, Miss Cheeks. As long you don't have a fierce no-partying policy.  First, cake, then we'll karate-chop, and then...
SpongeBob	Dig in, Sandy.  Uh...
SpongeBob	Don't you mean ride this down Scab Mountain?
SpongeBob	What's a flea?
SpongeBob	I need it more!
SpongeBob	Aah!
SpongeBob	Wait a minute. You had as much to do with this party as I did.
SpongeBob	It sure is good to have you back, Sandy!
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob	I'm waiting to watch it with you, Sillyfish! I'll be right over.  Sheesh, Patrick's so excited. I better not keep him waiting!
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Oh, Patrick! you  need to see this video!  I wanna give you this, because you're my buddy and... A donut this nice could really make a guy happy...
SpongeBob	Sure, pal!
SpongeBob	Spot, spot, spot!
SpongeBob	Aye-aye, sir. La-la-la-la-la-la-la.  You're a tough little guy, aren't ya?  This means war.  Wait here, please.  Say good-night, dried on filth. Ready. Aim. Fire!  That is the last straw! I want you to remember...  you made me do this.  Yaahhhh!  I got to finish this.  I'm afraid this is the last time we'll be meeting like this, my friend. Allow me to introduce you to... the Spot-Master 6000.  Notice, the microwave-powered laser particle beam. Notice, the laser-guided high pressure water cannon. And notice, the little surprise I installed just for you. A specially woven metal alloy ingeniously combined with state of the art cleaning materials.  I call it...  ...steel wool! And it comes with...  a laser! Any last words?  Mmm... I thought not. Power up.  Water cannon... on.  No effect. Steel wool laser... on!
SpongeBob	More power!
SpongeBob	Wooo-ooo!
SpongeBob	Police! Police!
SpongeBob	Plankton!
SpongeBob	What was that, sonny?
SpongeBob	Come back here, you little whippersnapper!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, what do we do?
SpongeBob	No offense, Mr. Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish.
SpongeBob	It's all yours.
SpongeBob	Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy.  Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Good-bye.  I won't be needing these.  Buzz, buzz, buzz.
SpongeBob	I'm happy here. This is my home now.
SpongeBob	Patrick! No!
SpongeBob	Don't mind if I do.
SpongeBob	It is great to be home!
SpongeBob	Nothing beats making quality food for good people with discriminating tastes.
SpongeBob	Testify!
SpongeBob	What's happening, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	I'm sure with all my years in the kitchen, I can make something other than...  Just warming up.  Come on, SpongeBob!  Just one egg then...  No, that's not it, no...
SpongeBob	The Krabby Patties, I almost forgot! These babies also belong to the Krusty Krab!  So long!
SpongeBob	Mr. Kra-a-abs?!
SpongeBob	You got it, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Hold on a second, Patrick! Its not the poor camera's fault you can't get a photo.
SpongeBob	I will try again...
SpongeBob	Not now, Patrick. This bubble's gonna break all records!
SpongeBob	My birth right?! Ow ooh, Ow ooh ow! Let's take this to the Bikini Bottom museum, they'll know what it is!
SpongeBob	Uh, whats an Atlantean omelet?
SpongeBob	Hoo hoo yeah, hoo hoo hoo!
SpongeBob	Pretty!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Comb flavored.
SpongeBob	Squidward, don't make any sudden movements!
SpongeBob	It looks like my front door!
SpongeBob	Excuse me, sir this tour has been great and all but uh, can we see the bubble now?
SpongeBob	Thank you Mr. Lord Royal Highness sir.  Just look at it Patrick. Ah the stories this bubble could tell. I just wish we could get a closer look.  Patrick! Get the--
SpongeBob	Great idea Patrick!
SpongeBob	We have to go back to Bikini Bottom now!
SpongeBob	It's not a joke, we burst the bubble!
SpongeBob	It's not gone, if you believe.
SpongeBob	I love Bikini Bottom! It's where my Gary is!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Squidward. But it's the end of our Atlantean vacation!
SpongeBob	But now we're done.
SpongeBob	Good-bye, Atlantis. We're Bikini Bottom bound. There's no place like home!
SpongeBob	We're Bikini Bottom bound!
SpongeBob	"Nice try, ""alarmy,"" but you've got to get up pretty early to wake me up on ""picture day!"""
SpongeBob	Still looking good Spongy, and Boating School is just around the corner.
SpongeBob	Well, I'm not sure how I did it, but I...
SpongeBob	Well, go ahead, but I don't have time to play right now. I am late for picture day, and I just can't seem to get to school without being covered by unsightly debris. If only I had a sealed barrier to protect me from the filth of the outside world.
SpongeBob	Uh, Patrick...
SpongeBob	Wait, can I go home and change first?
SpongeBob	Cheese.  There I am.  Hey, I don't look so bad after all!
SpongeBob	That's because you didn't hit the trash compactor switch.
SpongeBob	That's right, Gary, the cousin Blackjack. The same cousin Blackjack that used to beat me up all the time when we were kids.
SpongeBob	My sentiments exactly. Just imagine what he must look like now.  Hi, SpongeBob. It's been a while. Good to see that you're still a little man.  That brute has my parents. I gotta get over there.  Gary, I don't know how long I'll be gone. I don't know if I'll ever come back.
SpongeBob	Grandma? Are you talking to me from beyond the beyond?
SpongeBob	Cleaning up the mess?  I got to get help. I'll go to Uncle Cap'N Blue's. He'll know what to do.  Uncle Cap'N Blue, I need your help.
SpongeBob	Actually, I came to try to find my...
SpongeBob	Listen, Cap'N Blue. We don't have much time. Cousin Blackjack has my parents help captive at his house.
SpongeBob	You mean they won't give me a push on the swing set?
SpongeBob	They're trapped in the basement.  Mom, dad, quick! Let's get out of here.
SpongeBob	So you two aren't being tortured by Cousin Blackjack?
SpongeBob	That tickles.
SpongeBob	Whoa, stop.  There, there. You're safe now little lady.
SpongeBob	You ready to get crazy, huh, Crazyfish?
SpongeBob	Is too...
SpongeBob	I kept you up all night with my nocturnal outbursts? Again?
SpongeBob	I did something so dumb to myself that even you would laugh uncontrollably at me.
SpongeBob	Hmm...  Jack M. Crazyfish. You've never seen anyone like this guy, Patrick. He was about 60 feet tall.
SpongeBob	Uh, no, with a little hi-yah! and a ka-zow! and a gallon of hi-yah, hi-yah, ha! Yeah, he never knew what his him.
SpongeBob	Slugger, that's me.  What the?
SpongeBob	Lose? Sandy, I taught the fish who tangled with me a lesson he shan't soon forget.
SpongeBob	It all happened late last night...  I was walking home from work... alone when all of a sudden, Crazyfish sprang up out of nowhere. He threw a giant tire at the back of my head.  Then, he stood over me to gloat. I jumped up and karate kicked his hairpiece right off of its snaps.  He was so ashamed he ran all the way home leaving behind a pool of tears. Which I then proceeded to scoop up in my victory tankard and enjoy a nice refreshing beverage.
SpongeBob	Yeah, that's right, pal, do the right thing. Just keep on walking.
SpongeBob	All right, who said that? Was it you, grandma?
SpongeBob	Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache...
SpongeBob	Hi, Gary.  All right, look. I had a toothpaste tube, like this. But I couldn't get it open 'cause the cap was stuck. And I guess...I haven't been working my arms out that much lately. And I opened it up like this...  Then I was walkin', like this.  And I didn't see where the cap went, like this.  So, I slipped on it and I landed right on my wrench, like this. And I gave myself a black eye, like this.  Uh... like these.  So you see? I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid. Makes sense, doesn't it?
SpongeBob	All in the line of duty, Mr. Krabs.  Isn't it great, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Mermaid Man.  I brought you something to refresh your memory.
SpongeBob	Not so fast! You're not dealing with an ordinary fry cook! It's time for you to meet...  Fry Boy, Defender of... Ow!  Fry Boy...  ...Defender of the Krabby Patty!  Yes! You lose, Plankton! Now watch as the Krabby Patties' wholesome flavors work their magic!
SpongeBob	Well, then, you guys know where to go!
SpongeBob	Patrick, That's it! You can come with me to summer camp! Then I'd never have to say goodbye!
SpongeBob	Oh and quarter, thanks!  Boy, that looked like a boring boat to be on, huh, guys?  Guys?
SpongeBob	Funny you should ask... once I had...
SpongeBob	It was quite an enjoyable soap, but it wasn't until this guy got thirsty and decided to drink the bath water!
SpongeBob	The other campers just aren't having as much fun as you and me.
SpongeBob	Me, sir!
SpongeBob	All done!
SpongeBob	--and you--
SpongeBob	Me too!
SpongeBob	Hey!
SpongeBob	Sshhh!! We'll show Sandy we're tough as she is!  I guess the road smoothed out.  That was a close one Patrick! Almost left in the wilderness... without Sandy! Nobody would know where to find us!
SpongeBob	Whew! Uh-oh, well, we burnt our food, ruined our tent, and lost all our water. Patrick, we're going to need to use our razor-sharp quick wits if we're going to make it out of here alive!
SpongeBob	Uh, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Sure. Let's go play in that cave over there.
SpongeBob	What do you mean we'll be here forever? How long have you been here?
SpongeBob	Patrick's right. If I'm stuck here, I should make enough of it. I should build myself a new home.  There, just like my pineapple in Bikini Bottom...only, smaller,  comfy, safe and sound in my own little home.
SpongeBob	Hey Patrick.
SpongeBob	This mud replica of the Krusty Krab should protect me from that fiend: Patrick!  He's onto me! Must hide! . Ha,ha, I'm safe, Patrick can't get me in here, , I don't need to go outside, I have everything I need right here!  Spatula.  Now I just need some buns.  Oh, crunchy.  I can't take it!  I need some real food!
SpongeBob	I know what you're doing, you're playing dumb, but it won't work, because I'm going to eat you before you eat me!
SpongeBob	Thanks Patrick! You're a real pal! Funny looking bathbeads. They almost look like carrots. Carrots?! You're making soup out of me!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	Did what?
SpongeBob	...boop, boop, boop!  Your Krabby Patty, sir.
SpongeBob	There aren't any mollusks coming, are there, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Doesn't that hurt?
SpongeBob	Hi, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Well, there was my uncle Sherm.  He could stick an entire watermelon up his nose.
SpongeBob	So my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa SpongeBuck saved the town of Bikini Gulch! And everyone in it! I wonder what happened to the statue of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa.  It was much better than that one we have now.
SpongeBob	SpongeBuck was here all the long! Sorry Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. I didn't recognize you all covered in poop.
SpongeBob	Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum?
SpongeBob	Does everybody know about Opposite Day?
SpongeBob	I love... I mean, I hate Opposite Day.  I'm not ready!
SpongeBob	Company! I hate company. Who's there?
SpongeBob	You have?
SpongeBob	Meow.
SpongeBob	Say, want to help me do some work around the house, worst enemy?
SpongeBob	On Opposite Day it is.
SpongeBob	After you, Mr. Squidward.
SpongeBob	Yeah, everyone says that.
SpongeBob	Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer.  Please follow me.  And here's the worst room in the house. My gallery.
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	Patrick, do you ever feel Squidward likes us too much?
SpongeBob	Patrick, we have visual contact. Now taking evasive action. Subject still in close proximity. Over.
SpongeBob	I can't speak up Patrick, there's a jellyfish here and I'm worried it might sting me if I make any loud...  ... noises.
SpongeBob	Oh, I think I landed on my pain center.
SpongeBob	I don't know. I think there's something buried underneath it. And I'm gonna go get some shovels so we can dig it up.
SpongeBob	Well, there's gotta be a light switch around here somewhere. Found it. Excuse me, sir.  Hey, Patrick, look! We're moving! And here's the steering wheel!
SpongeBob	Bye, Squidward. Bye, Mr. Krabs.  Bye, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Could I interest you in a Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob	Thank you, sir, come again!
SpongeBob	Folks, have I got a deal for you.
SpongeBob	An abyss is a bottomless...  ...chasm!  Pat, we're falling!
SpongeBob	Then try one of our Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	No, it's a solid! It's a solid!
SpongeBob	We- We don't have desserts.
SpongeBob	There we were at the bottom of a deep, dark, abyss. And we had to let go of something heavy.
SpongeBob	Right by my side.  Wow, clothing that announces our feelings for each other  let's get them, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Patrick, look out, behind you!!
SpongeBob	Yeah, just like those guys.  Wow, best friend outfits like these really know how to make a statement.
SpongeBob	You mean you don't wash your hands, Patrick?!
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Oh, come on, we can work this out. We'll start a new life, just you, me, and this can of disinfectant spray.  Come on in, Patrick. Here, let me take your coat for you
SpongeBob	Clean!
SpongeBob	Not until you wash your hands!
SpongeBob	They are?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
SpongeBob	You're a stinky, stinky sea star. I bet you could use a shot of this!!
SpongeBob	Careful, Patrick, I got a weapon!
SpongeBob	You better stop that!
SpongeBob	Try me!
SpongeBob	It'll take weeks for me to get clean. I'll have to take 20 baths a day!
SpongeBob	Now that I'm filthy, I can spend all day getting clean.
SpongeBob	Mmm-hmm, he has embraced the truth.
SpongeBob	Good morning, Gary! Good morning, Mister Mailman!
SpongeBob	And, of course, the bestest pet.
SpongeBob	What's that?
SpongeBob	Sandy! What a neat robot!
SpongeBob	No worries, captain!  Oops, well, all in a day's work. Now, back to doing what I do best! No way I can mess this up...
SpongeBob	I'll miss you too, buddy. There's a year's supply of snail food for you.  Goodbye, pineapple.  Goodbye, Squidward. Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Sandy. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. Goodbye, life as I know it.  Welcome to Bikini Bottom. Population 538.  Minus 1.  Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy...  Oooh, boy, that's quite a lump.  I better not hit my head again. That might cause a concussion.
SpongeBob	Order up!  Who wants to be a dumb old mayor when you're the best fry cook in town? And how could I ever leave behind my bestest friend?
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah!
SpongeBob	Oh, doctor! Is he gonna be alright? For the love of Neptune, tell me!
SpongeBob	Two weeks? I'll never make it.
SpongeBob	Hiya Squidward! I've been practicing how to flop on my back.
SpongeBob	Are you sure that the patient has enough  emensmansera?
SpongeBob	You're right, doctor. Proceed with operation sever. Hold it!
SpongeBob	Yeah?
SpongeBob	Squidward, you're not handsome. You're a hunk!
SpongeBob	Well I'm gonna go clip my toenails Squidward, don't forget to enjoy being handsome.
SpongeBob	Well ok...
SpongeBob	Yeeks! Squidward! You're even more handsome now! And the crowd is in a frenzy.
SpongeBob	Squidward...
SpongeBob	All right, Jelly, out you go. It's been a lot of fun, but I gotta get to work.  Quite a wind this morning, eh Jelly.  Whoa!  Hey, Sparky, can you tell your friends I can't play right now?  Oh! I'm going to be late!  I told you I don't have time to play right now!  I have not been tardy one time in my career as a fry cook and I'm not going to start today!
SpongeBob	I am sorry, Mr. Krabs, but these jellyfish don't want me to go to work!
SpongeBob	I know I've said this 90 times already but... I love Krabby Patties I think that they are swell. They are the best There's no contest And now I'm going to yell. Whew!  I love Krabby Patties! I think they're swell. They're so neat and quite a treat And how I love the way they smell... La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.
SpongeBob	Actually, ma'am,  it was the absolute fun and deliciousness of a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	Ooh! Okay.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I-
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick! Thanks for helping out today!
SpongeBob	But what does that have to do with making Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob	Your shoe's untied!
SpongeBob	Does that mean you're not sending us to the Slammer?
SpongeBob	Cousin Stanley!
SpongeBob	Oh well, now I don't have to clean it out.
SpongeBob	Why not?
SpongeBob	Oh, that. That's me making Krabby Patties! The best job in the world. It's my calling.
SpongeBob	Oh, it's okay. I'm sure my friend Sandy can think of something. She's a scientist!
SpongeBob	That's perfect! Patrick can do nothing better than anyone!  You'll be learning from the master!
SpongeBob	Hey, what's wrong, Stanley? You're not still upset about that whole never accomplished anything in your life thing, are you?
SpongeBob	Uh...
SpongeBob	Well... guess I am, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Um...sir?
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Good luck on your new job, cousin Stanley!
SpongeBob	I was spying on you.
SpongeBob	No, not really... He traded me these 2 chocolate bars for it.
SpongeBob	You got it, Squiddy. Where are we moving her to?
SpongeBob	Wow Squidward, you're so strong!  And you split your sofa in half! It'll be really easy to move now.
SpongeBob	Thank you Patrick!
SpongeBob	Mix in some
SpongeBob	And when I'm done, I chop up some Love.
SpongeBob	You want me to join your band!
SpongeBob	Patrick, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Ew, really?
SpongeBob	Wow, Patrick, we're gonna be famous!
SpongeBob	Isn't this great, Plankton? Squidward is gonna help us!
SpongeBob	You know, Pizzazz!
SpongeBob	Whoo, yeah!  Dig that fancy follicle work!
SpongeBob	Ok, then, we'll keep your seat warm.  Patrick?
SpongeBob	I LOVE IT! It's kind of vague and mysterious.
SpongeBob	Or the adventures of
SpongeBob	Oh, my gosh! What do I do?
SpongeBob	Cheer up, Plankton. We've still got a whole week before our first gig at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Mm, that's tough. Don't worry, I'll hide you.
SpongeBob	Yes?
SpongeBob	Whoo, let's rock!
SpongeBob	Wait a minute Was this band just a front so you could steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula?
SpongeBob	Good morning, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Of course!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs seems to be in a good mood today.
SpongeBob	A penny? Sure.  Hmm, sorry. All out of pennies right now.
SpongeBob	Hmm-mm.
SpongeBob	Well, I do have a tie pocket though.  No, not in there either.
SpongeBob	What's the matter Mr. Krabs? Didn't you know I was a brain whisperer?
SpongeBob	The sounds are coming from back here. What the?
SpongeBob	Just like me!
SpongeBob	But, I really don't have a penny.  Huh, that's too bad. I really wanted to see that movie. Oh well.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! What is this metal detector doing on the floor? These should only be stored on special racks.  And you're not wearing your metal detector handling gloves!
SpongeBob	Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Hey, Gary, you can play with that.  Hey, this isn't gum at all.  It's just a dumb old $500 bill. This won't go with my chewed up gum collection. Ah well, good night, Gary.
SpongeBob	I've got one!  A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams...  ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh?
SpongeBob	The show! When am I going on the show? I have a great act!
SpongeBob	Wow! A full house!  There's Mom and Dad! They are gonna be so proud!
SpongeBob	Please, Squidward, let me be in the show! I'll do anything! Anything! Anything!
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward, listen, what do you think? When I mop, should I go forward and back? No, no wait, side to side.
SpongeBob	Barnacles! Just as we were getting to the nitty-gritty!
SpongeBob	"""...but such tragedies will be avoided with the flying boat of the future. The end.""  Time for a little shuteye before...  Oh, Mrs. Puff, can't this wait till tomorrow?  Hang on a minute, it is tomorrow!  Hey, wait! Hey! Mrs. Puff! Please stop the bus!"
SpongeBob	I assure you, I am well rested and ready to learn. Who knows, Mrs. Puff? Before the day is out you may have learned something yourself.  Hey, Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	Did you know in the future that all boats will be powered by dolphin manure?  Did you know that the H.M.S. Bluetoes was originally a racing boat before it became the royal family's private yacht? Do you know what scuttling is? What's bigger, a flotilla or a fleet? Did you know...  Ever been on a...
SpongeBob	I'd say this baby can hold up to... ten clam fishers.
SpongeBob	It's working! She's noticing my vast of knowledge! I can now taste the sweet, sweet lamination of a fresh boating license.
SpongeBob	"Oh boy, here it is! The main controls! Just look at all this stuff! There's the triple oscillator, and there's the hoist pulley, and there's the booby trap, and there's the long range mast knob, and there's a hot dog with extra mustard.  And there is the starter mechanism. That, right there.  A/C, hmmm...That's short for ""automatic conditionata"", and that's fancy  talk for ""Let's get this party started. Like, instantly!""   Whew.  Man, I'm glad that's over. Oh, that's a nice touch, what a soothing projection screen."
SpongeBob	Sure thing, Mr. K.  Mr. Krabs, you gotta get out here! It's a code blue situation!
SpongeBob	Whoo!
SpongeBob	[Squidward is enjoying the show] I can't sit here and watch this! That's my best friend out there!  Patrick!
SpongeBob	NO!  Patrick, now is not the time for eating, now is the time to avoid being eaten by that giant... Huh?  That's it Patrick! He's not chasing us, he's chasing those tasty, tender, delicious, succulent sausages around your neck.
SpongeBob	You mean that wasn't gastrointestinal distress?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squidward, we'll do it together!
SpongeBob	Broke your bottom, oh, Patrick, you're a card!  Whoa!
SpongeBob	The doctor will see you now, Mr. Star.  Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm.
SpongeBob	La, la, la...  La-la-la, la, la-la-la...
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Yes, yes, and yes.
SpongeBob	Yeah...
SpongeBob	Yup.
SpongeBob	Ok, see ya 'round.
SpongeBob	Hi, how are ya.
SpongeBob	You know it's a funny thing, Squidward. I smoothed out the edges of my personality and the rest just followed suit. Now I am utterly normal.
SpongeBob	I guess the decision to be normal was more life changing than I thought.  Hi, how are ya.
SpongeBob	I think I'll pass. But I do need to defragment my hard drive, would you like to help?
SpongeBob	Wow, that's something you don't see in the average house.
SpongeBob	Oh, what happened? I lost my job and my best friend and now I'm too normal for Squidward. Maybe I have taken this normal thing too far. No problem, SpongeBob. You made yourself normal. Now all you have to do is reweird yourself. All it'll take is a mental adjustment and some tight clenching. Now focus...  and clench.  Oh, well, if I'm going to get weird, I'm going to need to see a professional.
SpongeBob	Oh, thank you, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Normal is not worth it.
SpongeBob	"Gary, come and get it!  Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary?  Gary must have gotten an early start.  Rise and shine Squidward, you don't want to be late again.  Okay, see you at the Krusty Krab.  I guess Squidward needs his beauty sleep. Not everyone is blessed with my natural good looks.  Patrick, it's morning! You don't want to forget to wake up again.  Patrick? Okay, see you after work, sleepy head.  Slow day. Good night, Squidward. Good night, Mr. Krabs.  Gary, I'm home! Gary? You here, buddy?  Gary?  He hasn't touched his food!  Squidward! Open up!  Squidward, have you seen Gary? He's gone missing!  Squidward? Not a sign of Squidward anywhere. Squidward?  You up here? Hmm, Squidward's clarinet.  It's not even warm. Squidward's missing too!  Patrick, open up! Squidward and Gary are missing!  Patrick's gone too. What if everybody's gone?!  Mr. Krabs!  He's gone too!  Sandy! She's gone.  Where did everybody go?!  Go! Go! Go! Everybody's gone! But I swear that I will keep the memory of Bikini Bottom alive, by living out their lives for them.  SpongeBob, will you be quiet? You're disrupting my genius.  Mr. Krabs, sir, can I have a raise? """"[SpongeBob then sits in Mr. Krabs' chair and takes the form of Mr. Krabs] No! Now get to work!  Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir!  Excuse me sonny, may I have a Krabby Patty Deluxe please?  Right away, sir! I mean... whatever. Hey, SpongeBob, we got an order for a Krabby Patty Deluxe. Heaven knows why.  Coming up, Squidward!  Excuse me, Sandy, but may I have some more of this delicious iced tea?  Why sure! Whoops, just a sec.  Why sure now, SpongeBob.  Good morning, class. Can anyone tell me the first thing you do when riding a boat?  Ahem, floor it?  That's right, you floor it. Excellent work, SpongeBob!  Why thank you Mrs....  Pu... Pu... Puff!  This is pointless! I'm not Mrs. Puff! I cant replace everyone! I'll never be happy again! [he then walks up to a boat][boat drives away, SpongeBob then pulls it back up][SpongeBob gets in the boat and starts it up][SpongeBob starts driving it, causing destruction in Bikini Bottom][he falls asleep, and drives into Patrick's house, causing it to skid up, missing Squidward's house, and then crashes into the second story of SpongeBob's house] Good night, Boaty.  No! No!  NOOOOOOOOO!  Oh, Gary, I had a nightmare that all my friends were gone! And I was driving a-  So it was true! I... guess it's just you and me now, Boaty.  This is where I work. Do you want to help me cook up some Krabby Patties? Great!  Back when everyone was around, they used to enjoy these. Here, try one.  What? You don't like Krabby Patties? Huh! Well, I guess we can still make this work.  Whew. Boy, we learned a lot about each other today. You know? I thought I'd go crazy without all my friends and acquaintances around, but it looks like you were all I needed to stay sane!  What? A puppet of my old best friend?  Made entirely out of Krabby Patty Meat?  Oh, Boaty, you are a card.  Sorry, I'm late Patrick. Boaty was telling me a joke."
SpongeBob	Dear diary, not sure if I can trust any vehicle. Run for it as soon as the coast is clear.      Huh?
SpongeBob	A day? But you guys have been gone for weeks.
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Oh, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, can I do it today? Huh? Can I? Can I do it?
SpongeBob	Okay, good, 'cause these two Krabby Patties are ready!
SpongeBob	What's what?
SpongeBob	What thing where?
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	You mean my splinter?
SpongeBob	While it lasted? What are you doing?  W... What are you...?
SpongeBob	Please, Squidward! Don't tell Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	You're right, Squidward. I need help!  Please pick up, please pick up, please pick up.  Patrick?
SpongeBob	Uh, Patrick...
SpongeBob	I'm not!
SpongeBob	Please, Patrick! I don't want to go home early!
SpongeBob	What's what?
SpongeBob	Yes?
SpongeBob	What is the meaning of this?!  We're slide whistling!
SpongeBob	True Squidward, True. We have had our fun. But you know what's twice as much fun?!  twice as many slide whistles!!! After you my good man.
SpongeBob	Wow, Squidward! You have got quite an ear for music!
SpongeBob	Oh! We insist!
SpongeBob	Squidward, are you sure you don't wanna stop?
SpongeBob	Wow Squidward, listen to you! You're getting better already! Here we'll help.
SpongeBob	I'm living like Larry! Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob	De dee do dee do livin' like Larry. Dee dee dee doo livin' like Larry. Deedeedeedee livin' like Larry.
SpongeBob	"Well, wait a minute Patrick, I think your missing the point. ""Living like Larry"" doesn't mean throwing caution to the wind, and risking everything on a stunt that will cost you your life."
SpongeBob	"I wonder how Patrick's doing with his ""living like Larry"" thing."
SpongeBob	"I know that you might be angry at my friend for his shenanigans, but you are not the only victim. His reckless thrill chasing has made him a hollow shell of his former self. Just look  So let me assure you, his days of ""living in the moment"" are over. Can you not forgive him for what ever he did?"
SpongeBob	Oh come on Patrick, what happened to being in the moment?
SpongeBob	3-2-1 Lift off.
SpongeBob	I thought you left your swim suit at home.
SpongeBob	Wow Patrick, an invitation to our first summer shindig! And here it is!
SpongeBob	Why thank you.
SpongeBob	Ooh, Patrick, how do you feel?
SpongeBob	Uh, Patrick, it's time for me to get out.
SpongeBob	I must have been under the tanning machine too long.
SpongeBob	Huh, now I'll never get into that party.
SpongeBob	Oh, I think you'll have to go to the party without me Patrick. There's just no way I can get that golden brown in time. But that's no reason you shouldn't go.  Patrick, why did you...
SpongeBob	Oh, no! Caramel, hardening! Gotta get out of here.   Patrick? Patrick?
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick. Do you think that maybe too much sun is a bad thing?
SpongeBob	Wow, I wish I had a bottle of that kelp grow stuff.
SpongeBob	Oh yes, I agree completely. Come on Patrick, let's do some good deeding!
SpongeBob	There he is.
SpongeBob	Um, right, that thing that we did that day.
SpongeBob	Patrick, that's brilliant!!
SpongeBob	Right, too small.
SpongeBob	And we run around and scream like crazy!
SpongeBob	Oh, goodness gracious yes. Squidward is the nicest giant of them all.
SpongeBob	Patrick and I are having a sleepover, in your belly button.
SpongeBob	Since our last kindness didn't go so well, we brought you a new one.
SpongeBob	Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and...  Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true.
SpongeBob	I said, you're a...
SpongeBob	No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me.
SpongeBob	...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields.
SpongeBob	And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!
SpongeBob	What is fun? Let me spell it for you. F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, N is for anywhere, anytime at all!
SpongeBob	No! That's how you're suppose to feel!
SpongeBob	He's changed, I tell you!
SpongeBob	Why cant you just accept our friendship?
SpongeBob	Sure thing.
SpongeBob	What is it then? What do you see here?!
SpongeBob	How long were you planning on doing this?!  Tell me!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won.
SpongeBob	What about Patrick, does he have to find his own flowers too?
SpongeBob	Well Patrick, if you're so concerned about not having a nose, why don't you just get a new one stitched on to your face.
SpongeBob	Hiya Patrick. How... Woah! Hey, looking good.
SpongeBob	I can't work at the Krusty Krab looking like this. I'm out of uniform.
SpongeBob	It's the new nose that has betrayed us. My grandma SquarePants always says, punish the nose, not the man. But we're going to need something foul, something beyond foul, a stench that will blow the socks off his fungus-infested socks!  Okay, this should be stinky enough. I've gathered every sweaty sock, moldy pizza, and rotten piece of fruit in Bikini Bottom.  With a little raw sewage for good measure.
SpongeBob	You wanted to see me, sir?
SpongeBob	NO!
SpongeBob	Yes?
SpongeBob	Right away sir.
SpongeBob	With this.
SpongeBob	You and I are going to need to do a little detective work!
SpongeBob	Why don't you tell me. Is it?!
SpongeBob	And so the truth floweth forth.
SpongeBob	Well, he's clean. But if Plankton didn't steal the ingredient, who did?
SpongeBob	I'm onto you, squirrel.  You thought no one could figure it out, but I pieced it together. I know exactly how you got all those patties.
SpongeBob	283 Krabby Patties.  That's right, I cooked this order. I guess this means you didn't use a laser beam, or invisibility.
SpongeBob	Yeah, you're right, Gary, that is impossible. I never would have stopped to pull up my sock during a pickup.
SpongeBob	Open up in there, Tentacles! We know you're in there! We just want to ask you a few...  Not cooperating.
SpongeBob	Yes! Because you can't make Krabby Patties without...  tap dancing shoes?
SpongeBob	I know, Mr. Krabs. It just slipped away from me somehow.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, isn't that the stolen secret ingredient?
SpongeBob	Oh, you can count on me sir.  Pardon me, you smart fellow? Down here.  Why settle for Plankton's lumpy Chum, when you can enjoy a steaming Krabby Patty, for free?
SpongeBob	Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, keep your tiny pants on Plankton, bleep bloop.  There's your Chum, bleep blap blop.
SpongeBob	Interesting.
SpongeBob	Quickly, now is the time to make a hasty retreat!
SpongeBob	Okay!
SpongeBob	Chocolate rain!  Squidward!  Squidward, wait!
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	Why?
SpongeBob	Psst, Squidward, sit here. Here.
SpongeBob	Oh, I am here because I.
SpongeBob	Ah, lunch time, eh boating buddy?
SpongeBob	I got it, I got it.
SpongeBob	Okay Squidward, if that's the way you want it.
SpongeBob	Yay!
SpongeBob	Like two more satisfied regulars, Mr. K.
SpongeBob	Oh! My very own press badge!
SpongeBob	Meaning of what, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff is going to laugh her hat off when she reads this!
SpongeBob	Very interesting...
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, can I have a word with you?
SpongeBob	Yeah, I... I know.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, you wouldn't!
SpongeBob	I've seen people's lives ruined, with my own eyes!
SpongeBob	Ahh-ahh, it's a surprise.
SpongeBob	Yee-hee! Slumber party!
SpongeBob	You know how girls are.
SpongeBob	I dont think this is the scary part yet.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs...
SpongeBob	Leave it to me, Mr. K. Ive got the perfect disguise.
SpongeBob	Y-You didnt?
SpongeBob	Theyre on to us, Mr. Krabs! Drive!
SpongeBob	Piano repair man!
SpongeBob	Yes, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Give me one good reason why I cant stay!
SpongeBob	So if I prove Im fun, can I stay?
SpongeBob	These old newspapers are confetti in fun hands! Whoo!
SpongeBob	Fun!
SpongeBob	Well, Mr. Krabs, you know how boys are.  Ow!
SpongeBob	Gary? Ohhhh! Gary? Oh, hi ya, Squidward.  Whoooooooaaaaaa! Ohhhhhhhh! Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary, there you are. What are you doing here? Well, today is the day you show everyone else you're the best pet in the whole world. Now, for a quick checklist. Let's see, eye reflects. Check. Slime viscosity.  Hi, Squidward.  Ready! Hi again, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Luxurious mane?
SpongeBob	Pedicure? I didn't realize how much went into this.
SpongeBob	Enough dilly-dallying! We got to get down to business!
SpongeBob	Because we have got to show those other pets we are just as fancy as they are.  Oh, come on, Gary. Don't be this way. I'm doing it for you, not me.
SpongeBob	Hello! Sorry to bother you. Just wanted to get your opinion on my snail, Gary.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Gary. He'll be back in time to see us win first place. Now let's go scope out the competition.
SpongeBob	Boy these pets are gussied today. Maybe I need a top hat or something to class it up a bit. Gary? Oh, thanks for reminding me. I didn't know your collar was loose.  Now, let's go get that top hat, buddy. Uhhhhhhhhhh! There you go.
SpongeBob	I speak a little bit, sir. I know what they're saying. They're saying: Owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners. Please, please, please, please please, please, please don't be this way. They're saying they don't want this type of pampering. They want to be treated as companions, not dress-up dolls. They don't want scratchy outfits, they want to be scratched! They are protesting the indignity of wigs and jewel-encrusted collars and they want to be free from superficial and degrading pageants, like these.
SpongeBob	Did you hear that, Gary? They're rewarding you for standing up and speaking out against injustice. Maybe these pageants aren't so superficial after all.
SpongeBob	The fan... it...
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Ha, ha, ha!! That's a good one Patrick: on-board! Whoa!
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	How did you guys get here?
SpongeBob	So what did you say this house is made from again?
SpongeBob	Cool!
SpongeBob	What's he saying?
SpongeBob	How far up stream did you say it was?
SpongeBob	Oh, don't worry, Squidward. He'll be here.
SpongeBob	It's JKL! Hail O great swami of the Gnarly Pounders! We seek audience with thee.
SpongeBob	Isn't Jack Kahuna Laguna the most totally awesome surf guru you've ever met, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Yup.
SpongeBob	AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
SpongeBob	JKL, thanks for teaching us how to surf.
SpongeBob	It's... the Big One!!!!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! Hop on or you'll be stuck here forever!
SpongeBob	JKL!
SpongeBob	JKL!!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I know I heard a terrifying shriek.
SpongeBob	The terrifying shriek mustve come from this clam.
SpongeBob	Oh, and you were coughing because you got something stuck in your throat?
SpongeBob	Hey, what about the clam?
SpongeBob	Well, then, what could it be?
SpongeBob	Good idea coming here, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Well, thats my specialty.
SpongeBob	Hello.
SpongeBob	We found it deep in Jellyfish Fields.
SpongeBob	Well, that looked like the last of them.
SpongeBob	Wow, your dad really told you that?
SpongeBob	Patrick, whered you go?
SpongeBob	Best shopping day ever! Patrick, I got an idea!
SpongeBob	So tell me, whatd you buy?
SpongeBob	Thanks.  There you go.
SpongeBob	Thats okay, I already got my ice cream. See?
SpongeBob	Its a deal!
SpongeBob	Oh, Patrick, these arent strangers. These are 497 of my closest friends. Right everybody?  That right!
SpongeBob	And I told him, its not that I mind the macaroni, what I mind is
SpongeBob	Noooooooooo!  Well, everyone, I hope this doesnt put a damper on things, but I just checked and, well its just that all my money is  gone.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I was wrong.
SpongeBob	You got another new volleyball?
SpongeBob	Squidward? Where are you going, all dressed up?
SpongeBob	A fancy party?
SpongeBob	All except for that last one.
SpongeBob	La! La! La! La! La! La!.
SpongeBob	Perhaps Squidward didn't see me.
SpongeBob	Now I have a captive audience!
SpongeBob	Stooop! Stop Stop!
SpongeBob	O Sole Lo Mio...
SpongeBob	Laaaaaaaaaaa. Figaro, Figaro, Fiii-ga-rooo!
SpongeBob	A mustache?! FOR ME?!
SpongeBob	Fi-ga-ro!  Fi-ga-ro
SpongeBob	All thanks to my state-of-the-art work set.
SpongeBob	Wow, really? That'd be great Sandy! I can see me now.  Yeah... that would change everything!
SpongeBob	I'm-fee-ling-some-thing!
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Thank...You. I've been working out. Excuse me a second.  Yeah. Anyone up for the...  ...juice bar?
SpongeBob	I remember when I used to look like you, too.  But, that was a long time ago.
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Yeah, your workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me.
SpongeBob	Now? Wait, uhh, wait, Sandy. I don't think it's such a...  Sandy, wait!
SpongeBob	Wait!
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah. Great. No problem.
SpongeBob	96. 97. 98. 99. 100.
SpongeBob	Where are you taking us, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	And it smells angry.
SpongeBob	The act?
SpongeBob	And together we are...
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	Actually, we're here to fake wrestle.
SpongeBob	Oh, don't be afraid. It's just them.
SpongeBob	Whoa.
SpongeBob	Did you need something, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Thanks, Patrick. Now you try saying something intimidating as well.
SpongeBob	That tickles.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, we're having so much fun. Doesn't that make us winners?
SpongeBob	Hey, Quincy! How's my favorite money-man?
SpongeBob	I know, I know. It's so embarrassing.  I wanted the one with the kittens on it.
SpongeBob	Well, I'll have you know that this is for Mermaid Man. And I'm not leaving until I have money that shows him the proper respect.  Whoa!
SpongeBob	All right!
SpongeBob	How much is it? For this one?
SpongeBob	Number fifty-four! That's the best card there is!
SpongeBob	I can't let anything happen to that card. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy would never forgive me! Patrick, watch out! You almost tripped on that crack.  Whew! Now watch where you're going!
SpongeBob	The card!   Patrick, why'd you just walk into Goo Lagoon?
SpongeBob	You mean...  you'd give me your most valuable possession?
SpongeBob	Um, sure Patrick.
SpongeBob	No, wait, Patrick! Allow me to clean it!
SpongeBob	Now I'll never have Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy card #54, the special talking one!
SpongeBob	May I... have one?
SpongeBob	Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Ah! You are?!
SpongeBob	But, Mr. Krabs, these are all the same size cup.
SpongeBob	How long?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs said you were gonna teach me all about the Vikings.
SpongeBob	Squidward, do you think Vikings really drink their beverages in Viking Size?
SpongeBob	There's so much more about Vikings that I wanna find out.
SpongeBob	What's that, Squidward? I couldn't here ya. I was.... ooh.
SpongeBob	How interesting.
SpongeBob	Nice to meet ya.
SpongeBob	Anything else?
SpongeBob	Well, Mr. Krabs tells me I'm pretty good with a spatula.
SpongeBob	If it means saving my best friend, then yes.
SpongeBob	Guys, you just ran into a piece of ice. No one's forsaken you. There's a breach in the hull over there. You just gotta patch it up.
SpongeBob	Pardon me, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Now that's what I call a Viking-sized adventure!
SpongeBob	And tarnish my reputation of never missing one day of school? I couldn't. Besides, that would be lying. And lying is wrong.
SpongeBob	Patrick, is this really neces
SpongeBob	Nothing. Nothing.  That's it!
SpongeBob	The bathroom key!
SpongeBob	Hi, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, will you sign our books?
SpongeBob	Wait up! You don't even have a net! Patrick!  Wow. Neptune's scepter, I don't believe this!
SpongeBob	You're free to go, guys.
SpongeBob	Well, this certainly has been a glorious day, but I better get back to class.
SpongeBob	No! I gave Mrs. Puff my word, and I shall not betray her!
SpongeBob	Is this the one when the lowest score wins?
SpongeBob	Well, I better be off now.
SpongeBob	No, no, no, no...
SpongeBob	Ohh! I never returned Mrs. Puff's bathroom key! I can't give up now!
SpongeBob	I didn't know your grandpa was a pirate, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Swarthy! I mean...shiver me timbers!
SpongeBob	Oh!!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! It happened again, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	These camouflage outfits should help us find out what Squidward's secret Wednesday secret is!
SpongeBob	Huh! How did you know?
SpongeBob	Hey, where's Squidward?
SpongeBob	We just came to explain that Squidward had no idea that we followed him to the lodge. So, it's not his fault.
SpongeBob	Squidward, wait! I'm sorry we got you kicked out of your lodge. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
SpongeBob	So anyway, Squidward, I was thinking we should be working on our secret lodge initiation.
SpongeBob	Oh, sure he does. He just needs a little push.
SpongeBob	Oh, we didn't kidnap you. We just brought you here for...
SpongeBob	Ow! Ooo, ooo! Ow!  Brother Patrick.
SpongeBob	Do you still wanna be a Feather Friend?
SpongeBob	It is. Time to break out the heavy artillery.
SpongeBob	Way to go, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Any plans after work?
SpongeBob	Oh, please come over for a visit, Squidward!  It's been so long! I can't even remember your last visit!
SpongeBob	Hey-ho, Squidward. You got any...
SpongeBob	"He said he wouldn't leave the comfort of his own home for my ""dirty little hovel""."
SpongeBob	Oh-okay, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Squidward!  It's been a while since I last got a call from my favorite next-door neighbor!
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward is finally coming over for a visit!
SpongeBob	Would you care for a cool and refreshing iced tea?
SpongeBob	Blancmange?
SpongeBob	You yelled?
SpongeBob	Squidward, the rash cream.  Oops.  Oh, no!  I don't think I have a cream for that.
SpongeBob	Aw, don't worry, Squidward. You're more than welcome to stay at my home until you get your house fixed.
SpongeBob	It's laundry day, Gary!  Oops.
SpongeBob	Actually, Patrick, I'm kind of busy. Can it wait?
SpongeBob	Oh.  No. Nope. Ew, not these. Uh-uh.  Whoa, these pants fit my body better than my own mother!  Hey, Patrick! Notice anything different? Pose. Pose. Pose. Pose.
SpongeBob	Sandy didn't recognize me either. These pants are more powerful than I thought. Course it was just Sandy, and Neptune knows what goes on inside a squirrel's head.  But I know my best buddy Squidward will recognize me. We have been through so much together.
SpongeBob	Oh, sure you do. It's me, SpongeBob... SquarePants.
SpongeBob	Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah! Lots and lots of felonies.
SpongeBob	My first day on the job. I am so excited. Woo-hoo!
SpongeBob	So what do I do first?
SpongeBob	Hmm, I'll go, too.  How's it going in there, boss?
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	I mean, do these pants look square to you? They're round.
SpongeBob	Order up, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Oh, sure thing.
SpongeBob	I know!
SpongeBob	Okay!
SpongeBob	Patrick, go home and check your mailbox.
SpongeBob	We're also, certified Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy impersonators.
SpongeBob	Shuffle boarding is exciting, huh Patrick?
SpongeBob	Wha?
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	Their mommies?
SpongeBob	Well maybe somebody should have thought about that before they ponied up for the world's greatest patty! Mr. Jail Warden!
SpongeBob	Oh, I think we've done our work Patrick. Now, let's return these costumes.
SpongeBob	Look at him Patrick! Plotting with his evil minion!
SpongeBob	Alright Mable, that's enough chitchat! Now are you gonna come quietly, or will we have to take you to jail by force!?
SpongeBob	Whooooaaaaa!
SpongeBob	Just keep moving.
SpongeBob	And then some!  That's a good one!
SpongeBob	Wow, only eight minutes in and we've already been given a math quiz. Very advanced music class, huh, Patrick?
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Professor Squilliam.  Patrick here keeps tickling my foot.
SpongeBob	Like this.
SpongeBob	Wha...? Where am I? I felt like I was in some sort of horrible trance.
SpongeBob	But it's not Tuesday, Patrick.
SpongeBob	I got it! I got it!  I got it! I got it! I got it!  Remember Patrick, finders keepers.
SpongeBob	But he still feels cold.
SpongeBob	No, no, that part goes here.
SpongeBob	I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's... He's... He's pushing up daisies!
SpongeBob	Please, Mr. Squidward's ghost!  Spare us your ghostly anger!
SpongeBob	Here?
SpongeBob	Too tired...
SpongeBob	Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it.
SpongeBob	I can't do it!
SpongeBob	Patrick, it's this way.
SpongeBob	Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman.  It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?
SpongeBob	We're going to put you to rest.
SpongeBob	But you said we could put you to rest.
SpongeBob	No, just into this hole.
SpongeBob	Go home.  But Master--
SpongeBob	Patrick, say that again.
SpongeBob	Never mind. I've got an idea.
SpongeBob	All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond.  Goodbye, friend.
SpongeBob	Patrick, maybe we should play something that involves less thinking.
SpongeBob	You're right, Patrick. I'm sorry we destroyed your nest little worm. I promise it won't happen again.  Look Patrick!
SpongeBob	Oh hi Gary, are you ready to meet your new friend.
SpongeBob	Okay Patrick see you later then.  Aaaaaaaahhhh......
SpongeBob	He's in here.  Oh! I can't watch!
SpongeBob	Here Gary right in here. They're gone asleep.
SpongeBob	How would you like to have your very own pet baby worms?
SpongeBob	Good morning, Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, little worms. I know a place where we can find go to find homes for every single one of you.  Good morning, ma'am. How are you today? Could I interest you in some...  Ma'am?  That whistling. It's Larry Lobster! Hi, Larry, what are you up to?
SpongeBob	Oh, Larry, wait.
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, I came as fast as I could--
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Oh, well. At least I still have you guys.
SpongeBob	What's that?
SpongeBob	Uhhhhh, uuh uuh.
SpongeBob	Ahoy, sir. Where are you going?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Naptime's over, Squidward. Now what do you say we work real hard until Mr. Krabs comes back?
SpongeBob	Do you care now?
SpongeBob	Regulary scheduled nap?
SpongeBob	Um, nothing. Carry on. Boy, there sure is a lot of proceedural type stuff I don't know about the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	And unclog the sink.
SpongeBob	Me?
SpongeBob	Oh, a little cashier told me! Follow me!
SpongeBob	Order #12!
SpongeBob	Oh! . It's all coming clear to me now.  There you are. A nice hot meal with sanitary foot service. Here's a nice delicious Krabby Patty, and a large drink.  Enjoy.
SpongeBob	There's another secret? What's the secret?
SpongeBob	"You mean, ""lookin' bad""! Enjoy our fine decor!"
SpongeBob	Initiating stage two: collateral damage!  How was that?
SpongeBob	Don't touch the material.
SpongeBob	And a hey, and a ho, and a hey and a ho! And a hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, ha, hey, hee, ho...
SpongeBob	Oh, hiya, Sandy!
SpongeBob	Of course not! Have I ever let you down before?  Hello?
SpongeBob	Yes, sir?
SpongeBob	Umm... Well, actually...
SpongeBob	No need to remind me! I wouldn't forget about my best buddy's birthday!
SpongeBob	Tonight?
SpongeBob	You can rely on me, sir! I wouldn't wanna jeopardize my employee record.  Ok, let's see what we got here. Oh, it says on page 472 section C-17 that you need a right-angled motorized hex drill to assemble this thing.
SpongeBob	Heh, oh, hey, Patrick! What're you doing in town?
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah, that! I w... I was just getting to that! That's why I was here in town! Forget your birthday cake! You're hilarious, Star, you really are! Now, you just go home, and I'll get your cake, you silly guy, you!  Hi! I need a birthday cake!
SpongeBob	Oh, hi! I was just, uh, making sure you had your hardware!
SpongeBob	It must be that spicy kelp I ate earlier. I gotta go use the lavatory. I'll be right back!  Happy birthday!
SpongeBob	I've got it, it's right here!  Tada! See, all wrapped up and ready to go!
SpongeBob	Oh, barnacles.
SpongeBob	Sardines! Yeah, I was attacked by a can of wild sardines. Now let's finish this telescope.
SpongeBob	Not even for a minute?
SpongeBob	"I've got something to say. I've got something to say. I've got so... I have got something to say!  I know you all had important things tonight. Mr. Krabs, your telescope. Patrick, your birthday. Sandy, you have this big presentation. I just couldn't say ""no"" to any of you."
SpongeBob	What are you doing out here, silly?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Patrick. I'll be back from work at six. We can play then.
SpongeBob	What's the matter, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Are you okay?
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick... How are you feeling after your first day on the job?
SpongeBob	Just be careful, hm?
SpongeBob	Mr Krabs, you can't let him do this, he might get hurt!
SpongeBob	Patrick, you OK?
SpongeBob	Anytime, pal! Anytime!
SpongeBob	Well, I guess we could play something. How about a yo?
SpongeBob	How about this?
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward. Can you think of anything fun we can do?
SpongeBob	Well, we're here.
SpongeBob	Look.  Wow!  Patrick, look at that.
SpongeBob	Toys! Glorious toys! La, la, la! Toys! Yeah! Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Aw. The store's closing. We'll have to leave now.
SpongeBob	Hide? Isn't that kinda sneaky?
SpongeBob	Nothing can ruin it!
SpongeBob	You have Night Vision?
SpongeBob	Calm down, buddy. We just need to find a light switch. But ya have to put me down first.
SpongeBob	Gah!!!  Eeeeeeee!!!
SpongeBob	Ready, Patrick?
SpongeBob	My eyes!!
SpongeBob	That's shin dig buddy. We're spending the day at the beach in the honor of our best friendship.
SpongeBob	I'm going to the beach with my best friend!!!  Ooohhhh buuusss drrrivvver!
SpongeBob	No! No! Patrick! No one is ever going to find us out here!
SpongeBob	Perfect! Now run along, Patrick and I'll  toss it to you!
SpongeBob	I know, we can make sand castles!
SpongeBob	I'm just trying to help, buddy!
SpongeBob	I better build a wall just in case King Pinky gets any funny ideas.  Oh sir, you built onto my side.
SpongeBob	"Okay Patrick, I can accept that. No more destruction from this point forward, okay? Okay, back to square one again.  I hereby propose a non-aggression treaty to end hostilities between our two kingdoms.  Patrick, by signing this historic armistice you have brought peace to our lands. May your kingdom prosper! Well that went well!""  What are you doing!? What about the treaty!?"
SpongeBob	Come on!  How do you like them apples
SpongeBob	All is fair in love and war my friend slash enemy, or should I say, my friend-enemy!?  Now let's have some real fun!
SpongeBob	I'll tell you what happened Patrick... I got carried away.
SpongeBob	No, I can!
SpongeBob	Hello, HELLO!  Huh? The lines been cut.  Barnacles!
SpongeBob	HA, HEY!  Ah Ha! Wind-Up novelty teeth. How did you wind up down here .
SpongeBob	Gary?  Noooooooooo!
SpongeBob	Gary, I... I broke your shell!
SpongeBob	How about this?
SpongeBob	OK, your right it's not a shell.  OH!  Greetings, earthlings. I am SpongeBob. I come from the future. DA-HA-HA-DA-HA-HA.  I bet this'll look great. . Eeewww. I can see why snail shells aren't clear.  Hmmmm.
SpongeBob	Commercial? What commercial?
SpongeBob	Now it... really looks like the old one hey buddy?
SpongeBob	Oops, sorry Jack. HEY, how much is that one?
SpongeBob	Ah that is bright. Can't... see! OW, what was that!?
SpongeBob	WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! Before we do the hand-off, let me make some precautionary measures. Okay, first,  shoes are tied, hands are de-ry  and now a thick layer of bubble wrap
SpongeBob	Are you really angry or ya just trying to sound louder?
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary it's not that bad! Square looks good on anybody!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs. What are you doing here?
SpongeBob	Nothing, Mr. Krabs. I'm broke.
SpongeBob	Oh, sorry Gary, I'm not used to your new shell.
SpongeBob	Yes Sir?
SpongeBob	Four.
SpongeBob	One.
SpongeBob	Hey, that's my legs.
SpongeBob	Hi! I don't want a free sampl-
SpongeBob	And that's the story of how I got my head stuck in the fry vat.
SpongeBob	No. No. Not bitterness. Despair. And it's coming from over...  this way.  Plankton! What's wrong, Plankton?
SpongeBob	We've got a  love emergency!  Attention everyone, we've got a love emergency!  Please stand back. Love emergency. Thank You. Love emergency. Plankton, there's only one thing you need to do. You need to give her a present from  in here.
SpongeBob	Love.
SpongeBob	...uhh...
SpongeBob	Thats it! You've taken your first steps into the hall of luh-uv. Now tell me more about your Karen
SpongeBob	Does she have any hobbies?
SpongeBob	Not to worry when you finish you'll be as  golden voiced as me.
SpongeBob	Oh, when the time comes, you'll know. The music she'll love comes from inside.
SpongeBob	Get in there and sing, you single-celled Romeo, you.  Ah, love.
SpongeBob	Control, Alt, Delete.
SpongeBob	I am so fired.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, what's wrong with Pearl?
SpongeBob	No, that was Patrick who brought his mom. Besides, how am I supposed to compare with Pearl's old boyfriend, Mr. Long, Tan and Handsome?
SpongeBob	Well, I guess the first thing we should do is...
SpongeBob	Just a second.  Cheese!  That'll be a keeper.
SpongeBob	What is it?
SpongeBob	The Whack? Oh, yeah, I invented that one.
SpongeBob	Hot dog.
SpongeBob	Let's go!
SpongeBob	Good Morning, Gary!
SpongeBob	Krabby Patty!  Yummy!  Good times.  Oh, sorry, Gary, we can reminisce later. I gotta get ready.
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	I thought you said that I was going to be in charge of decorations.
SpongeBob	Yee-haw!
SpongeBob	Your change, sir.
SpongeBob	Ready? Set?  Guys, I'm okay. No need to scream.
SpongeBob	Not to worry, Squidward. I have the entire map memorized.
SpongeBob	Oh. My house is on TV. All of our houses are on TV.
SpongeBob	Thank you Mr. Krabs. Dental hygiene is very, very important.
SpongeBob	Lead them? I can finally  use my leader hat...  and my lederhosen.
SpongeBob	Ow!
SpongeBob	Well, okay. Mr. Krabs called me into his office.
SpongeBob	But, Squidward, you're glad I moved in. Remember that day.  ah-uh.  Nah.  No.
SpongeBob	Remember the day Sandy and I got married?
SpongeBob	I'm ready, I'm ready to go to work.
SpongeBob	I'm ready, I'm ready to go to work.
SpongeBob	Well, hello.  Are you okay?  Mister?
SpongeBob	Guys, we can't give up now. We got into this mess together, and we'll get ourselves out of it the same way.
SpongeBob	Okay. This is the one. Feel very good about this. Okay. Ready?
SpongeBob	Oh!
SpongeBob	I said, are you with me people?!
SpongeBob	Happy anniversary, Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	I see you even brought your double net.
SpongeBob	Good idea.
SpongeBob	Start dec you sir, obviously do not recognize fine decorating when you see it.
SpongeBob	Because I just stepped on one of these nails.
SpongeBob	The one Phil Preflemuster told us about.
SpongeBob	Even if I let you borrow my huggly snuggly bunny slippers?
SpongeBob	That's better.
SpongeBob	Thank you, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Two.
SpongeBob	Tie.
SpongeBob	Oh, okay, yeah, okay. Here we go. Congratulations, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Come on, Grandpa, you can do it. You still got a good few years left in you.
SpongeBob	Hang on, Squidward. Patrick was just about to figure out where this last piece of the puzzle goes. Weren't you, Patrick?!
SpongeBob	Oh, welcome back, Squidward. We were about to figure out where the first piece of the puzzle goes. Oh, maybe Squidward can help us fig
SpongeBob	What is it?
SpongeBob	Halt! Nobody's to cross this boundary.
SpongeBob	But then again, you may not. Come with me. We shall find out the truth.
SpongeBob	Patrick, look out!
SpongeBob	It's just Patrick gnawing on his can.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, you're a
SpongeBob	That certainly is chum! And such steamy chumminess deserves recompense!
SpongeBob	Oh, that's right, Patrick! The gift shop!
SpongeBob	Surprise!
SpongeBob	OK, OK, I'll tell you.
SpongeBob	All set, Mr. K. 5,000 patties, one for every year Neptune's been alive.
SpongeBob	Oh, I was sure there's somebody.. Oh! Here it is right here. An empty seat.
SpongeBob	Oh no. This is all my fault because I mentioned  Triton.
SpongeBob	Thanks again, Mr. Bus Driver!
SpongeBob	Hey, I was right! It is a tiny toenail clipping.
SpongeBob	Oh, hello, little fella. Maybe you can help me. Because if I don't find Triton soon, Krabs is gonna be real upset, because he spent a lot of money on party decorations.
SpongeBob	Well, he sure seemed upset that you weren't at his birthday party.
SpongeBob	I mean, gods shouldn't have to use nail clippers. They should be able to wear their fingernails to whatever length they want!
SpongeBob	Sorry, I haven't had anything to drink in a couple of days, my throats a little dry.
SpongeBob	Cheap bag of potato choo wait a minute, which way to the nearest phone booth?
SpongeBob	Yeah, I tried for hours and hours but I just can't get it to...
SpongeBob	Wow!
SpongeBob	the Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob	Be very very quiet.
SpongeBob	Yeah, Triple Gooberry Sundays tonight after we free them.
SpongeBob	Quick Patrick, unlock it before he sees us
SpongeBob	Yes Patrick?
SpongeBob	Say again, Squidward?
SpongeBob	So I ran to tell Squidward that he was on TV and he told me that I was on TV and now you're on TV!
SpongeBob	It's heavy!  Thanks! But it itches.
SpongeBob	Today, I feel like doing some dancing!
SpongeBob	Your Krabby Patty, ma'am.  Now eat it, swallow it, and chew it down!
SpongeBob	No, I can't stop dancin' now, Squidward. I have to practice for my big audition tomorrow!
SpongeBob	I am dance-putty in your hands!
SpongeBob	Oh, anything to get rid of these flabby ankles of mine.
SpongeBob	Whoo!!
SpongeBob	Gee, I don't know. Are you sure?
SpongeBob	And a-one, and a-two, and a--  No.  And a-one, and a-two, and a--  No.
SpongeBob	Oh, you're right.
SpongeBob	I was up for that part.
SpongeBob	But I thought he was having a slumber party at my house.
SpongeBob	Pearl? What happened?
SpongeBob	Hang in there, Mr. Krabs. Almost ready.
SpongeBob	Oh, is that it?
SpongeBob	Well, I'm a little stuck, if you know what I mean.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Hello, perfectly made Krabby Patty. Order's up!
SpongeBob	Ohh! Squidward! Squidward!  Are you okay?
SpongeBob	Here, Mr. Krabs. I'll help.
SpongeBob	I can't even eat ice cream now?! This dumb wringer's in the way!
SpongeBob	That's nice, Patrick, but I don't want any cotton candy.
SpongeBob	I have never felt so ashamed.
SpongeBob	Heh, heh, a lot of drama with that one.
SpongeBob	Not fit to live in society...
SpongeBob	Here you go Sandy, a special patty for a special friend.
SpongeBob	Yeah, but something about you is different...I just can't put my finger on it.
SpongeBob	Ahhh, the gooey freshness that is the Krabby Patty patty.
SpongeBob	But I can show you all the other ins and outs of making a steamy Krabby Patty. First, I make sure I'm at the comfortable grilling temperature of 274 degrees.
SpongeBob	You can always count on me, Mr. K.
SpongeBob	Always ensure that your brush is adequately lathered....Always making sure to get both sides...
SpongeBob	Remember, never overdry. Otherwise, the seaweed becomes brittle and cracks.
SpongeBob	Oh, still off by that much. Try it again.  Ooh, try again  Mmm, try again.  Oh, try again.  Oh, try again.
SpongeBob	Mr Krabs! Sandy's makin' off with the formula!
SpongeBob	Huh?  Hey, Squidward, we blew a fuse!
SpongeBob	Sure thing Squidward. One Krabby Patty coming up!
SpongeBob	Order number 17. Order number 17? Order 17? Order 17.
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Uh, uh, scratching!
SpongeBob	No, silly!  That's on the 15th!  Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month.
SpongeBob	Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile.
SpongeBob	Making...Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob	No, Squidward!
SpongeBob	But, sir
SpongeBob	You can't win that award if you don't get up for work!
SpongeBob	I've been better than you 26 months and it'll be 27 tomorrow.
SpongeBob	Well, me neither! 26-time loser!  Look at him. Watchin' me.
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward! Going somewhere?
SpongeBob	Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty!  Ow! Squidward!
SpongeBob	And may the better man win.  He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!
SpongeBob	Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	One double Krabby Patty with everything on it, one order of Kelp Fries, one...  Squidward, what size of kelp fries are these?
SpongeBob	Ooh... what is it?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs. Can I see that? Saw this in a movie once.  mmm... Yeah maybe i wasn't doing it right.  Oh never mind! I was.  Yeah.. Nothing like a long night siphoning grease to put some hair on your chest, Eh? Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Yeah, legal.
SpongeBob	Tell me what, sir?
SpongeBob	It was supposed to be going to table 3.
SpongeBob	PATRICK! Oh no! Not my best friend too!
SpongeBob	No, it's not the end, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	No it wasn't Mr. Krabs! I soaked up all the offending substances from the surrounding area and I'm gonna go dispose of them properly. The Krusty Krab is grease free!  Patrick No!
SpongeBob	Sounds like Mr. Krabs is bragging about me again to his associates.
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward looked taller there for a second. Better get a more accurate measurement.
SpongeBob	You'll care when you find out what's gonna happen to the little guy. WHOA!  Oh, who am I kidding? I need to face the facts.  Face the facts that  the little guy!  And that Mr. Krabs is letting me go today.
SpongeBob	What happened to yours?
SpongeBob	I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I've been a fry cook for so long I... I don't think I can do anything else.
SpongeBob	I can't, Patrick. That's the job I got fired from, remember?
SpongeBob	Wow! What a setup! Oh, I don't know, Patrick. Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe I don't have the talent.
SpongeBob	Oh, well,  is a strong word. I'd like an audition, but if you've already cast it, that's fine if you cast it.  I think she's already cast it. We'd better go, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Okay, getting on it.
SpongeBob	Fantastic.
SpongeBob	That's right. You are looking at a changed sponge. But don't worry. I won't forget all the people who held me on the way up.
SpongeBob	A star's first day is his most important.
SpongeBob	Okay, so, uh, where's my cleaning utensil?
SpongeBob	Well, I'm not.  I am a fry cook.  That's what I am, and that's what I've always been! I'm sorry to waste your time, mister.
SpongeBob	Oh, boy! This is the best job in the world!
SpongeBob	I wanted to study the complete life cycle of a Krabby Patty  tch-tch-tch, all alone. Poor guy.  I could get rid of your trash, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Pretty please?
SpongeBob	Can I help you now?
SpongeBob	C'mon!
SpongeBob	I put it in...
SpongeBob	Your garbage.
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward...
SpongeBob	You sure are!
SpongeBob	Responsible pet owner. I leave Gary alone all by himself all day. I'd better call him just to be sure if he's okay.  Too distraught to even answer the phone.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I'd really love to help, but I've got a lonely pet snail alone at home.
SpongeBob	Mayhap if I get Gary a pal he could play with, he wouldn't be so lonely while I'm at work.
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary's gonna be so happy!
SpongeBob	I've brought you a surprise.  Your very own play pal.  His name is Puffy Fluffy and he'll keep you company while I'm at work. Oh, you two get to know each other I'll be right back.
SpongeBob	Gary, what has gone into you, huh?!  Because you refuse to be cooperate with our new friend and you have ruined my enchiladas dinner, I have but no choice to put you to siesta early tonight.  I hope you're happy now.
SpongeBob	Ahh. I can rest so peacefully, now that Gary's got a good pal they could play with.
SpongeBob	Better go check down stairs and see if my little buddies are getting along!  Huh? What's this? Must have been a sea quake last night. Oh well, what are you gonna do?  That's unusual. WHOA!!  My library!  And my prized memoirs of T.S. Halibut!  My clothes!  This was no random sea quake. Who could have done this? Why, there was one here except...  ...Gary. I bet he's jealous about the new friend.  Gary! You are in big trouble, mister!  Gary, Gary, unlock this door immediately. Gary, Gary, did you hear? Gary? All right Gary, you have let me no choice!
SpongeBob	Fluffy! Fluffy, wait!  Well, Gary, what do you have to say for yourself?
SpongeBob	Psssssst. Patrick, get the Krabby Kiddy Meal. Look,  a regular Krabby Patty here, , a Krabby Kiddy Patty here. 30% cuter. And it only costs one dollar more.
SpongeBob	Sure. You see sharing is the most wonderful...
SpongeBob	Nothing.
SpongeBob	"An officially ""licensed"" Krusty Krab toy? ."
SpongeBob	Oh, hi, Patrick. Have you met my new toy?
SpongeBob	I didn't say that. But I guess we can share Patty Pal.  Now can I see it again Patrick?
SpongeBob	Now is it my turn?
SpongeBob	Goodnight  Poor Patrick. He's only got the Patty Pal for tonight, and he'll be asleep, and won't get to play with it at all!
SpongeBob	Gary, you can be a real negative nancy!
SpongeBob	You don't have any h- come out Patrick! It's my turn!!
SpongeBob	I'm sure!  Hi, Patrick! Time to share!
SpongeBob	Hold on, buster! Hand over the toy! It's my turn!
SpongeBob	How about I take it for half a day?
SpongeBob	Every fifteen minutes?
SpongeBob	Okay then for our final offer we trade off every second!
SpongeBob	Water?!
SpongeBob	It's my turn!
SpongeBob	It's our Krabby Patty toy Mr. Krabs, and Patrick ate it, so I can't play with it.
SpongeBob	Oh you, toy eater!
SpongeBob	Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?
SpongeBob	Rooooooaaaaaddddd... trip!
SpongeBob	Pops?
SpongeBob	Daddy-kins?
SpongeBob	Good luck, Mr. Krabs-
SpongeBob	My quarter!
SpongeBob	You're teaching me to lie?! Lying is wrong, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Blue!
SpongeBob	Uh, Mr. Krabs, you left some bitter tears on the night vent.
SpongeBob	"Well, only if you help me ""exaggerate"" this air conditioner!"
SpongeBob	Oops
SpongeBob	I don't know, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Yes, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Thanks for letting us mow your lawn, Squidward!  Ahhh! My patty flipping hand!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry. But, we don't know what it's like to be ghosts.
SpongeBob	We're going to haunt you! Foreeever!  Oooooohhh!  Well, that killed the mood.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick. I didn't sleep so good last night.
SpongeBob	Can do, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Yeah! Let's go see The Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob	How could anyone live like this?!
SpongeBob	We're still ghosts, because you can't go on your date?
SpongeBob	Yeah... Sizzle those juices.
SpongeBob	Ooh! Do we share our lockers like we share hairnets?
SpongeBob	I promise nothing untoward will happen.
SpongeBob	Too late! it's already done.
SpongeBob	Well, that's simple
SpongeBob	Don't worry buddy!
SpongeBob	Oops! Did I say 10182-E? I meant 20193-F! Sorry!
SpongeBob	Clari-- Oh! You mean this!
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward! You wouldn't believe what I had to go through to get here.
SpongeBob	Look! Here he comes!
SpongeBob	Patrick, look! I caught a rare breed a glowing three-spot.
SpongeBob	Let's just start with the song.
SpongeBob	Isn't it great that these majestic creatures have Jellyfish Fields to call their home?
SpongeBob	I know what a superhighway is! I mean for all this jellyfish! For us! For Jellyfish Fiel--ds, uh, sorry.
SpongeBob	Mermaid Man! Barnacle Boy! Certainly with superpowers like yours, we can stop this superhighway!  Hmmm.
SpongeBob	Well, I guess I'm just upset because they're building a highway over Jellyfish Fields.
SpongeBob	Yeah, why?
SpongeBob	Think this piece will get the point across?
SpongeBob	We're talking about that new superhighway you're planning on building, and in case you didn't know, it's gonna destroy Jellyfish Fields. Not to mention that your plan is stupid and dumb and dumb and stupid.
SpongeBob	What are we gonna do now, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Yes, sir, but with good reason. You see, without Jellyfish Fields, jellyfish will have to find a new home and-
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm scared!
SpongeBob	Wow. Your uncle sounds like a pretty smart guy, Patrick! What happened after he was arrested?
SpongeBob	They left us, out here in the middle of nowhere!
SpongeBob	If we could just come up with a better way to reach the people, something everyone can see and hear!
SpongeBob	Plankton! Driving a big tractor! This doesn't look good at all, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Is that all you got?
SpongeBob	Well, actually, Squidward, it's called a super-highway.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, what are you saying?
SpongeBob	Tell me I'm dreaming!
SpongeBob	Look! All the jellyfish who used to live in Jellyfish Fields are coming to Bikini Bottom!
SpongeBob	Well okay, I guess, sorry I am a little nervous.
SpongeBob	All right everyone, say goodbye to the worst thing that's happened to Bikini Bottom since those 99 cent stores.
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff!
SpongeBob	And Squidward!
SpongeBob	Jelly lelly lelly lelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, everyone sing along!
SpongeBob	Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
SpongeBob	Huh? Who's there?
SpongeBob	Uhh... no.  Is it a true story?
SpongeBob	Do souls look like pickles?
SpongeBob	Well, I'm sick of it.  No more ScaredyPants!
SpongeBob	What do you think?
SpongeBob	Rawr-rawr!
SpongeBob	That is it, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Remember, like this.
SpongeBob	Oooh... I'm the Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob	Who should we scare next?
SpongeBob	Help! Help!
SpongeBob	Pink hat? Oh, that's not a hat. That's my brain.
SpongeBob	This...
SpongeBob	"Those are called ""End Credits,"" Patrick."
SpongeBob	That's a sad song!
SpongeBob	You yelled at me! YOU YELLED AT ME!
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward, there's no way I cry that much. There's not that many tears in my brain.
SpongeBob	Wow, guess I do cry a lot. I promise I won't cry anymore.
SpongeBob	No, I'm still at work.
SpongeBob	Yeah, but I left it in a different spot. Just ask Gary, he knows where it is.
SpongeBob	Sounds fair to me. And if I make it to midnight without crying, you'll come to a slumber party at my place. Just you and me.  Ooh, what's the matter?
SpongeBob	I've never seen such a beautiful underwater sunset.
SpongeBob	Aww. He looks like an angel.
SpongeBob	Mother, father?
SpongeBob	Oh, no.
SpongeBob	You know what they say about that television. Rots the brain.
SpongeBob	You said something, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Yes, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Walking...
SpongeBob	Don't be shy now. I made extra.  That's all right, let it out. You can cry all you want. You're among friends here.
SpongeBob	I've got something for you!  Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff!  Don't forget to read the note!
SpongeBob	So what do you think?
SpongeBob	Eager to get behind the wheel eh? I like it. Repeat after me, this is my register, there are many like it but this one is mine!
SpongeBob	YOU DID! Diligence like this deserves a sticker!  Collect 10 and your entitled to a super sticker!  Why don't we work on our customer service with a little role playing, I'll be the customer and you show me your best and friendliest service, hmm?
SpongeBob	"Psst, Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob, I think it will go smoother if you refer to him as ""duke."""
SpongeBob	YES!
SpongeBob	It must have slipped your mind that you need to submit the order in writing as well. It's the only way to ensure maximum clarity.
SpongeBob	Watch for pedestrians!  Pot hole!  Look out, Mrs. Puff!  Time for evasive action!  And the patty is unscathed! Way to go Mrs. Puff! Your first satisfied customer! Although I have to deduct points for that landing though.
SpongeBob	Didn't you read the note, Mrs. Puff? Here, I taped it together and saved it just in case.  Dear Mrs. Puff, I'm following in your footsteps and got a job as a Driver's Ed teacher for the summer.  SpongeBob.  Now let's open our Driver's Ed handbooks to Chapter 1.
SpongeBob	OK, OK! but I don't how to get into the safe behind the painting in Mr. Krabs' office that houses the secret formula! He won't let me near it!
SpongeBob	No, it's even better! It's the money Mr. Krabs pays  with.  Mr. Krabs' Wacky Bucks!
SpongeBob	Okay!
SpongeBob	No need to remind me, sir. I've broken Rule #2 of the Krusty Krab Rule Book: Never disclose the location of the secret formula! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll fix this.
SpongeBob	Don't worry. Everyone has a secret fear! For instance, Mr. Krabs' secret fear is...
SpongeBob	Well, back to your self-destructive behavior, Plankton. Thank you for this talk!
SpongeBob	Do you know what today is little guy?
SpongeBob	Say good-bye to your friends, Gary! Play time's over! I'll just wip you up some dinner!
SpongeBob	One, two. One, two.  Oh. There you are. That sure is a knock out dinner, ey?
SpongeBob	Gary? Gary?!
SpongeBob	Not now Gary, I'm scolding. And I Suppose... Wh wh what?
SpongeBob	Don't stay out too late, Gary!  They grow up so fast.
SpongeBob	Hello, I'm Squidward. Welcome to the Krusty Krab where we never leave our post.
SpongeBob	Pee.
SpongeBob	Hey! Squidward! You're back from your amazing success as a playwriter!
SpongeBob	Say, is that a copy of your play? Oh, my goodness! Are you going to put on your amazing play in our little old Krusty Krab? Oh, you are a true patron of the arts, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Well, if they eat and watch a play, you can charge twice as much!
SpongeBob	"No. Come on, let's get serious. We need a title that sounds...dramatic! Got it! We'll call it ""Singy Eaty Time!"""
SpongeBob	I don't?
SpongeBob	Oh, the trash is full. I had better call...the garbage truck.
SpongeBob	No, Squidward, no. Those patties aren't fit for public consumption.
SpongeBob	Patrick, wow!
SpongeBob	Sandy!  Oh, its not opening!
SpongeBob	Oh!
SpongeBob	Is your championship title for jellyfishing?
SpongeBob	Rodeo? What does rodeo mean?
SpongeBob	How could we live with ourselves if Sandy got hurt, and we werent there to help? Why, I wouldnt be able to look at myself.
SpongeBob	So there you have it, Mr. Krabs. Sandy really needs our help.
SpongeBob	Uh, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Plankton!
SpongeBob	Ugh. Well, Im going to go save Sandy, whether anyone wants to help or not.
SpongeBob	No, brown. Gary, what does that have to do  You too, huh? Well, well see about that!
SpongeBob	Oh. Yes, Squidward?
SpongeBob	And shesriding a bullfrog?
SpongeBob	No, Patrick. We didnt.
SpongeBob	: Ehh, not really...
SpongeBob	: Ha, ha, ha, ha, don't worry. I've got pictures of that too... but we have a couple more from my early childhood to get through first.
SpongeBob	: So, Grammyma, what kinds of things do you active seniors like to do?
SpongeBob	:  Come on, it'll be fun! Ahhh. Isn't this tea delicious, Grandma?
SpongeBob	: Are you sure? 'Cause you make a real nice scarf. Oh, Great-Grammyma, you win again. All hail the great Grandma, you getting bored?
SpongeBob	:Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ah, she really is shy. Nobody ever uses this door except for me and... ...Squidward!
SpongeBob	: Grammy, there you are. I was starting to worry.
SpongeBob	: Ha, ha, ha... What?
SpongeBob	: Well, there  the safe where Mr. Krabs keeps the Krusty Krab secret formula that Plankton's been trying to steal for the past bunch of years, but I don't think he'd mind if my dear old grammyma rests in there.
SpongeBob	: Grandma?You caught Plankton! Let me guesstrying to steal the secret formula, right?
SpongeBob	Yeah. Watch.
SpongeBob	But the whole process causes Gary big discomfort. I could never do it to him.
SpongeBob	Yes sir!
SpongeBob	I've finished greasing the fryer.
SpongeBob	But aren't they the same size.
SpongeBob	You're gonna' do what sir?
SpongeBob	Okay. Bye old pal.
SpongeBob	Pardon me sir. Have you seen a Crab. walking around with a snail? Have you?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! For shame!
SpongeBob	Oh that's rich!
SpongeBob	Doctor? How does this sort of thing happen?
SpongeBob	Dinnertime, Gary. And it's your favorite flavorcrushed anemone byproducts and krill.  What is that horrific banging?  Patrick's being eaten by a giant sea monster!
SpongeBob	No! Why?! Why?! Why?!  Why?!  It was horrible.  Patrick! Patrick!
SpongeBob	Don't panic. Introduce me first. Then he'll say his name when he meets me.
SpongeBob	Oh, he smashed your house.
SpongeBob	And they built a cute, little fence around Rarrg.  Hi, Squidward, you're home early.
SpongeBob	Your ice cubes, sir.
SpongeBob	Huh?   Good job Gary!  I love you Gary!  Gary Gary Gary Gary Gary!  Ha Ha! Down boy! Ha ha!
SpongeBob	Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?
SpongeBob	I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick.
SpongeBob	You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk...
SpongeBob	Gary.
SpongeBob	Squidward! What are you doing here?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma. I'm squeamish too.
SpongeBob	OW! Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma.
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary, you're better!
SpongeBob	Here ya go. Eat up, Gary.
SpongeBob	'Gary, you're getting a  lot faster!
SpongeBob	Yyyyyy-yyyooooou'll see.That's okay, I'm a lefty anyway!
SpongeBob	Meow! Meow.
SpongeBob	Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow  .
SpongeBob	Hey, where's my alarm clock?
SpongeBob	Hmmm, strange indeed...
SpongeBob	Reporting to duty, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Pearl? what are you doing here?
SpongeBob	...and Gary's shell.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, are you out here?
SpongeBob	Come on, Squidward, stop messing around. We've gotta find Mr. Kra- hey, gumballs! .
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward, Mr. Krabs is gone. I can't take it much longer! Oh, it hurts so bad! I can't take it much longer! I hope he's not in too much pain...where ever he is.
SpongeBob	No.  Patrick, is that a Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob	Yes mermaid ladies, you actually can help us.
SpongeBob	T.N.O.P?
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah!! Wow, sir, that was the single best Krabby Patty I've ever eaten.
SpongeBob	Totally Not Our Problem.
SpongeBob	Isn't that great, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is reclaiming their stuff.
SpongeBob	How sad.
SpongeBob	Old lady? Old lady?
SpongeBob	You're welcome, just take them before someone sees us.
SpongeBob	Ohh please, Mr. Krabs don't fire me. Pleaaaseee!
SpongeBob	What about the curse?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, what makes you so sure that even if we find that old lady, that she will lift the curse?
SpongeBob	Well, this must be it. The lair of the Golden Eel.
SpongeBob	It's the eel. Well, nappy time always comes after pudding. Let's go get the doubloon from his throat before he wakes up.
SpongeBob	...Hide behind...  WOAAAH!!!!
SpongeBob	We're not finished yet!  I got it! I got it! I got it! I got it!  I don't got it.
SpongeBob	Say! Who wants...the first patty from our freshly cleaned grill?!
SpongeBob	Now all I need is a fresh patty.
SpongeBob	Ah-ha!  Oh, this is easy. All I have to do is pull the drain plug.  Pull the drain plug. Pull the drain plug. Pull the drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug.
SpongeBob	Where is the Main Drain, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Who's been at Bikini Bottom for as long as Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Yeah, but Mr. Krabs said-
SpongeBob	Does the Main Drain even exist?
SpongeBob	Isn't your curiosity piqued? What if somebody accidentally pulls it? What if- What if-
SpongeBob	Let's start walkin'
SpongeBob	Well, that's out.
SpongeBob	Doin' great Patrick! We'll be there in no time!
SpongeBob	NOOO!!!! We came to see if it was real!
SpongeBob	Pheeeww. That was a close one...
SpongeBob	I cherish my fellow residents...
SpongeBob	Boy, Squidward, looks like you need your plumbing checked.
SpongeBob	What's the matter, Squidward. Don't you have an attitude of gratitude?
SpongeBob	Sorry to interupt your crying, Mr. Krabs, but shouldn't we get to a place that at least doesn't have a roof with lava coming through it?  Fear not, shelter can be found--
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward, who do you think is the most miserable person?
SpongeBob	You never forget, boss man.
SpongeBob	Was it pustule?
SpongeBob	I believe we were at turmeric.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I'll do it. Send me to retrieve that formula.
SpongeBob	Oh, thank you Mr.--
SpongeBob	Wow, a real-life butler.
SpongeBob	Oh, oh yes, of course! How silly of me.
SpongeBob	Well, then follow me to the dining car.
SpongeBob	Hi again, kind butler.
SpongeBob	Huh, friendly lady. Well, Patrick, we'd better find a safe place to store this for the night.
SpongeBob	Oh yeah? Well no offense, but I don't believe you.
SpongeBob	As you know, an unspeakable crime has been committed here today and each of you have the means to do it. The question is who? You there, you're not fooling me with that innocent act.  Where were you at 6:42pm on the night of January 16? And don't give me that goo-goo-ga-ga stuff.
SpongeBob	Sir, if you search this baby's diaper, you'll find the stolen key.
SpongeBob	If they didn't do it...that means the key was stolen by...the butler.
SpongeBob	I don't believe either of you. Shake 'em down.
SpongeBob	Well, that is great news.
SpongeBob	Fresh water.
SpongeBob	Patrick, hop up on my back.
SpongeBob	Alright, Plankton, end of the line!  Plankton!
SpongeBob	Patrick, we have to stop this thing! Go see if you can do something with that stuff. I'll try and get the door open.
SpongeBob	Oh, uh, yes, sir. I copy. I'm SpongeBob and I'm on an out-of-control train.
SpongeBob	Oh, the back of the train is gone!
SpongeBob	'Attaboy, Patrick. Don't give...
SpongeBob	I simply refused to fail, sir.
SpongeBob	Oh, we're not playing in  yard, Squidward, we're playing in  yards. We're just using your yard as a walkway.
SpongeBob	Patrick!  The road!  Patrick! What are we gonna do?
SpongeBob	SquarePants residence.
SpongeBob	Tag! You're it!
SpongeBob	You're it!
SpongeBob	Do like the roots do, and do the Dirt Dance Davey!
SpongeBob	Yeah! We're reprobates!
SpongeBob	Not it!
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward
SpongeBob	Ahhhh.  Good Morning Squidward! Another Beautiful Day under Bikini Bottom!
SpongeBob	Ahhh. Patrick, Thank you so much! If it weren't for your tremendous gorilla strength, I would've been a goner! If there's anything I can do to return the favor, anything at all... you just let me know. Anyway, back to my Karate exercises.  Oh, and help yourself to the cheese bucket. Thanks again buddy. HIYA!
SpongeBob	Yeah... However...
SpongeBob	"Okay. Lets start off simple. This is a basic move called ""the inverted whirlpool""."
SpongeBob	Patrick, I didn't want to have to say this... but you're... you're unteachable.
SpongeBob	Now let's put your new skills to the test. This is sharpened, tempered steel. Now don't be frustrated if it takes a few tri- . Wow. Amazing!
SpongeBob	Noooooo! What did I tell you?!
SpongeBob	Hey, look, it's Patrick!
SpongeBob	Patrick, don't you think you're taking your perfect slice too far?
SpongeBob	Mad chopper! Patrick!
SpongeBob	Patrick, what are you doing?
SpongeBob	Just stop chopping, okay, Patrick?
SpongeBob	You must resist!  AHHHHHAAHH!
SpongeBob	Oh, hi, Patrick. What did I miss?
SpongeBob	Hey, great job, Patrick! I like the unnatural details.
SpongeBob	Trash? Oh, but, Mr. Krabs, this should be in a museum for future generations to enjoy.
SpongeBob	What a beautiful lamp, ma'am, so ornate, essential for night time reading.
SpongeBob	A four-striped sock! Incredible!
SpongeBob	After you then!
SpongeBob	He shoots, he scores!
SpongeBob	Hmm. What should we do for the next 50 years?
SpongeBob	Yes, yes, now where did we leave off?
SpongeBob	Hmmm.
SpongeBob	Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?
SpongeBob	Good morning, Squidward! See you at work!
SpongeBob	We're playing flashlight tag.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, we should do something very special for him, then he won't feel sad anymore!
SpongeBob	That's a great idea!
SpongeBob	Sorry we couldn't make it last, Squidward
SpongeBob	Ready to go?
SpongeBob	Now?
SpongeBob	Now?
SpongeBob	Now?
SpongeBob	Ready?
SpongeBob	Does this mean you wanna go...
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Patrick. But, we'll still be on the first bus to Glove World!!
SpongeBob	Gosh, Sandy, I'd like to but I'll miss the first bus to Glove World!.
SpongeBob	Um. Pearl? About those shoes? No.
SpongeBob	Oh, sure.
SpongeBob	Hey, what's this?  Don't throw out that old too soft sponge, toughen it with a new abrasive side!  Say! Gary did you order this for me?
SpongeBob	See ya, Gary!
SpongeBob	I've got an abrasive side, now!
SpongeBob	Oh, sure thing Mr...
SpongeBob	Well, Patrick, are you ready to have some fun?
SpongeBob	Yes Patrick, help me get this abrasive side off my back! You'll help me, won't you, buddy?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	And now, it's taken over!
SpongeBob	Well I just couldn't say...
SpongeBob	Phew. Thank you, Sandy! You too, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Doo Doo Doo-doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo! Doo-doo Doo Doo Doo-doo doo-doo! Trying to stop it is futile. So just listen now to my Musical Doodle! Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo doo...
SpongeBob	Sorry. It's just so catchy.
SpongeBob	Yes... No! That this song and I were meant to be together.
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary!  Just the pal I'm looking for. Want to hear my new record?  I knew you would!
SpongeBob	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo...
SpongeBob	Every time it plays, it's an electric charge!  The sound in your head is brutal. Now you're infected by the Musical Doodle.  Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo.  You're gonna listen again to the Musical Doodle!
SpongeBob	Keep your trap shut! It wasn't my trap!  One more outburst like that and Mr. Krabs will send you home for the day! Okay! Okay! But I feel it building up inside of me!
SpongeBob	Doo doo doo-doo! The Musical Doodle!
SpongeBob	Hi, Patrick!
SpongeBob	You wanna play hide-and-seek?
SpongeBob	C'mon, Patrick, Quit fooling around! We've played hide-and-seek dozens of times!
SpongeBob	Gosh what?
SpongeBob	Hide 'n seek!
SpongeBob	You think you're getting it now, Patrick? Did you find the sock puppet demonstration to be useful?
SpongeBob	Why can't you?
SpongeBob	That's perfect! Now I'm gonna run and hide.
SpongeBob	Right. Here I go.  One, two, three, four, five, six,seven, eight...
SpongeBob	SQUIDWAAARRRD!
SpongeBob	OK. See ya, bye.
SpongeBob	Don't worry Mr. Krabs, I'll clean it up.
SpongeBob	Thanks Mr. Krabs! Darn it!
SpongeBob	Because we're playing hide and seek. Wanna play?
SpongeBob	Are you sure you're sure you're sure you're sure?
SpongeBob	Looking for Patrick. I've been seeking and seeking all day but I can't find him.
SpongeBob	Yes. Yes absolutely.  Thanks again Sandy
SpongeBob	Exactly.
SpongeBob	I can't believe it! Patrick it really is you.
SpongeBob	Yeah
SpongeBob	Patrick! You were under there the whole time?
SpongeBob	Ask away.
SpongeBob	Say, Mr. Krabs, can I give Gary a Krabby Patty for tomorrow? Because tomorrow is a special day!
SpongeBob	We're all out of Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob	You sold it, remember?
SpongeBob	Wow, a fresh batch of Krabby Patties! Gary's gonna go crazy!
SpongeBob	Oh, there you are Gar bear I got you some kelp fries.  I was going to bring you a Krabby Patty, but we ran out! So, you enjoy them while I get your bath ready.  Gary! Your bath is ready! Gary?  Gary?  Gary, not again come on out it's dirty!  Gotcha! Come on Gary, quit messing ar....
SpongeBob	Gary! I'm going to start the bath!
SpongeBob	"Ah-ha there you are Gar-Bear!  Oh, you naughty little snail hiding from me! I'm gonna give you a real good scrubbing. You have to be sparkly clean for ""Bring your pet to work day""! And today is the day!   First I'm gonna start you off with a yummy smelling shower gel!"
SpongeBob	Doesn't that feel good?
SpongeBob	We gotta get you to the pet hospital!
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary!
SpongeBob	Doctor, you don't mean...  Doctor?! Oh well, Gary, this looks like it might be...... the end.
SpongeBob	Don't you worry, Gary, I'll whip you up the best Krabby Patty you've ever eaten.
SpongeBob	Wow, Mr. Krabs, Gary's doing a great job as bouncer. He's really earning his pay!
SpongeBob	(gasps) You don't mean...
SpongeBob	(looks behind the counter) No need to shout Mr. Krabs, he's right here, secretly watching his favorite soap, 'As The Tide Turns'.
SpongeBob	Oh, and check this outa special spy pen! Looks just like a regular pen, right? See? See? See? See? See? See? Just a pen, right? See?
SpongeBob	I am inside. I repeat, I am inside. Nothing of interest to report so far. In fact, it's kind of dumpy. And customer safety... a little lax. (customer sits on a chair but it collapses) And it smells in here like a tuna bathed in algae after running a marathon.
SpongeBob	"(reads policy) ""Headbands equal no service."" Barnacles! My disguises' only weakness-- (two employees grab SpongeBob and take him away) Whoa! Mayday, Big Red. Contact has not been established. Mission abort. Mission abort! (employees throw SpongeBob out) Yellow Scrubber to Big Red, I was not able to obtain any intel."
SpongeBob	I see a huge statue depicting Mr. Sea Chicken and all his glory! (a bunch of kids are climbing on the giant statue)
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Anything for the artiste.
SpongeBob	Reporting for duty, sir!
SpongeBob	I think you look really good, sir. You're golden! (laughs)
SpongeBob	Not to worry! I am a sponge after all!  Hold still, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Oh, what do we do?
SpongeBob	Gary can be a little bit creepy.
SpongeBob	Use your words, Patrick!  Squid... Squi... Squi... Squi...!
SpongeBob	Eeh, BubbleBottom!
SpongeBob	I can't let you do that, Patrick! I'll be the one to delay my life!
SpongeBob	Oh, I know what to do! After all, I've had the suds! I just have to absorb the whelks' snot, and they'll return to normal!
SpongeBob	Patrick and I are practicing our favorite noises. Mine is a dolphin, laughing.
SpongeBob	Well, let's take a look.  We've done everything in this issue. Oh, except for this one! The Best Friend Quiz! Do you really know your best friend? Oh, this should be easy. Patrick and I know everything about each other!
SpongeBob	No, no, no, no, no. After you, bestest friend-  -Oof!
SpongeBob	Simple, Patrick! It's because you're my best friend!
SpongeBob	...an innie!
SpongeBob	Question 2: Is your best friend left-handed or right-handed?
SpongeBob	Sorry, Patrick. I have an outie.
SpongeBob	Okay, let's try an easy one. Is your best friend a boy or a girl?
SpongeBob	What shape is your best friend, SpongeBob SQUAREPANTS?
SpongeBob	Time's up!
SpongeBob	"Bye Pearl! Tell Mr. Krabs I said ""Hi,"" Let's bounce Patrick. Patrick?"
SpongeBob	Uhm, Pearl. Your arm... it's outside the boat.
SpongeBob	You're supposed to remain seated until the ride comes to a COMPLEEE-
SpongeBob	Okay, then. I'll just fearlessly lead the way... SNAKES!!!
SpongeBob	...And I won't talk about ZOMBIES!
SpongeBob	Or bus drivers!
SpongeBob	Oh he's here.
SpongeBob	Aww. The Hall of Great Romance!
SpongeBob	What's that?
SpongeBob	Ooh...delicious!!
SpongeBob	I made it with leftover ingredients.
SpongeBob	I can't read it from here, Mr. Krabs! What's it say?
SpongeBob	Wow, Mr. Krabs! We sure are gettin' a lot of orders for Krusty Dogs!
SpongeBob	Changes...?
SpongeBob	No more Krabby paddy
SpongeBob	I was asleep?
SpongeBob	Aye aye, captain.
SpongeBob	Really?! What was it?
SpongeBob	Eh, I was kinda wondering could we just go back to selling Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob	Here you go, hungry customers, your delicious Krusty Dogs!
SpongeBob	Yea! You know what gives them that added flavor?
SpongeBob	Hurray!
SpongeBob	QUIET GRANNY! I'M TALKING!
SpongeBob	We need stronger tactics.
SpongeBob	Your Krusty Dog sir, with extra mustard.
SpongeBob	Have a nice day!
SpongeBob	Aye aye, captain!
SpongeBob	"I know! What if both of us are ""it?"""
SpongeBob	Whoa, what is this place?
SpongeBob	Wow, what's this?  Mauna Loa.  Oh, I'm late! Gotta get to work!
SpongeBob	Whew, that was a close one!
SpongeBob	Sure thing.  Arr! Oh, looks like the work day's over. See you tomorrow, sir!
SpongeBob	Doesn't that make the secret hideout a little less secrety?
SpongeBob	I'm not aware of any treasure. But I suppose since you're such a nice boss, you can hang out at the hideout. Just as long as you keep it a secret.
SpongeBob	Ahoy, Mr. Krabs! Maybe they hid the loot off ship in that shed!
SpongeBob	Captain's Quarters. There must be some treasure here, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	It's gone, Patrick. Our secret paradise is gone forever!
SpongeBob	Well, Patrick, I guess we really lost our secret hideout this time.
SpongeBob	Hi-yah! Oh, sorry, pineapple house. I thought you were someone else.  Ah, what a great day at work.  Huh? Yeah...  I know you're back there, Sandy! And I also know that nobody can hide from Sponge...  ...Bob.  I got you now! Hi-yah!  Well, I guess the coast is clear.
SpongeBob	Hi-yah!  Uhh, just a second.  Safety first!  And now, spin technique!
SpongeBob	Hey Sandy, have you ever heard the one about the squirrel and the tin cans?
SpongeBob	Yah.
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Thought you could sneak up on me at work, did ya? Well, you can't! Cause I'm fast, I'm mean, and I can do this!  Ssss!  Took care of her, yes I did.  Oh, ahoy, sir!
SpongeBob	Aye aye, capi-tay. Nice hairpiece, Squidward.
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	No, no. Really, Sandy. Stop.
SpongeBob	But I uhh, she...
SpongeBob	We can? I mean, sure we can. Yeah! Like we can, uhh.  We can squeeze things!  Woo! How much fun was that?
SpongeBob	I feel dumb just thinking about it.  Duuuuh! I'm stuuuupiiid! I like karaaateee! Doyeee!
SpongeBob	For a second that sounded like.
SpongeBob	How many slices of barnacle loaf do you want?
SpongeBob	Hmm?
SpongeBob	Uhh, sure.
SpongeBob	Right!
SpongeBob	And I'll cut the cheese!
SpongeBob	In your dreams! Hi-yah!
SpongeBob	Hit it one more time Patrick. Don't want anyone stealing it.  Perfect
SpongeBob	No, Patrick here is just gonna rent out his front yard.
SpongeBob	Aww, why not?
SpongeBob	Do you know what that means?
SpongeBob	Yeah, besides, we have more pressing things to attend tolike this jellyfish we've befriended and this brand new bottle of bubbles!
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward!  You've dropped your ook!
SpongeBob	Then why don't you ask her out on one of those dates you keep talking about?
SpongeBob	Oh no shes not! Hang on buddy!
SpongeBob	Wait a minute! Before you make any hasty decisions, allow me to tell you a few things about my friend Squidward. Things I think you should know, like that Squidward is by far the single most intelligent person I know.
SpongeBob	Not to mention that he's an incredible painer, a virtuoso musician, loves to cook and clean and also enjoys gardening quite a bit, too.
SpongeBob	I mean, when was the last time you went out on a date?
SpongeBob	Just one minute, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Oh, you're so sweet! Where are my flowers?
SpongeBob	To dinner, silly.
SpongeBob	Ah, snug.
SpongeBob	Great, I know a fabulous place! Just head this way.
SpongeBob	At this street here make a right. At this intersection make a right, and park at the orange building up ahead. Ooh! We're here!
SpongeBob	Good start, but let's try something interesting. Maybe she would want to talk about her day for example, she might want to being up her promotion for a job at work, her experiences with a pet snail, or how she just couldn't decide what to wear!
SpongeBob	Why, thank you, sir!
SpongeBob	Um, Squidward..
SpongeBob	Have fun you two, oh SquarePants your work here is done.
SpongeBob	Wow, I didn't know you had a sister!
SpongeBob	Yeah, Patrick and I go back a long way.  Yeah long way, heh heh, go back.
SpongeBob	Easy now gents, let's not let tempers flare. Now don't you think, Patrick, it's a teensie bit unfair that sister Sam dismantled Squidward's house?
SpongeBob	I don't think you should do that.
SpongeBob	Well Squidward at least on the bright side it will motivate you to finally take care of that kitchen remodeled. Right Squidward?  Huh? Must be eager to get started.
SpongeBob	She destroyed my house in a fit of rage! She needs to control her temper!
SpongeBob	Nu uh uh! Lab Partner!
SpongeBob	We did it!
SpongeBob	Here's your teleporter, lab partner.
SpongeBob	Test monkey,  Test monkey reporting for duty!
SpongeBob	"Clear of what? ""Something weird is going on around here"
SpongeBob	Oh no! Plankton has finally won! And we, we helped him.
SpongeBob	He's in the storage room. Says he's working on something requiring...  ...complete privacy.
SpongeBob	Oh, sure.
SpongeBob	Hmm? Huh? If I'm gonna solve this problem, I'm gonna need an assistant.  Ok, when you take a bun, I'm gonna hit you with the shelf.  Looks like we'll have to do it again.
SpongeBob	He didn't call him Mr. Krabs, we did. We some help with the investigation. Right Patrick?
SpongeBob	Can't you two make up and be friends.
SpongeBob	The Flabby Patty?
SpongeBob	Whoa, whoa, whoa now. Instead of competing, why don't you cooperate and steal the recipe together.
SpongeBob	Yeah, pie.
SpongeBob	Hello? I--I have an announcement to make!
SpongeBob	Not to worry gentlemen. I have a plan.  Oh, yeah, perfect.
SpongeBob	The Flabby Patty is hiring. If you can get the job, the recipe is yours.
SpongeBob	So, what flavor is it?
SpongeBob	Careful now...
SpongeBob	I got this new microphone system which everybody hears them, The sign with a menu on it, and a colorful arrow from the Krusty Krab. It even lights up, see?
SpongeBob	I'll have that ready for two shakes in a lamprey's tail! hehehehehe!  Oops.  There we go, good as new.  Thank you, come again.
SpongeBob	Sure thing Larry!  Gehh! Gehh!
SpongeBob	Because I can't reach the window of Larry the Lobster's sub!
SpongeBob	I'm on it! .
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! We got to do something! The customers are mad with hunger! They're beginning to riot!
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff, thank you most of all!
SpongeBob	Gasp! It's Tony Fast! The famous race boat driver!  And his first born son Tony Fast Jr!
SpongeBob	"What does ""Incorrigible"" mean?"
SpongeBob	JUST DRIVING!  W-w-w-what do these dotted lines mean!?
SpongeBob	LET GO?!?
SpongeBob	I can see that! And I'm eager to learn more from you!
SpongeBob	Oh! I'll be delighted to!
SpongeBob	Nice place you got here Tony Jr!
SpongeBob	Wow! They're so shiny!
SpongeBob	A spin? But we don't even have boating licenses!
SpongeBob	Hah... my nerves! I almost forgot about... MY NERVES!  Sorry sir!
SpongeBob	Eh... if you say so!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!
SpongeBob	Thank you! And may I say how lovely your speed boat is, too! For a bunch of circles! And by circles, I mean well-rounded individuals! Ah ha ha ha!
SpongeBob	I don't hear anything...
SpongeBob	Grrr!
SpongeBob	Now there's a helicopter after us!
SpongeBob	How should I know!? He's YOUR dad!
SpongeBob	Oh! Oh! Oh! Never argue and drive?
SpongeBob	I guess we were just too upset about the rain and how...
SpongeBob	Let's get this game teed off.  You're up first, my good man.
SpongeBob	What are you doing?
SpongeBob	I think you're missing the point.
SpongeBob	All right. You wanna play competitive, eh? Observe.  Right between the old wickets. Come on bally, don't fail me now.
SpongeBob	Oh, where did our balls go?
SpongeBob	Hey! Patrick. Patrick! What's the big idea? I thought we were in here to play golf, remember?
SpongeBob	M-hmm.
SpongeBob	I have to play the ball where it lies.  You'll need to leave this open.  Now, let's see, if I was a golf ball, where would I-oh! Next to the gallbladder, of course. Fore!  Where's your ball?
SpongeBob	I could do that blindfolded.
SpongeBob	Patrick! This is ridic-  -ulous. Wow. Squidward's really let this place go. Patrick!
SpongeBob	Those balls have gotta be around here somewhere. Oh, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Okay, you're good to go.
SpongeBob	Good morning.
SpongeBob	Spring cleaning! Guess what time of year it is, Gary?
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob	You're right. I'm going to need something to preserve the memory.
SpongeBob	Oh, that's not all! And I'm also very sentimental about these Krusty Krab keepsakes, so many memories! Grill grease, gum from under the Krusty Krab tables, today's mop water, bendy straws, mayonnaise, a collection of freshly used ketchup packets, and these are today's order tickets written by my favorite fellow employee, Squidward. See? This one has your tentacle print on it!
SpongeBob	Oh, nonsense, Gary, I'll find a place to put everything.
SpongeBob	How do I know it's you?
SpongeBob	Ah, not the sanitation police! You don't understand, these things aren't junk! They're my friends, like this little guy,  Alfred the light bulb. Oh, we had great time together, Al, reading, paying the bills. Why is it the ones who glow brightest burn out the soonest?!  You will be missed.
SpongeBob	Vacate? You mean I have to move?
SpongeBob	Throw them away?
SpongeBob	That's a great idea, Squidward! Then years from now, I can look at the photos, and remember my... remember my precious little babies!
SpongeBob	Alright, nighty-night.
SpongeBob	Hooray, land squirrel!  Look out!  Hold on, little squirrel!  You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai!  Hey, I'm actually doing it.  Your shell is mine!
SpongeBob	Oh. Oh yeah? Watch this!
SpongeBob	Me too! I love air! Air is good.
SpongeBob	I just met this girl! She wears a hat full of... air!
SpongeBob	Like that?
SpongeBob	Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy!  Sandy, somethings gone terribly wrong. There's no water in...  ...here.
SpongeBob	I brought you some flowers.
SpongeBob	Water would be nice.
SpongeBob	I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I NEED IT!
SpongeBob	I tried to tell you!
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary.  You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary.  Hey! Over here!  Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license!  Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it!  I sure take a good picture.  Darn! I should have grown a mustache.  How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt.  Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here.  Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!
SpongeBob	Gary?
SpongeBob	Who?
SpongeBob	I wonder what Patrick's dreaming.  I can't resist!  Hey Patrick!
SpongeBob	Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream.
SpongeBob	Trust me, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Hey! I'm at Sandy's!  Aw, this looks neat! I wonder...
SpongeBob	Okay!
SpongeBob	Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.
SpongeBob	Whatcha doin Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	This one?
SpongeBob	Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	This'll make a great fish story, eh Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Plankton!
SpongeBob	Gary!  I've got you, Gary!
SpongeBob	What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no!
SpongeBob	Uh, Patrick, those don't move.
SpongeBob	"Squidward! Free!  He doesn't look so ""hot."" We better take him with us."
SpongeBob	Hi, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Hey! How about a campfire song?
SpongeBob	I thought that was just a myth.
SpongeBob	Hm? Oh! Ew.
SpongeBob	Hold on tight!
SpongeBob	Huh?  Plankton?  Poor guy, the ice is really getting to him.
SpongeBob	Pursue? Formula? We've gotta find Mr. Krabs right now!
SpongeBob	We made it! Right, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Gasp! Gary!  Oh, you poor fella! We put you too hard to[???]Sorry, I won't make you[???]another inch.
SpongeBob	No we're not Mr. Krabs.  Your chariot awaits!
SpongeBob	Hooray! We made it.
SpongeBob	Here we go again...
SpongeBob	She loves your jellybeans Patrick!
SpongeBob	Good morning, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Wow! Doesn't get any better than that!
SpongeBob	Oh!? Maybe Squidward can come down and teach us how to play it! That will be real fun won't it Patrick?  AHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhh...  It just not the same without Patrick playing along too.  Alright Patrick, you leave me no choice.
SpongeBob	Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
SpongeBob	Is that a yes?
SpongeBob	So um, what do you guys think? Sweet duds huh Patrick?
SpongeBob	Please be gentle!  Heh, that's weird I thought I was gonna get tossed out on my...  AHHHHHHHHH!
SpongeBob	No please!
SpongeBob	There's once, was a man, from Nantucket.  Sorry, wrong one! AHEM! Dear friend, don't say that over! As long as I breathe, I will cherish our bond!
SpongeBob	Patrick! It's not a beard! It's a sea urchin! It must've been sleeping on your face until your tears woke it from its hibernation.
SpongeBob	Sorry, Squidward, I got a little distracted.  I'm practicing for my oral report for Boating School tomorrow.
SpongeBob	I never knew an audience can get so physical.  This changes everything.
SpongeBob	Okay, here goes.  Boating safety is...
SpongeBob	Patrick, you're kinda derailing the proceedings here. Just focus on me, huh?
SpongeBob	Worse?
SpongeBob	Boating safe...
SpongeBob	Okay.  Boating safe...
SpongeBob	Patrick, stop! Somehow your help just isn't helping. I am more nervous about this oral report than I've ever been about anything.
SpongeBob	That's still illegal. Give me the goggles!  It's not working.
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah! Of course I'm ready!  I can do it.  Um...  Oh, no. Oh, no!
SpongeBob	Thanks!
SpongeBob	I don't know how!
SpongeBob	Hey, I did! Thanks, pal!
SpongeBob	Hey, that happened to Patrick once, too! He
SpongeBob	Well, let's see. If you really want to impress Squidward, try talking to him about music.
SpongeBob	Whoo! I wanna play!
SpongeBob	Boy, that was a close one, huh, Squidward? He almost got your clarinet.
SpongeBob	We're making arts and crafts. I've been learning the fine art of basket weaving.  I made this one using designs of me and my best friends.  And I also made this cute little scallop house.
SpongeBob	Hey, don't be sad. You can be an artist too. I'll find something that will tap into your particular artistic skill set.  Now let me see. Oh, this'll be perfect! Now, start with a rock...
SpongeBob	And presto: A rock with googly eyes!
SpongeBob	Oh, sorry.
SpongeBob	We both are. It's lots of fun! Would you like to make something, too?
SpongeBob	Squidward, I think we should have a little talk about your gambling problem.
SpongeBob	Oh, Patrick, that's terrible..
SpongeBob	Here's your Krabby Patty!  Shall I put it on your tab?
SpongeBob	Here's a whole new batch of Krabby Patty canvases.
SpongeBob	Yes, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Um, Patrick, the slides.
SpongeBob	Sorry.
SpongeBob	Yes, he'd like a vacation.
SpongeBob	Yay!
SpongeBob	Whoa!  Oooh, a letter! Thank you, Mr. Mailman!
SpongeBob	Oh, Mr. Krabs, this says you and a guest!
SpongeBob	Go Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	A good fry cook is never far from his grill, sir.
SpongeBob	To see her vacation slides for the hu..  Ow!
SpongeBob	Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I activated it! How was I to know it was hooked up to your doorbell?
SpongeBob	I'll be right back!
SpongeBob	"I need a bon voyage sheet cake.  Could you put yummy words on it? Hmmmmm, what would those yummy words be? I got it! ""Have fun on the moon..."". What rhymes with ""moon""? Tune? Roon? Noon? Goon?"
SpongeBob	I went to get you a, so I went to the, and then I got you a, and then T-minus something, and
SpongeBob	Oh, I brought you a bon voyage sheet cake.
SpongeBob	Oops. Sorry Sandy.
SpongeBob	Ok.
SpongeBob	I don't know what corn is, but I sure like cans. Alright, I'll give it a try.  Sandy, this doesn't seem right.
SpongeBob	Watch this Sandy!  Alright. A no-look... let's see... a one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up  puncture into the side of the rocket.
SpongeBob	Is that bad?
SpongeBob	My goodness!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs was right, He's taken on to Vacation, What did I do Wrong?
SpongeBob	Going on vacation with Mr. Krabs! Going on vacation with his daughter Pearl! Going on vacation with the whole Krabs clan! La la la la la la! I'm a vaaacation man!  Hey travel buddies!
SpongeBob	Um, is time to come up yet?
SpongeBob	Bathroom! Bathroom!
SpongeBob	Yeah, I...  ...sure did sir!
SpongeBob	Anytime sir! Oh! The tour's leaving without us!
SpongeBob	Phew... that was close.
SpongeBob	Yay!
SpongeBob	Wow! It's-
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary, I don't feel like myself.
SpongeBob	I can't get the suds,  because then I'd have to miss work!
SpongeBob	Right away, sir.
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary, I feel horrible.  Oh, who am I kidding, Gary? I've got the suds, no doubt about it.  I'd better take care of this before it gets out of hand.
SpongeBob	I'm sick, Patrick. I'm going to the doctor.
SpongeBob	Is that the horrible part, Patrick?
SpongeBob	You gotta help me get better, Patrick. Please? Would you like to be my doctor, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Sure! At this rate, I'll be cured in no time. In fact, I'm going to call Sandy and tell her not to come. Thanks, Dr. Patrick!
SpongeBob	Not really.
SpongeBob	Nope.
SpongeBob	Ahh...
SpongeBob	Guys!
SpongeBob	You're not going to make me read old magazines, are you?
SpongeBob	Wow, look at that cloud.  It looks just like Sandy.
SpongeBob	What is it, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Hurry up, lazy-bones!
SpongeBob	Okay, I'll be right there!
SpongeBob	I do, Mr. dead pirate, sir!
SpongeBob	We do! We do!
SpongeBob	Uh, uh, us?
SpongeBob	One scoop, please.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, it was awful! We just had a spooky encounter of the ghostly kind!
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs! We don't know the first thing about ghost hunting!
SpongeBob	Look, Mr. Krabs! The doubloons!
SpongeBob	Aah. That hits the spot!
SpongeBob	Hey, that's funny! Hmm, this chest says it belongs to the Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob	Order up, Squidward! Everybody hold onto something! It's time to flip the patties! Hit it!
SpongeBob	Check. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures?  Check. Drapes?
SpongeBob	And...
SpongeBob	Hey, thanks for letting us in, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Hang on a minute, Patrick, we've got Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy standing right over here!
SpongeBob	Yeah, Mermaid Man, what about Barnacle Boy?
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, the overcooked popcorn will be ready in twelve minutes!
SpongeBob	Pushing what?
SpongeBob	Hi Plankton!
SpongeBob	Well, I guess Plankton's right. Good thing I always bring backup milk!
SpongeBob	OK, buh-bye!
SpongeBob	This isn't an invasion, we're here to show you how much we appreciate all the good deeds you've done lately. We came to give you the great big hug!
SpongeBob	Affirmative, captain!
SpongeBob	I will do you this favor, sir chum, never fear!
SpongeBob	I took him to see a hypnotist.
SpongeBob	He was a really good hypnotist.
SpongeBob	I don't think this is going to work.  This ol' shovel is gonna do the work!
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	Hmm... Water and... this soap?
SpongeBob	No, I think one jar of concealing cream is enough. Don't worry, Pearl, no one will notice a thing.
SpongeBob	Okay, I'm coming in!  Look at the bright side, Pearl. At least you can still play the piano.
SpongeBob	Okay. Where do you keep your soap?
SpongeBob	Soap press?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Pearl. I said I'm not going to let Mr. Krabs down, and I'm not going to. What do you think of that?
SpongeBob	All set! Close your eyes and get ready to sparkle! One, two, three.  Ta-da! What do you think?
SpongeBob	You have a good time, carefree teens!
SpongeBob	Oh, boy, the mail's here!  What do we have today?  Gas bill... taxes... letter to SpongeBob from  Gramma!
SpongeBob	My daddy is going away. Can you take care of me...eow?
SpongeBob	Patrick!  Patrick?
SpongeBob	Ineed you to take care of Gary.
SpongeBob	Ok, Patrick. There you are!
SpongeBob	I'm gonna miss you, little guy. But I know you are going to be in good hands.
SpongeBob	Oh, Gramma, you shouldn't have. It's your birthday, I should be serving you!
SpongeBob	Thank you.
SpongeBob	Yeah, Patrick, about Gary's bath, make sure the bath water is not too hot, and he doesn't like too many bubbles.
SpongeBob	Happy Birthday dear old Gramma, Gramma, Gramma! The best Gramma in the world, Gramma, Gramma!
SpongeBob	It's SpongeBob. Is Gary all right?
SpongeBob	"Hang on, Gary!  Gary!  What's the matter, buddy?  Ahhh... reading Patrick a bedtime story, I see. ""Snail Tales,"" that's a good one."
SpongeBob	Gary, what has gotten into you? Is there something important that you'd like to tell me?  Aaaaaah!! Today is Sunday?! But that means...
SpongeBob	Nnnnope.
SpongeBob	Yeah, right.
SpongeBob	But you have to promise not to touch anything.
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, I insist. From now on, you must stick to me as closely as possible. Do I make myself perfectly clear?Patrick, I said, do I make myself perf... Patrick! Patrick?
SpongeBob	And
SpongeBob	Patrick how many times do I have to---
SpongeBob	(cries until Sandy came back) (gasps) Sa..S...S..San....Sandy? (Sandy walks in shocked by the destruction) How was the inventors convention?
SpongeBob	No, with a fishbowl on my head.
SpongeBob	Silly old robot. He doesn't realize you have more than one of these ray guns. Isn't that right Sandy? You do have more than one them? Don't you Sandy?(Sandy doesn't answer)Sandy? (gulps)
SpongeBob	Oh! Kelpy G is performing tonight, Squidward. But tickets are  sorry, sold out.
SpongeBob	You're probably not gonna get that back before show time.
SpongeBob	Can you believe it? We're gonna meet your hero, Kelpy G!
SpongeBob	Whoa, just look at that lemonade line.
SpongeBob	Oh! Why don't I get one for you?
SpongeBob	Look what I found!
SpongeBob	Are you friends with Squidward?
SpongeBob	Patrick, what brought you here?
SpongeBob	Oh! Oh!
SpongeBob	Neato.  Watch this.
SpongeBob	You want more?
SpongeBob	Maybe even smarter.
SpongeBob	Phew! Thank goodness. Allow me to get the door.
SpongeBob	Make sure and hold her tight, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Uh-oh.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, Sandy's run out of that crazy air stuff that she needs to breathe. We have to find some right now or she'll be headed for the last roundup.
SpongeBob	Okay, I'm ready.
SpongeBob	No, Pearl. Don't go. You're a mammal, right?
SpongeBob	Okay, hold still. This may pinch a little  Okay, Pearl let 'er rip.  Now just keep breathing, Pearl. Come with me, Patrick. I have an idea that'll fix everything.  I'm gonna go up to the surface to get some air.  When I tug on this rope, you pull me down.
SpongeBob	Okay, SpongeBob, it's time to catch a breath for Sandy.  So fresh it hurts.  Okay, Patrick, pull me down.
SpongeBob	Oh, you could say we had a little help from a big bubble.
SpongeBob	You know kah-ra-tay?
SpongeBob	Okay? How do I do that?
SpongeBob	But how can anyone ever truly know whether he or she is worthy?
SpongeBob	In turn I will!
SpongeBob	Thanks Gary!
SpongeBob	Okay Sandy!  Prepare for my finishing move! I call it The Sleeper!
SpongeBob	Squidward I...I failed my karate exam...
SpongeBob	Okay! There you go Sandy!
SpongeBob	Okay, looking good!
SpongeBob	Sensei Fuzzy! You okay?
SpongeBob	Well, I'm bubbles for you, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	And I have a present for you!
SpongeBob	Not yet.
SpongeBob	Hmmm...nope, sorry.
SpongeBob	It's not the carnival.
SpongeBob	Now take that quarter and buy some cotton candy...
SpongeBob	You'll have to guess!
SpongeBob	Nope.
SpongeBob	If Patrick doesn't get his valentine...
SpongeBob	No, no, B, Sandy! No, B!  Uh, Patrick, you know how sometimes you plan something special and things don't just work out?
SpongeBob	A friendly handshake. Happy Valentine's Day!
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	I'm telling you, it's right there, turn around!
SpongeBob	Patrick, no!
SpongeBob	La la la la la la la! This is going to be great, Shiny! Downsy Daffodil. Squidward loves meeting new friends.
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward. This place is so filled with sharp, jagged, broken things! This is no place for a little bubble boy!  There he is! Don't worry, Squidward. I'll get him!  Nope. Jagged glass. Barbed wire. Cactuses. Cactuses protected by barbed wire. Shh! Shiny must be in this one. Gotcha!  No, guess not.  You don't think he p-p-popped in there?
SpongeBob	Shiny, no!
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squidward. Shiny's made of soap. We'll just wash it off.  There you go, good as new.  Really catches your inner self. Oh, look at the time. Time to go to work! See you there. Bye!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, allow me to introduce you to Shiny Bubble.
SpongeBob	Wow, I think Mr. Krabs really likes you. You play with these while I tend to the grill.  You sure are lucky, Shiny. You get to learn the glories of the service industry.
SpongeBob	"That's okay, Shiny. It's too dangerous for you to work at the Krusty Krab, anyway. But, there are some fun, safe things we can do. Like stand in place, or sit in place. Or the ""let's do nothing at all"" game. Patrick is really good at that one. He-"
SpongeBob	Oh, tartar sauce. Shiny, no!
SpongeBob	"Shiny?  ""Pitchfork Pantry."" Of course.  Aah. Ow.  Shiny, how many times do I have to tell you? No sharp, no pointy! Now, let's see if there's a safe place for you to visit. Ah! ""The Pillow Foundry"" That's a safe place to visit. Pillows aren't dangerous.  Huh?"
SpongeBob	Shiny! Don't worry! I'll save you!  Oh, that ain't right!  Oh, come on, man!  Phew, that was close.
SpongeBob	Again?
SpongeBob	Oh! Hey, Squidward. What are you doing?
SpongeBob	Can I walk with you?
SpongeBob	Wow, Squidward, how do you know that?
SpongeBob	Squidward, can you hear me? How many fingers am I...  Squidward?
SpongeBob	Wow Squidward! My very own... restraining order. Uh...what is that?
SpongeBob	NO! I DON'T WANNA GO!
SpongeBob	Think SpongeBob think! Gasp! I got it!
SpongeBob	Squidward, please don't send me to jail!
SpongeBob	I'm not?
SpongeBob	Well, cause you're the mascot.
SpongeBob	I just want to help him find the perfect Krabby Patty gimmic.
SpongeBob	Uhh, I can explain. That partially eaten Krabby Patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art. It's worth a fortune.
SpongeBob	No, you need to turn yourself in.
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Patrick, what are you eating?
SpongeBob	My pleasure, sir. And I think Patrick likes it too.
SpongeBob	What's so... why, it's my happy book. The Krusty Krab is where all of my happiest memories occurred.
SpongeBob	How can you live without a happiest memory? Do you cry yourself to sleep at night?
SpongeBob	No problem.
SpongeBob	See? Your happiest memory is forming!
SpongeBob	Wow! Your work at a museum Squidward!
SpongeBob	What a majestic view!
SpongeBob	Hey! We're the first to ever reach the top of Mt. Bikini! Surely that makes for a happiest memory! I claim this mountain in the name of Squidward Tentacles!
SpongeBob	Squidward sure seems depressed. I think I'll call him to cheer him up!  Hello? Squidward? Are you there?  Squidward? Are you there? Squidward?
SpongeBob	Thanks Gary! I have to find a way to give Squidward a happiest memory. These pants may be square, but it's time to think outside the box!
SpongeBob	Sigh... he's so handsome!
SpongeBob	Aw. You're the charms. If only you didn't sting, you'd make the perfect pet!  Oh, well! I guess it's catch and release for now.
SpongeBob	Wow, Patrick! That's a great idea.
SpongeBob	Um, that's some good advice. Good night, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Woah! Look at all of the customers!
SpongeBob	Say, that's a pretty neat trick! I'm going to get some extra mayonnaise from the back.
SpongeBob	Oh, that's okay. I-I have one at home. Hah...
SpongeBob	What are we going to do, Sandy?
SpongeBob	There's lot at the Krusty Krab! But we'll never get past THEM!
SpongeBob	Good one Jellien Sandy.
SpongeBob	D'oh! Almost forgot!
SpongeBob	Well, let me tell ya!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, if you want to get customers in here, shouldn't we lower the prices?
SpongeBob	It's the only way, Mr. Krabs.  Alright, sir, it's time.
SpongeBob	It's for your own good, Eugene. Free Krabby Patties, come and get your free Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob	Here let me help you, Squidward
SpongeBob	You mean, different.  That's it!
SpongeBob	It's working!
SpongeBob	Hear what?
SpongeBob	Oh! Sorry, Gary. You want to eat, huh? Don't worry, I can fix both problems.
SpongeBob	You're just in time to lend a hand, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Holding steady Patrick. But, who knows how long this support system will last?
SpongeBob	Not now, Patrick. And Squidward has done a great job holding it up.
SpongeBob	Uuummmmmm... excuse me, everyone? Not to micromanage or anything, but do any of you actually know how to build a pineapple?!
SpongeBob	Sandy, my furniture is perfectly fine.
SpongeBob	Gary, do you ever feel like you are not being listened to?
SpongeBob	Oh, no, Gary! I still haven't fed you. Let's take care of that right now, little bud-
SpongeBob	It's, uh...
SpongeBob	Gary, I don't think that was the sink.
SpongeBob	Well, Gary. There's only one thing left to do:  call and have this place condemned.  Hello, operator. City hall, please, Office of Broken Dreams.
SpongeBob	Good night, sir.  See ya tomorrow.
SpongeBob	Judging from our location, I'd say Plankton.
SpongeBob	Must be the dial-up thingy
SpongeBob	All right!
SpongeBob	Well, we could rebuild Karen 2.
SpongeBob	Perfection.
SpongeBob	Yes, I had a cup of sea kelp and a neptune muffin.
SpongeBob	Oh, but sir, I can't miss work at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	I just don't get it Gary, I don't usually have a problem sleeping, do I?
SpongeBob	What to do?
SpongeBob	Boy, It sure is quiet around here. Only 5 hours until I go to work. 4 hours 59 minutes, 4 hours 59 minutes 51 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 41 seconds!  What if I don't get to sleep at all?  Ohhh, Mr. Krabs was right!  I am an insomniac. What am I gonna do? (speaking) I need some help.  Patrick, Patrick, wake up.
SpongeBob	Ah, Yay!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep.
SpongeBob	That's a catchy bit...
SpongeBob	Oh, barnacles.
SpongeBob	BLECH!
SpongeBob	C-C-C-Coffee? Oh, for the last time, Patrick, I'm trying to GO TO SLEEP!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry warm milk, you just tasted so good.  Shoo! That billboard is definitely NOT talking to you.
SpongeBob	It's getting all sleepish around here.  Thank you Sir Cecil. Hmm? Hey, looks like I finally got some sleep. Now to prepare for work.  For work.  Bye Gary.
SpongeBob	All employees must wash their hands.
SpongeBob	Is that a good thing?
SpongeBob	That's awesome!
SpongeBob	I'm glad Mr. Krabs caught us before it was too late. Let's agree never to make faces again.
SpongeBob	Hey!  Patrick. Patrick!
SpongeBob	Aw!
SpongeBob	Duh!
SpongeBob	I can't breathe! Well, still no frozen faces. Let's really put this myth to the test. Let's see what happens when me hold one face for a long time.
SpongeBob	: It never gets so old!
SpongeBob	Hey! That's a good one right there.
SpongeBob	I can't move my face either!
SpongeBob	: And you're a licensed mussoge, right Sandy?
SpongeBob	: You hear that, someone just dropped a penny.
SpongeBob	:  Onion juice! Ah!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs is still distracted, now's my chance. Your order is served, sir.
SpongeBob	How should I know, I'm just a cook in these parts.
SpongeBob	- Wait Squidward, don't get worked up you could get the Face Freeze!
SpongeBob	You dropped this little piece of paper.
SpongeBob	So you don't want it?
SpongeBob	So are you definitely, positively sure?
SpongeBob	So, I take that as a possible no? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?  Okay, Squidward, that's a promise I'll just have to keep. Ah, Mr. Paper, I am so lucky to have a friend like Squidward.
SpongeBob	Well, yes, Gary, I am a sponge with paper stuck in his pants, but I'm also...  Super Sponge, soaking up crime. See, here's my cape.
SpongeBob	You're right Gary. I'm not a jungle boy. I'm a box of army supplies.  Bringing relief to the hungry troops!  Landing just in time for the bullfight!  Toro, toro, Gary! Toro, toro! Toro, Gary, toro...  Hey, ole! Now for some impressions. A guy with a mustache.  Look at me, I'm a guy with a mustache. A pirate with an eye patch.  Arrgh, I'm a pirate. A regular guy with an eye patch.  Arrgh, I am not a pirate.
SpongeBob	Oh, that's a good one, Squidward, now let me try.  Have you heard any good jokes, Mr. Paper?
SpongeBob	Nope.
SpongeBob	I can't!
SpongeBob	Wanna see it again?
SpongeBob	The rubber band? Do I dare?
SpongeBob	Hey, listen...
SpongeBob	Ah! Guests! May I offer you some lemonade?
SpongeBob	I'm sorry I gotta go.
SpongeBob	Patrick wait!
SpongeBob	Ooh, that looks Glovey on you Patrick.
SpongeBob	All's fair in glove and war.
SpongeBob	Well, there she is Patrick. It's time to say goodbye to the Tilt-A-Hurl.
SpongeBob	The Glove Boat. My most favorite ride in entire glove kingdom. This is the last time we'll ever ride it.
SpongeBob	No not that it was... oh no Patrick look!
SpongeBob	We have to jump off this thing before it crashes! Come on!
SpongeBob	Look!  Whoa, right in the middle of Glove Lake.
SpongeBob	See what I mean Patrick. Glove world! is on it's last legs.
SpongeBob	Of course, we just have to fix Glove World!.
SpongeBob	Hall of mirrors.
SpongeBob	Boy, the swing ride is really slowing down. Bet something I can fix.
SpongeBob	Listen Patrick, did you hear that?
SpongeBob	Glove Universe grand opening! Are you ready Patrick?!
SpongeBob	So where you keeping it?
SpongeBob	Well, uh...
SpongeBob	No. The worst part is missing a glorious shift here at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Squidward, what could it be?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	I'm so sorry, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Oh this. It's a number 2: Krabby Patty with cheese, medium drink...
SpongeBob	Hello, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Mis...ter...Krabs.
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs, you have to believe me. Squidward's got a horrible disease called Squid's Disease! Scratchy throat, itchy eyes, dry mouth, fevers, and boils, and missed workdays!
SpongeBob	Everything's fine, captain. Just a little howl for pleasure.
SpongeBob	Sorry, I think I might be coming down with something.
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward.
SpongeBob	I figured I can't make you well, Squidward, but I can at least make you comfortable. I brought hot compresses, tissues, the good kind with snail butter, and even a romantic comedy for us to watch. I know they're supposed to funny, but they always make me cry.
SpongeBob	Squidward, Squidward wait. Squidward, you're not well enough to return to work. I can't let you.
SpongeBob	Squid's Disease? I know just the cure!
SpongeBob	Yeah. It's a good thing too. One more crash and you would've popped for sure. Here, let me take that wheel.
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff! What are you doing!?
SpongeBob	Hello Mrs. Puff. Are we feeling any better?
SpongeBob	Come on Mrs. Puff! You need to get out of this stuffy, old room!
SpongeBob	What's so funny?
SpongeBob	Ah!
SpongeBob	Put her in drive? Thanks Mrs. Puff, You're the best!
SpongeBob	Hi Squidward! What'cha watchin'?
SpongeBob	Don't change the channel!
SpongeBob	Snail Bites.
SpongeBob	We'll have some more of these a little later.
SpongeBob	Gary, that's an awful lot of Snail Bites for one evening. Are you sure you want more?  Well, I suppose one more couldn't hurt.  Whoops, looks like that was the last of them Gary. We're all out.  It's probably for the best. [sleepy, he rubs his eye] I'm getting pretty tired anyway. I think I'll skip my nightly motivational exercise and go to straight to bed.
SpongeBob	Hold on. There's something on the lid. You missed a bun seed, Mr. Krabs. Plankton was right.
SpongeBob	Puppets!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	One Krabby Patty to go.   Here you are.
SpongeBob	That's my Krabs.
SpongeBob	Okay...
SpongeBob	Ohh... Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me! Fa la la la la la la la la lee! And who is that I see? Underneath her Christmas tree?
SpongeBob	Don't you mean the season of
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Don't mind if I do!
SpongeBob	Hello, fellow revelers! Would you like a Christmas treat?
SpongeBob	Great to see people so passionate about the holidays.
SpongeBob	Hi, Santa! Have some fruitcake.
SpongeBob	Gee. That wasn't very nice.  Seasons greetings, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Ah, Christmas Eve! When all of Bikini Bottom is filled with good will.
SpongeBob	Good idea, Squidward. I'll have to thank you when you get home.
SpongeBob	Oh, the problem isn't the fruitcake! The problem is that everyone, including you, is acting like a jerk! Oh, I'll have to solve this on my own.  Whoa!
SpongeBob	Uh-huh.
SpongeBob	Hmm That's not aformula! That's a song!  Sandy! The song is the antidote!
SpongeBob	Santa brought nearly every gift on your list. Why whine about the one that he missed? Don't be a jerk, it's Christmas! It's Christmas! Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas!
SpongeBob	Oh, no!
SpongeBob	But- but- but- but- but- but---!  But, Santa, you've got it all !
SpongeBob	You put that jolly elf down, you big tin imposter! Hot from the oven, full of lovin'! Hurry up, Santa, hop on!
SpongeBob	Going to work, going to work, I'm going to work! I'm going to work, I'm going to work  I'm going to work!  I'm going to work. I'm going to work, going to work, go-going to work. I'm crossing the street!  I'm crossing the street! Cross- whup! I'd recognize that sound anywhere! It's the sound of horrible, croaking sobbing!
SpongeBob	Oops, uh... I mean, I fancy a bit of the old chum. Indeed I do, Squire.
SpongeBob	: A what?
SpongeBob	I haven't seen Mr. Krabs all morning. Do you know where he is?
SpongeBob	Uuuummmmm, hmm. Um, no, no, no, possibly, no, maybe, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no! No, sir, I do not recognize any of them, sir.
SpongeBob	Hello, Bottomites!  Hello, sir! Have you ever heard of the most wonderful restaurant in all of Bikini Bottom, the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	Patrick! What are you doing? It's me, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob	It's a flyer... to promote the Krusty Krab! Cause Mr. Krabs needs all the money!
SpongeBob	Don't forget about the paint!
SpongeBob	Uh, Patrick, what are we doing here?
SpongeBob	Phew!
SpongeBob	Hello? Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Hey, uh, Patrick?  We're not supposed to play in traffic.
SpongeBob	Thank you, Patrick!  That should do it! Let's go back to the Krusty Krab and greet that last 1%!
SpongeBob	Sir yes Sir!
SpongeBob	I'm just here if you would sign this petition. It'll save the Krusty Krab from getting bulldozed!
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Mr. Delivery Man. I got this.
SpongeBob	This must be Plankton's dirty plan.  Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Plankton, I'm sorry.  Sorry I made my Krabby Patty so delicious.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs is hurt so much!
SpongeBob	Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Thank you, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  Oh, dear.
SpongeBob	"There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: ""The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt""."
SpongeBob	I already took care of it.
SpongeBob	"You are a real pirate. Go straight to the ""X"" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure Mr. Krabs!"
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.  See you tomorrow.  Huh? Who's there?
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs...
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! I wanna go to bed! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?
SpongeBob	Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches.
SpongeBob	Really? Can we see the map?
SpongeBob	The whole ship is underwater captain.
SpongeBob	Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew.
SpongeBob	I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!
SpongeBob	Patrick, what are you doing?
SpongeBob	Yeah?
SpongeBob	"Look! It's the ""X""."
SpongeBob	What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?
SpongeBob	And one for all.
SpongeBob	And one for all.

SpongeBob	Oh the crowd went wild sir!
SpongeBob	Wait! Squidward! Squidward! You can't go! Please! Don't you see? The Krusty Krab needs us more than ever!
SpongeBob	Squidward...you must look inward. And then I'm sure that you will see what an awesome band we still could be! Please! Oh please don't quit on us now! I cannot allow this to be our last bow!

SpongeBob	Explosive, huh? I know just the thing!  Boom!  Impressed?
SpongeBob	Brutal.
SpongeBob	Wow!
SpongeBob	What's this? Someone threw away a book. You shouldn't throw away books.  Ooh, Sandy, you're a trash monster?
SpongeBob	Hold tight, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Yeah, you could say that. You have to eat as much chum as you can.
SpongeBob	Oh yeah? Well, Charlie Mackeral, the current record holder did.

SpongeBob	Um, hurray!
SpongeBob	First thing's first, Patrick. What do you like to do?
SpongeBob	That is so exciting! I can't wait to tell Gary, my parents, grandpar- [
SpongeBob	What're you doing out there?
SpongeBob	The Dirty Bubble?!
SpongeBob	Way to go, buddy! You're a hero! Uh, may I have your autograph?
SpongeBob	That snailsure is acting weird. It's like he's teething again.Hey, hold on a second...Gary, have you been chewing on my bowl?!
SpongeBob	What are you doing here? You don't have a pet.
SpongeBob	A pet toy that plays with your pet! What do you think, Gary?
SpongeBob	Here, you might need this. You know, I'm not sure that toy is safe for Gary. Where is Gary, anyway? Gary?
SpongeBob	You want it, boy?
SpongeBob	I know what will get Gary's attention. Good old Slimycan!Here you go, Ga-Darn it, Gary.
SpongeBob	Oh, so you've hidden it?Oh no you don't, come here! I bet I know where it is.Hairball. Hairball. Wallet. Darn it, I thought I lost this  and I just cancelled my credit cards! Hairball. Toothbrush. Aha!I knew it!You'll see. Some time apart will do you good.There we go, out of sight, out of mind. I know you're upset now but wait until tomorrow morning.Why, you probably won't even remember that old ball.
SpongeBob	Gary! I mean, oh hey. What are you doing here, waiting for a bus?Oh, Gary, does this mean you've come to love me more than that chew toy?
SpongeBob	A license to milkshake? Well of course I do silly!  And it doesn't expire until......SEVEN YEARS AGO!?
SpongeBob	Mmmm!

SpongeBob	I'll show you! I'll show you all I can make a milkshake!
SpongeBob	NO Captain Frostymug! I can do it! Let me show you! I just know I can!
SpongeBob	Don't worry sir! I'm coming!  Gotcha Captain!
SpongeBob	One milkshake, coming right up!
SpongeBob	Aw huh. I found a box of my old baby toys in the attic, and we're playing with them.  Hey! I found my old teddy walrus! This really brings me back.
SpongeBob	What's the prognosis doctor?
SpongeBob	You like that Squidie?
SpongeBob	There, there now nothing to cry about.
SpongeBob	But...
SpongeBob	Squidward! That's not for eating!  There we go. Good as newww!  That's not for eating either!  Sorry, sir.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, watch his head!
SpongeBob	Sorry!

SpongeBob	Squid!
SpongeBob	Sea urchin! Geh...
SpongeBob	Squidward! Don't let it in the dining room! You're our last line of defense!

SpongeBob	Well, I guess this is far enough. Here you go little fellas! This will be your new home!  Run! Be free!  Uh oh...
SpongeBob	How much is it?
SpongeBob	What did you say?
SpongeBob	I see you!
SpongeBob	Where did you see that?
SpongeBob	Rock Bottom.  It sure is weird around here. Kinda different, even the soil looks different.
SpongeBob	I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right. Don't run for a bus.  Especially one that's going up at a 90-degree angle.  I better go wait for the next one.  C'mon, bus. I've got to get home and feed Gary.  Uh-oh, shoe's untied.  Over, under, and over, and loop-dee-loop, and over...  and through the hole.  My balloon!  Wait! Hold on! Stop that bus. Aww, not again!  Umm, excuse me, sir. Can you help me?  Uhh, uhh, yeah, I...  No, no! Not the balloon! I need to know what time the next bus comes...  Well, there goes another one. I gotta be more diligent. I am not leaving this spot, no matter what.  I'm gettin' hungry.  Glove candy dispenser. Good thing I went to Glove World!.  Eww, glove flavored! Hey, what's that?  A candy machine. Mmm, kelp nougat crunch.  I'm not leaving this spot, no matter what!  I'll only be gone a second.  Hey!  Ooh!!  Come on, come on!  Hey, that was mine!  Barnacles! Alright, that's it. No more mister nice guy.  Tartar sauce!!  Fish paste!  I'm getting to the bottom of this, right now! I want a bus to Bikini Bottom. I am first in line and no one is going to tell me, otherwise!  Ok, second. I am second in line.  Ok, third is good.  Fourth, not bad.  Ok, 329. I am 329th in line and nobody forget it.
SpongeBob	The bus schedule. The next bus.
SpongeBob	Hold it, I'm not through here!  Do you hear me?  I demand you come back and give me a bus to Bikini Bottom, right now. And until then I am not leaving this spot.  Ok, like I said, I'll be right here when you get back. At this spot. In the dark. By myself. With no one around. Except my glove light!  Ah, that's better.
SpongeBob	Ah, home at last.
SpongeBob	Hiyah!Sorry, Squidward!I thought you were one of those creepy creepers. You know, Squidward, you really should know how to protect yourself. Maybe you'd like to join us.
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	Um, Squidward? It's just Gary.
SpongeBob	"Eh, don't you mean ""karate?"""
SpongeBob	Play close attention and you will receive the totality of my karate mastery! Handed down from Sensei Cheeks herself. Now watch! Watch and learn.
SpongeBob	Whoa!

SpongeBob	Psst! You missed a spot!
SpongeBob	Sandy! I found him! He's over here! You forgot your belt silly!
SpongeBob	Psst! Hey, Sheldon!
SpongeBob	Hi Karen! Look Plankton! Karen came to visit and she brought you a cake!
SpongeBob	Oh. Well, enjoy!
SpongeBob	Plankton is breaking out of jail tonight! And he's coming to the Krusty Krab with a bunch of criminals to steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula!What do we do?
SpongeBob	Is it Toxic Patty Tuesday?
SpongeBob	Got it. Two drops... ]
SpongeBob	No pulse.  We're losing him! Hang in there, buddy!
SpongeBob	Oh hi, Plankton!  What brings you the Harvey's Spatula Emporium?
SpongeBob	Wow! I must know more.
SpongeBob	Hey, that rhymes. Almost.
SpongeBob	Well, nothing me and the SizzleMaster can't handle.
SpongeBob	I wasn't talking to my spatula!
SpongeBob	Hey! That's a great idea! But you man the condiments, I'll take the grill. Sorry, but I don't trust anyone with this baby, but me.
SpongeBob	Don't thank me, Mr. Krabs.  Thank my new magic talking spatula.
SpongeBob	Yes?
SpongeBob	Here she is. Home sweet pineapple.
SpongeBob	Mmm, mmm.
SpongeBob	Uh, eh...
SpongeBob	Oh, no!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I think your blinker's broken.
SpongeBob	The whole enchilada.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	And it's really stretchy. It's some kind of goo bubble.
SpongeBob	It's so gooey.
SpongeBob	Why not try a goo bubble?
SpongeBob	Wow, it's so big!
SpongeBob	Uh, I have a better idea.  Hold out your hands.
SpongeBob	Now what do we do?
SpongeBob	Uh, Sandy, why do you have missiles in your sub?
SpongeBob	Yeah, good thing.
SpongeBob	No, but you're close. What we need is  liquid soap. It's time to fight bubble with bubble!
SpongeBob	Here goes.  Geroni-blow!  Pretty slick, huh? Get him!
SpongeBob	See, Patrick? Bubbles are the answer to everything!
SpongeBob	I can't take it anymore! I'm gonna go look for him!  Hold on, Krabs! I'm coming for ya!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	I know!
SpongeBob	Oh, that's nice.
SpongeBob	Coast is clear! What's the plan, buddy?
SpongeBob	I wish we had something stronger. But this'll have to do.
SpongeBob	Patrick, you ready?
SpongeBob	That you can't put a price on freedom?
SpongeBob	Squidward, you are looking at two very grown up big boys.
SpongeBob	The Fisherman's got him!
SpongeBob	Come on, Patrick, we've got to get home!
SpongeBob	I think it's coming from over there.
SpongeBob	Yeah, thanks, Squidward. I don't thinkwe would've evergotten home with you.
SpongeBob	Now who's here?
SpongeBob	Quick. Block the door.
SpongeBob	I guess this is the end, old buddy.
SpongeBob	Just leave it to me, old rusty one! Prepare for a... What the barnacles is a Rusty on Rye?  Let's see... R... R... R... Ramblin Ham, Red Herring, Rib Tickler, Rusty Penguin, Salty Steamer. Huh, guess I don't know how to make Rusty on Rye.  But I can certainly learn! Help me out, sir. Can you clue me in on what was on your beloved Rusty on Rye?
SpongeBob	I believe I've seen a program on this matter!
SpongeBob	Ahh, simple, my five-pointed friend. Tonight, we shall make contact with the unliving!  By performing... a sance!
SpongeBob	Rusty's Rib Eye!
SpongeBob	Ahh, well that was... just gibberish. Hmm.. I got it! How bout you write down the recipe for the classic #9?
SpongeBob	A rye sandwich carved entirely out of driftwood? Mama mia!
SpongeBob	Oh, okay.  Hmm... smells industrial! Ugh! Um.. I'm sure it's an acquired taste.
SpongeBob	Alright guys, I hate to be a party pooper, but it's a little late for all this noise.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! Patrick! Help!
SpongeBob	And everything was better!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I was merely emulating my latest media obsession...   Kenny the Cat
SpongeBob	But what about the Kenny the Cat blimp which hovers over Kenny the Cat Sports Stadium?
SpongeBob	Yeah! And he's visiting Bikini Bottom tomorrow with hundreds of his rabidly, loyal fans.
SpongeBob	Hey, Sandy, you're kindalike a cat, aren't you?
SpongeBob	"Very well, Sandra. If that is your stance, then so be it. Could ""someone"" be jealous of Kenny's dazzling lung capacity?"
SpongeBob	You know, I read in  that he's so used to holding his breath that when he's topside, he forgets to breathe.
SpongeBob	Yeah, Kenny's awesome. Hey, that reminds me!  Let's paint our faces to look like Kenny!  Perfect!  We're the biggest Kenny the Cat fans ever!
SpongeBob	Well, I guess it's plain to see who the true Kenny the Cat fan is.  10:00! Kenny Time!
SpongeBob	Mr. the Cat? Everything OK?Say, Mr. Krabs, this is gonna be a long day for Kenny. How about we give him a minute to freshen up?
SpongeBob	How could you, Kenny?! You broke my heart! Here I was this entire time believing your act,only to discover thatit was nothing but... an act!
SpongeBob	All right, Kenny, all right. I promise I won't tell anyone.
SpongeBob	Uh, we needn't burden ourselves with such needless scientific technicalities, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Dust specs on the window! Don't worry, boss man, I got it covered!  That's better! Oh, sounds like the dishes are done soaking!
SpongeBob	Done and dusted!
SpongeBob	Responsible for what, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Squidward and I are as close as brothers!
SpongeBob	If the Yeti Krab catches wind of it, he's gonna...  you know,  eat us!
SpongeBob	Good day, sir. Are you  to order?  Oh, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Oh, boy! I'll have to work twice as hard to make up for Squidward's laziness!  A wobbly table! Oh, we can't have that!  Come on. No.  There! Perfect!  Yikes! Time to top off the mustard!  See I'm busy! I'm organizing the spice racks! By color!  Well, I guess while I'm down here, I'll hit the old grease traps again.  I'm not lazy! Don't eat me!  I'm sorry, Mr. Yeti Krab!
SpongeBob	Shh! Squidward, he might hear you! Don't worry, Mr. Yeti Krab! We have plenty to do!  I can replenish the toilet paper!  And redecorate Mr. Krabs' office!  And refold the napkins into origami figures!  Knit straw cozies!  Clean the soap!  Re-clean the grill!  Washing inside the walls!  Sucking up every dust particle in the restaurant!
SpongeBob	T-T-T-T-T-T-Two Yeti Krabs!
SpongeBob	Done!
SpongeBob	Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahh, what a beautiful day!  I wonder if Patrick's at home.
SpongeBob	Texas? What's a Texas?
SpongeBob	Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy.  Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah!
SpongeBob	Look Sandy, we caught one!
SpongeBob	Sandy...
SpongeBob	Sandy?
SpongeBob	Wait, Patrick, listen. It's Sandy.
SpongeBob	Everything looks perfect. We're going to get Sandy now.
SpongeBob	What are you doing with those bags?
SpongeBob	But, Sandy, don't you want to say good-bye to all your friends down at the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	Oh, so you mean we can't say anything bad about...  Texas!
SpongeBob	The stars at night are dull and dim, whenever they have to be over dumb ol' stupid Texas!  Hey, Patrick, what am I now?
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, that's enough.
SpongeBob	Sandy, no!
SpongeBob	...homemade peas-in-a-can pie...  ...and we got our very own 10 gallon hats!  So, what do ya think? Are you gonna stay?
SpongeBob	That makes me feel all wiggly.
SpongeBob	Oh, Mr.-  what?
SpongeBob	But--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but.
SpongeBob	Hey, Gary, I'm home.
SpongeBob	That's how I used to hold my spatula.  Patrick, what's wrong?
SpongeBob	F-f-f-f-f-f-f...
SpongeBob	It's not food, Patrick. I got fired.
SpongeBob	Uh...  Hey, Squidward. Look at me. I'm fun-employed!
SpongeBob	Yippee.
SpongeBob	You're right, Sandy.  I'm afraid I can't do this anymore, Patrick. Unemployment may be fun for you, but I need to get a job.
SpongeBob	Hmm.  This grill is not in very good shape.
SpongeBob	They're weenie patties.
SpongeBob	Well that was a setback.  Hello, Pizza Piehole!
SpongeBob	Cool.  Well, it's no Krabby Patty, but... Perhaps I'll find contentment.
SpongeBob	But who'll make the Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob	But I've given you the best years of my life, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	For years I worked at the Krusty Krab. Now I've been fired five times in one day.  Who are you gonna cook for now, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob	What's that, Gary? It's the best food you've ever had?
SpongeBob	But you just fired me.
SpongeBob	Pizza sauce?  I'm free!
SpongeBob	Whoa!
SpongeBob	Yes, Squidward?
SpongeBob	All right! Now my life has purpose again!  Let's get this place cleaned up.
SpongeBob	Thanks for waiting, Squidward.
SpongeBob	I know, only fifteen minutes early? Maybe we should take a shortcut!  Squidward, what are you doing?!
SpongeBob	Mmm, strawberry!
SpongeBob	Squidward, I am going to find that shortcut!
SpongeBob	Local landmarks...  A-ha!  Right at this large and unusual shell.  Right at this abandoned sofa, and jog left at the broken fire hydrant.  There it is, the Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob	Oh, you should try it! It's the best place to eat in all of Bikini Bottom!  Here, take this coupons!
SpongeBob	It's me, Squidward. SpongeBob. I'm calling from the payphone.
SpongeBob	Uh, hold on!  Two nickels! I need a dime! Oh, I'm never going to get to work!
SpongeBob	Isn't it a little early to be hitting the high-fructose corn-syrup?
SpongeBob	Thanks a lot, Scott! Stay in school!  Krusty Klam?!  Wait, Scott, come back!  TARTER SAUCE!!!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Oh, I've been in driving school as long as I can remember, and I still don't have my license!
SpongeBob	Uh, are you sure about this, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Okay!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, you're so wise.
SpongeBob	Oh, I'll say.
SpongeBob	I'm doing it, Mr. Krabs! I'm driving the boat! Uh-oh.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. The fire in my belly has gone... ]
SpongeBob	Snapping!
SpongeBob	Uh, I thought you were just using Gary as a colorful example, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Officer, I don't have the boating handbook with me, but...
SpongeBob	Hey!
SpongeBob	Squidward, I'm no mathematologist, but that sounds like a lot!
SpongeBob	Oh! Who's the lucky...
SpongeBob	Come on, jump rope. I guess it's just you and me.
SpongeBob	I'll be your friend.
SpongeBob	You don't have to ask me three times.
SpongeBob	Just playing draggy rope. You wanna play?
SpongeBob	Anything for a friend.
SpongeBob	: Hey, I heard youre in charge of the laundry room on Thursdays. Thats nice.
SpongeBob	: Uh-huh! An executive treatment!
SpongeBob	Like what, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Maybe Pete is just tired.
SpongeBob	Hey! Maybe Pete's boss could have a company picnic and Pete could have a great time and relax and come back and work twice as hard!
SpongeBob	Pace yourself Squidward, the fun is just getting started.
SpongeBob	Is this far enough?
SpongeBob	Well, Mr. Krabs, it is a company picnic.
SpongeBob	A real disk?
SpongeBob	Hey, Plankton. What are Simmy and Tally up too?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs is right, Plankton. We're having lots of fun. Come on, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Alright. I'm making you into, um, a ghost.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I am staying right here at the Krusty Krab picnic!
SpongeBob	It's a paper plate. Whoo!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, don't sign it!
SpongeBob	Simmy and Tally are holograms? Then that means...
SpongeBob	Old navy days?! Ohh!
SpongeBob	Ahh!
SpongeBob	I don't know!
SpongeBob	Huh? What is it, boy? Is someone in danger?
SpongeBob	Boy, Seor Poopus sure is hungry.
SpongeBob	Aww. So tiny and hungry. They have nobody to take care of them. I'm gonna take 'em home and feed 'em.
SpongeBob	There we go.
SpongeBob	Huh? What? Did you guys lose your bottle?
SpongeBob	I'll call you...
SpongeBob	Three bags of snail chow. Four bags of snail litter.
SpongeBob	Geez, my pants are getting ruined and my head is sticky. I gotta do something about that.
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. But I'm so busy taking care of these snails. I'll try to come in tomorrow.
SpongeBob	I don't know.
SpongeBob	I don't know. Let's count them shall we. One, two, three, Mary, Dani, Carmela, Seor Poopus, Jack, twenty-four, Paul, Brenda, Cheryl, Steve, One that keeps barfing on the floor, forty-eight,  Obulax, Vince, Mavis, Mavis Jr. Electric Ronnie, Dianne, Pam, Ninety-seven, Walter, Sarah, Bugaloo Shrimp,  a hundred forty-one, Viva, Tom, Thea, Ava, that's a hundred sixty-four, Old Ironsides, , Rhonda, Papa Pup, He Who Shall Not Be Named, two hundred thirty-three, Sean, Andy, Mr. Buster, Mrs. Buster, I'll say two hundred fifty-eight!

SpongeBob	No, thank you, please.  Oh no, Patrick. No outsidies for you.
SpongeBob	Hello.
SpongeBob	Seor Poopus.
SpongeBob	Bye, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Wow, Mr. Krabs really loves Founder's Day!
SpongeBob	Hey at least we have Founders Day!
SpongeBob	This feels wrong Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Well then don't do it, i'm sure Mr. Krabs will understand.
SpongeBob	What does that even mean?!
SpongeBob	Yeah, maybe it got picked too soon.
SpongeBob	This is gonna be written about it in the history book someday.
SpongeBob	Wow!
SpongeBob	Twelve. I'll... drive the car!
SpongeBob	Come on, Squidward! Wait!
SpongeBob	Now you roll after me.
SpongeBob	I'll... race the car!
SpongeBob	Good job, Squidward! You've won!
SpongeBob	One please.
SpongeBob	I'll eat one of those ice cream cones for ya.
SpongeBob	Training?
SpongeBob	Umm, excuse me, sir, you're sitting on my body, which is also my face.
SpongeBob	Ice cream!
SpongeBob	Hey, that guy was crying!
SpongeBob	Well, if it got me this ice cream, I like it!  I found something!
SpongeBob	Hey, go check in that ditch!
SpongeBob	Okay, never mind!  It's alright, Plankton, he's wearing sandals. What's the matter?
SpongeBob	Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night!  See, I can be a stand-up guy. See?
SpongeBob	Well, not all of me.
SpongeBob	Plankton, did you see that? I was a regular alpha-male!  Plankton?  Plankton, all my asserting is driving everybody away!
SpongeBob	Well, what about aggressively nice people?
SpongeBob	Gee, Plankton, I'm sorry about the Chum Bucket.
SpongeBob	Opening day is today! Tailgate party! []
SpongeBob	Ok, boss. Give me a job to do. Please?
SpongeBob	Done! Done!
SpongeBob	Um... are you sure about that boss?
SpongeBob	How about this?
SpongeBob	You ordered me too!
SpongeBob	Hiya, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Sewer, sewer! Cha-cha-cha! Sewer, sewer! Cha-cha-cha! Sewer, sewer! Cha-cha-cha!
SpongeBob	Hey! Over there!
SpongeBob	Well, bite 'em back!
SpongeBob	O Sole Mio.
SpongeBob	Oh. Crossing digested by a giant sewer snake off of my to-do list.
SpongeBob	I guess we're just lucky.
SpongeBob	Wow! Another Mermaid Man reboot. It's how I always re-imagined the reboot would be remade,
SpongeBob	Uh..well..I don't...uhhh...Okay!  How do I look?
SpongeBob	Yah, it must be the long pants!
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	No, merely a man, a man in longpants.  Oh, my precious longpants!
SpongeBob	Allow me ladies, I should pay, after all, I am a man, and I'm wearing...
SpongeBob	You know, I've never took the drivers test with long pants! I'll do it!
SpongeBob	Help wanted? Now this seems like a longpants establishment!   Today's special is a most amusing indian ocean seagrass, handpicked by indigenous prawns, prechewed by local manatees, and smothered in a rich, red algae.
SpongeBob	'Oh,  SpongeRobert.
SpongeBob	Well, were's all the party hats, where's the cake, and the clown? You can't have a party without a clown!
SpongeBob	Oh! Hey Squidward! Hey, do you understand what this movie is about?
SpongeBob	But wait, Squidward, I'll walk you out.  Squidward!
SpongeBob	Really!
SpongeBob	Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm not ready for long pants, I want my short pants back, but I can't because these are stuck on me.
SpongeBob	Oh!
SpongeBob	Gee, Larry. You think I'll ever be as strong as you?
SpongeBob	I'm ready!
SpongeBob	"Good. 'Cause I was really crashing here. Signing those papers.  Feelin' the burn? Is that what you call it? I heard Angel singing, ""Beautiful Angel"". That's normal, right?"
SpongeBob	Look, Larry! I hydrating! Oh, I am hydrating so much!
SpongeBob	I won't lie to you, Larry. Probably not.
SpongeBob	Yeah?
SpongeBob	Larry?
SpongeBob	No, Larry. Don't be silly. You don't have a potbelly.
SpongeBob	Walk on your back.
SpongeBob	You wanted to see me, sir?
SpongeBob	Oh, Larry, look at me! I'm too big to work the grill anymore! That makes me sad!
SpongeBob	Whoa, what happened?
SpongeBob	Oh, what a great day.
SpongeBob	Uh, natural greeting to you, friend.
SpongeBob	Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! What are the results?
SpongeBob	Whoo!!!
SpongeBob	Easy sneezy!
SpongeBob	We sure are, buddy!
SpongeBob	So, what's it gonna be boss?
SpongeBob	Ahem.
SpongeBob	Huh. Lost you there for a bit. We were at forty-seven.
SpongeBob	One, two, three, four, five. six,...
SpongeBob	Patrick, I think your ice cream only looks smaller, but the bowl is big.
SpongeBob	Uh... Oh. Yeah.
SpongeBob	Oh, come on!
SpongeBob	Patrick, you are making very poor choices!
SpongeBob	Done! Now to count the black sand.
SpongeBob	You open it!
SpongeBob	Et tu, Gary?
SpongeBob	Yoo-hoo!  Who wants their tummies tickled?
SpongeBob	I'm so honored, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Uh... One bouquet coming up, Mrs. Krabs [He steals some flowers from the crowd and makes a bouquet and Cashina throws it to Patrick, causing him to eat it.]
SpongeBob	Yah!
SpongeBob	Wow, giving someone a thumbs-up feels great!
SpongeBob	I sure have, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	...
SpongeBob	Whoo!
SpongeBob	Great job on not being afraid to ask for directions.
SpongeBob	The thumbs-up is an iconic, internationally-recognized sign of positivity and affirmation. Boop!
SpongeBob	What could do wrong?
SpongeBob	Hey, guy. Way to walk.
SpongeBob	my thumbs. My thumbs! MY THUMBS!!!!
SpongeBob	But doctor, I will be able to use my thumbs again, right?
SpongeBob	That's okay, Mr. Krabs. I understand.
SpongeBob	OI' Patty flippin' patties. Who'd a' thunk it, huh?
SpongeBob	And what might that be?
SpongeBob	Well I'm taking it back.
SpongeBob	Yeeeaaahh!
SpongeBob	La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
SpongeBob	I just mopped the floor with you.
SpongeBob	I am? Oh, thank you, Mr. Sharkface. Who are your friends?
SpongeBob	Do I get a jacket?
SpongeBob	Yeah, but what if they're hurt?
SpongeBob	Wah! Who's a baby?
SpongeBob	The cops!
SpongeBob	Uh, me? You know i'm not really the showdown type.
SpongeBob	Showdown? I can't fight in a showdown! I'll have to go into the Witness Protection program,  i'll have to quit working at The Krusty Krab, i'll never flip a succulent Krabby Patty ever again. Oh what have I done?  Hey yo Sponge-o, we were in your neck of the woods and decided to pickup your beloved pet Gary, if you wanna see him you better hightail your porous caboose over to the showdown, sincerely Sharkface and the other Sharks, Gary! No!  I have to save Gary, I have to go to the showdown! I have to get ready to fight!
SpongeBob	Squidward?! Oh no, I accidentally joined this bad boy gang and i'm suppose to fight in the showdown so I got to save Gary, and I don't wanna go into the Witness Protection program, but I can't fight cause you're my friend.
SpongeBob	What about the fruit vendor? He just gave you his fruit and ran away!
SpongeBob	Yay! I'm not a criminal by association.
SpongeBob	I'm so sorry officer, we were just dancing.
SpongeBob	You know Plankton, when you invited me over, I thought it was another trick to get the Krabby Patty formula. Now, I see you just love social gatherings in the workplace!
SpongeBob	[]
SpongeBob	Now that you ask, I don't know.  I think I just felt a twinge!
SpongeBob	Morning.
SpongeBob	Jelly fishing?
SpongeBob	Hey, look. Another handsome devil.  We'll call you Me Three [] Aww. Let's go flip some patties.
SpongeBob	[] Looks like you sponges have everything covered.
SpongeBob	Plankton! Me Two says you made him in a copy machine, so that you could steal the secret formula.
SpongeBob	What does that mean?
SpongeBob	Well, you see, its... Nice try, Plankton. But I'm the O.S. [] I can't believe they're all gone.
SpongeBob	Plankton, I'm a unique snowflake and snowflakes don't stomp. They skip []
SpongeBob	Who's Nick Fishkins?
SpongeBob	Morning, Squidward!
SpongeBob	"Yeah, he said it right on the TV, ""I wanna buy your home!"" But we haven't seen any money!"
SpongeBob	How much?
SpongeBob	Why?
SpongeBob	Hey, I could learn German!
SpongeBob	Huh? Oh, ya, I mean, sure, good morning! My name is SpongeBob, what is your name?
SpongeBob	Um, would you mind if I stay for zupper?  Whatchya having?
SpongeBob	Hello!  You must be Hedvig!
SpongeBob	I love outdoor concerts.
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	Poor Squidward. We should do something really nice for him!
SpongeBob	We flipped your house for ya.
SpongeBob	Yes, that's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants!
SpongeBob	Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools!  To me!
SpongeBob	Squidward, wait!
SpongeBob	They're right here, lady!
SpongeBob	April Fools! I'm right here!
SpongeBob	I...  I...
SpongeBob	Oh boy! Something for me to clean up!
SpongeBob	What do you want?
SpongeBob	I can't, I don't have a bottle opener.
SpongeBob	Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?
SpongeBob	Whoa, look at that cloud, Gary! It looks just like a giraffe eating ice cream.
SpongeBob	You're right, Gary, it's not a cloud at all.
SpongeBob	"""A great fortune has fallen upon you.""  Did you hear that Gary, the fortune is true! Let's look at your future.  ""Happy trails will follow you always.""  Your fortune came true too!"
SpongeBob	Oh, but that's where you're wrong, Squidward. These fortune cookies are different, try one.
SpongeBob	Those fortune cookies are a hit.
SpongeBob	Well, the fortunes in those cookies were always right before.  Here Mr. Krabs, maybe this next one will change your luck.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs, it's time.  It's time to give up the secret formula to Plankton! Because your life is worth more than some scrap of paper in a bottle.
SpongeBob	Oh, oh.
SpongeBob	Hmm, what brand should we buy, Hogen Duep?
SpongeBob	Oh, uh, actually, my name is Spon-
SpongeBob	Me!
SpongeBob	Ioh...
SpongeBob	"Hey, why does that barrel say ""sand""?"
SpongeBob	Hooray, finally!
SpongeBob	You mean my last one for today-ever?
SpongeBob	You turned the Krusty Krab into some kind of museum?
SpongeBob	Oh, and don't forget to buy souvenirs at the gift shop.
SpongeBob	Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.
SpongeBob	I'll come with you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Squidward? What are you doing here? I thought you were off following your dreams.
SpongeBob	Yeah, sure. I get it.
SpongeBob	Aww.
SpongeBob	Anyone can have a secret formula. We sell them in the gift shop.
SpongeBob	Sand?! It tastes like sand! Not good sand, either.
SpongeBob	Freshly grilled Krabby Patty, you and I are going to save the world. And save a friendship.
SpongeBob	Patrick, the Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand!
SpongeBob	Now that we've saved our friendship, we have to save the reputation of the Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	Absolutely! Well, Patrick helped.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, just a nibble.
SpongeBob	Mmm-hey!
SpongeBob	Isn't it a little early for autumn, Sandy?
SpongeBob	Whoa. Who are you?
SpongeBob	Meant to be eatin' eh?
SpongeBob	Uh huh. Uh huh. Surely the Shalmon isn't a sham.
SpongeBob	Uh oh. Sandy's tree's not lookin' so good. I don't think it can take much more of this, Patrick.
SpongeBob	The tree got real sick!
SpongeBob	Wait! I have an idea!
SpongeBob	See, Mr. Krabs? The community bulletin board is a good thing.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, Surfer Fish is right. The board is sacred and it must be respected.
SpongeBob	"Huh?  ""Dumb-blurted! LOL!""?, ""What's the Point""?, ""I could make a better patty out of mud""?! Where are all these notes coming from?"
SpongeBob	No, it's not round enough. Uh, maybe just a little off the edge here.
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob	"That's for me! ""Fry-Banshee139, more like Cry-Baby139!"" Cordially, P-Star7."
SpongeBob	It's this P-Star7. He's been saying terrible things about me and the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	You can't Mr. Krabs! It's for the community! I'll still believe in the power of the bulletin board!
SpongeBob	A lesson in polite manners.
SpongeBob	Negatory. Pineapple1 to Delicate Flower. Come in, Delicate Flower.
SpongeBob	Patrick, you're P-Star7?
SpongeBob	Pineapple1 to Knitmama. Can I needle you for a little more yarn?
SpongeBob	Woo!
SpongeBob	Yes!
SpongeBob	Oh, how did you know?
SpongeBob	Come on, Squidward! Give it a try!
SpongeBob	Peep!
SpongeBob	Don't worry, guys. We can still win Food Con. There's one patty left.
SpongeBob	Positions everyone!
SpongeBob	Squidward, you've saved the Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob	Patrick, no!
SpongeBob	Great idea, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	No, Mr. Krabs! I will not! But I will give you these.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, remember Food Con!
SpongeBob	Oh, hi.
SpongeBob	Yes, a sandwich has no reason to lie.
SpongeBob	Guys, we're here!
SpongeBob	Nature Patty?!
SpongeBob	Hmm... what's this?
SpongeBob	Gary, get off of that! You'll spot my masterpiece!
SpongeBob	"""Dear SpongeBob, Wow! You know how to fly?"" Fly? What does he mean by..."
SpongeBob	I don't want to let him down and say that I can't fly! 'Cause then, his dying wish will never come true!
SpongeBob	"""Dear SpongeBob, I'll be at the Bikini Bottom Air Show tomorrow. Please meet me there so I can finally see you fly?!""  Oh no! What have I done? What have I done? What have I done? I can't fly, Gary! I'm not a flier! I'm a liar!"
SpongeBob	No, no. It's not that. It's... it's...
SpongeBob	By who I've a where's in?
SpongeBob	Seatbelt, check. Controls, check.
SpongeBob	Oop. I've forgot to feed Gary.
SpongeBob	Did I do it?
SpongeBob	"I just wanted to say that today... Today...  ""Today is the first day of the rest of your life. I promise to fly to the best of my ability just for you."" Oh, I will not let you down."
SpongeBob	Sandy, I'm nervous.
SpongeBob	Pen Pal, this one's for you.
SpongeBob	But... but you said you were dying! You're not dying!
SpongeBob	Excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me!
SpongeBob	Hold on! We're going down!
SpongeBob	Let's hear 'em.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, are you alright? What happened?
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs, how do you know it will be safe from Plankton at my house?
SpongeBob	Okay, bye!
SpongeBob	Bye, Gary!
SpongeBob	Whew! It's safe and right where I left it.
SpongeBob	Something's not right, Gary.
SpongeBob	Looks like one of my old grocery lists.
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	Great! Well, see ya out there.
SpongeBob	Gee, Mr. Krabs, do you think the rip current will hit the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	Congratulations, Squidward! Uh, I mean Captain Squidward!
SpongeBob	You remember Mr. Krabs. He's the man who brought you the Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	NO! MR. KRABS!
SpongeBob	Whoa! Where are we?
SpongeBob	Captain Squidward!
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm afraid the crew insists, sir.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, you're alive! Oh, welcome back, captain!
SpongeBob	Do something, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	It's the first dime you ever earned and I'm going to tear it up if you don't go back to being the meanie we need!
SpongeBob	Spend it.
SpongeBob	Mmm! Isn't this salt water taffy just tafflicious?
SpongeBob	How does that help?
SpongeBob	Oh.
SpongeBob	Aww, come on, Patrick.  The doctor will fix you right up.
SpongeBob	Oh, I wanna see!
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick. But that means your tooth won't be going to Tooth Island.
SpongeBob	Of course, I guess your baby tooth could be happy in your mouth all alone by itself.
SpongeBob	"Patrick, Dr. Mundane always says, ""If you can't bite, things ain't right."""
SpongeBob	Squidward, why would you want to do that?
SpongeBob	Patrick, wait!
SpongeBob	It's a scrapbook of all my baby teeth.  Ha. That was a good one. I remember every tooth. Even though they're no longer in my mouth, I still keep the memory of them in my heart.
SpongeBob	It's true!
SpongeBob	This is where parents and friends take teeth so they can be ferried to Tooth Island.
SpongeBob	Mm, sure Patrick. Anything for a pal.
SpongeBob	Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield...
SpongeBob	Uhh, Patrick...
SpongeBob	Like?
SpongeBob	I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.
SpongeBob	May the best man win.
SpongeBob	Perfect!
SpongeBob	You mean, Patrick can't come?
SpongeBob	I... I...  I don't wanna go!
SpongeBob	What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?
SpongeBob	Do you think it will make the game more exciting if we played it with...  two sticks?
SpongeBob	I want it!
SpongeBob	No, it's mine!
SpongeBob	It's just me, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Wow, Patrick! I've never seen the world from this angel before!
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick. I know who we can spy on.
SpongeBob	Hooray! Now, we can play whirly brains with the whole neighborhood! Hey, kid! Race ya to the end of the street!
SpongeBob	Aw, our remote controls are dead too! Oh, Patrick, I don't want to jump to any conclusions here, but I think that we have lost our minds!
SpongeBob	Brainy, where are you?
SpongeBob	Oh, uh, ma'am, you forgot something.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I meant on the phone.
SpongeBob	Whew! I'll never be a no-brainer again!
SpongeBob	Oh, no need to thank us, Sandy. If we can just make one angry old man happy, that and itself is thanks enough. The dignity of the elderly was the victor here today.
SpongeBob	This must be the secret lair of an evil villain!
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward. Wanna play  with us?
SpongeBob	Doctor Negative!
SpongeBob	Although our foes were evil, their nutrition did not go to waste, Doctor Negative.
SpongeBob	Oh, did you say something negative, Doctor Negative?
SpongeBob	Oh! We've forgot the peroxide.
SpongeBob	Uh-oh, Patrick. I think we got Squidward in trouble.
SpongeBob	"Oh, Mr. Krabs. It's right here in Mermaid Man Number 98. ""No superhero shall fight a super villain until that super villain has committed a crime."""
SpongeBob	Yep!
SpongeBob	Okay, Captain Tightwad! Doctor Negative, you can come out now!
SpongeBob	Boo-hoo? Do you expect us to cry?
SpongeBob	Oh boy, Mr. Krabs! That was the best Mermaid Man playdate ever!
SpongeBob	Imitation plus flattery equals happy people.
SpongeBob	Or never, whichever comes first.
SpongeBob	I'm gonna eat ice cream and go jellyfishing with my good buddy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Cattywampus, Plankton. You're just about the teeniest gal-dang critter I ever did see. Yee-haw!
SpongeBob	Really? I always use science for evil!
SpongeBob	Oh, you want some napkins, please?
SpongeBob	The mocking mimicry madness.
SpongeBob	Hi! Ahoy! Howdy! Greetings! Go away!
SpongeBob	Good morning, Gary! Meow. Duh! Me money!  Karate chop! Ha! I went to college! I said eat your patties!  I can't do it! I'm a freak! A freak!  I'm a freak!
SpongeBob	B.
SpongeBob	Thanks, guys, you're the best friends a guy with memory loss could have. It sure feels great to just be yourself. Doesn't it, guys? Guys?
SpongeBob	Yow!
SpongeBob	You see anything?
SpongeBob	Ooh! That tickles! More like prickles. Hey, I think I'll call you, Prickles!
SpongeBob	Aw, stop, stop! Oh, Gary, I don't to hear the little guy cry.
SpongeBob	Nighty-night, Prickles.
SpongeBob	Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo!
SpongeBob	Guys? Guyguys?
SpongeBob	Gary, I need to take a shower.
SpongeBob	I understand, sir. Mr. Krabs, will you excuse me for a second?  Prickles, you heard my boss. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you and your friends to leave, please.
SpongeBob	What am I gonna do?
SpongeBob	You gotta help me!
SpongeBob	Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!  I need a hug!
SpongeBob	Oh, that's better. Looks like I really wormed my way out of that one.
SpongeBob	Oh, hi, Squidward? How ya doing?
SpongeBob	We've got to keep it quiet.
SpongeBob	I don't know.
SpongeBob	Aww.
SpongeBob	Maybe we should get him up.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick. It didn't work.
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, you go in first and control his arms and legs. Then I'll go in and control the brain.
SpongeBob	My name is Squidward, and I think SpongeBob is a lamebrain.
SpongeBob	Left foot, right foot.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I just realized I don't know where the concert hall is.
SpongeBob	Whoa!
SpongeBob	I was just, oh, um,  the thing is not on the thing.  Oh, uh...
SpongeBob	Let's see, the ability to play clarinet has got to be in his brain somewhere. It's just a matter of squeezing it out.
SpongeBob	Higher! Go higher!
SpongeBob	Maybe we should make a break for it, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, you can't take that check. We're not high-class caterers.
SpongeBob	"What do you think of this, Mr. Krabs?  I call it, ""Krabby Pt."" Classy, huh? Serve it while it's hot, Patrick."
SpongeBob	Oh, upstairs. I went left, then right, then double and triple right, then down, up, and right 18 more times. Then do four somersaults, a barrel roll, jump backwards twice, spin till you get sick...  And you're there.
SpongeBob	Did somebody call my name?
SpongeBob	Help!
SpongeBob	You know, I can't go to the Krusty Krab. But I can play Krusty Krab!  Oh! This could be the register boat!  And you can be Squidward!
SpongeBob	Okay, you guys. Just make yourself comfortable. More patties on the way!
SpongeBob	Sorry, I ran out of napkins. You'll have to use a $100 bill.
SpongeBob	Oh, that's more than generous!
SpongeBob	Did you get rid of the ghost?
SpongeBob	Where?
SpongeBob	Suit yourself.
SpongeBob	Yeah!  We're gonna be the best roommates ever! Oh! Wanna do each other's hair?
SpongeBob	Now, tell SpongeBob why you and Karen got into a fight.
SpongeBob	Plankton, in a word: yes!
SpongeBob	Try this one.
SpongeBob	Great. So turn to Patrick and say something nice.
SpongeBob	No, I think we better try something else.
SpongeBob	That wasn't even close to what I said.
SpongeBob	Oh, I like that!  Boop beep! Beep boop boop!
SpongeBob	Plankton, I don't want to eat this!
SpongeBob	You better step off, lady. No one can make Plankton happy like I can. We are soulmates, and we're going to get married and print 1,347 babies.
SpongeBob	Oh, that is so sweet!
SpongeBob	Well, yes. Yes, I have.
SpongeBob	Ah! Okay, thanks!
SpongeBob	It's my life insurance. I got one for you too!
SpongeBob	Remarkable!  You can hit me all you want...  ... yet I can't be damaged! This life insurance is really working.
SpongeBob	Oh-oh, no, Patrick, I'm slipping...and falling!  I didn't even break a bone!
SpongeBob	Squidward, what were you yelling?
SpongeBob	Gee, Squidward,  maybe you should get some life insurance.
SpongeBob	Yay! It works!
SpongeBob	You see, Squidward? You're immune!
SpongeBob	What are you doing, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Squidward is gonna try out The Sushi Maker.
SpongeBob	D-d-d-d-do or die?! Squidward, come down! You're not invincible! Life insurance is not what you think! You were right! Oh, it was just dumb luck!
SpongeBob	Squidward, how did you survive The Sushi Maker?
SpongeBob	Yes, Mrs. Puff!
SpongeBob	Butbut
SpongeBob	Your boat.  Sure, Patrick. See you later.
SpongeBob	Pleasant day for a drive, hey, Officer?
SpongeBob	You'll never believe it! I was out driving all day! Yes, driving! First, I drove down the street like this!
SpongeBob	Hmm?
SpongeBob	One bubble boat coming right up!
SpongeBob	I'll never blow enough bubble boats at this rate. Yahoo!
SpongeBob	Whoa!
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff, you're ready.
SpongeBob	Oh, no, Mrs. Puff! You got on the freeway by mistake! Look out!
SpongeBob	Oh no. What's gonna happen when they hit the surface?
SpongeBob	Well, Mrs. Puff, looks like I have to get my boating license after all. See you tomorrow in class! La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	Good morning to you, sir. Would you care to blow a bubble?
SpongeBob	Thank you.
SpongeBob	And now... with two hands!
SpongeBob	That'll be 25 cents, sir.
SpongeBob	You're not doing the technique.
SpongeBob	You said it, Squidward. See, it is all in the technique!
SpongeBob	Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Don't let em get me, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	I can't leave now. I'm working.
SpongeBob	All I know is that Mr. Krabs said...Patrick, don't do that!
SpongeBob	Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back. Oh, my best friend.  Patrick, you're alive.
SpongeBob	Well, no.
SpongeBob	This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Gift shop?
SpongeBob	I always go to work this way.
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs said...
SpongeBob	Psst, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Of course not.  I mean, not exactly.  I mean yes! Yes I did it! I admit it!  Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me! I'm hooked!
SpongeBob	Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs. I can't do it! Anything but that!
SpongeBob	Aye-aye, Mr.Whoa!
SpongeBob	I still don't see Plankton doing anything wrong. Maybe he really is retiring.
SpongeBob	Hurray! I knew you'd get it, Mr.  Krabs!
SpongeBob	Sorry.
SpongeBob	Oh, the toppings haven't been prepped! I wish this lettuce and tomato would just cut themselves up!
SpongeBob	Oh, I wish these Krabby Patties would just serve themselves so I could keep cooking.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I wish you wouldn't worry about money at a time like this!
SpongeBob	This is awesome! I will use this magic spatula to help everyone.
SpongeBob	Of course I do, for I am SpongeBob, Emperor of the Sea.
SpongeBob	I think I know a way to make you both happy.
SpongeBob	No sponge should have this much power.
SpongeBob	Well, take your trident. I don't want it anymore.
SpongeBob	Ahh! Make it stop!
SpongeBob	Let's get 'em!
SpongeBob	Hey! SpringBoob SquirePin stole my idea!
SpongeBob	I can't believe it, Gary. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, in our home.
SpongeBob	Don't worry. There's no danger.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Mermaid Man. You won't be hearing from me for just anything. Only for the big emergencies.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Barnacle Boy. I didn't mean it. I just wanted to spend time with you. You're my heroes!
SpongeBob	Tons. Like the windshield wipers are right here.
SpongeBob	But you said he could snap...  ...just like that.
SpongeBob	It doesn't seem to be here.
SpongeBob	I found it and it's the special dance mix!
SpongeBob	I am?
SpongeBob	What we gonna do?
SpongeBob	Dee, dee, doo, doo... Here is some for you. And here is a little for you. And, that should do it for today.  PATRICK IS WASTING WATER!
SpongeBob	Now, we put this captured water to good use.
SpongeBob	Wow! Those are great, Patrick! Let's see what they look like on your feet.
SpongeBob	Look at this knot. Have you ever seen a more perfectly executed shoe-fastening bow?
SpongeBob	Well,  I guess you don't want me to show you how to do it.
SpongeBob	Patrick, aren't you late for something?
SpongeBob	Well, a sponge has to look his spongiest.  Well, I've gotta get to work.  Oh, barnacles! maybe I should just lay here.
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Squidward.
SpongeBob	I've failed. My career is over. I'm sorry, spatula.  I'm sorry, hat.  I'm sorry, floor.  I am sorry, Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	I... I... I... I... I...
SpongeBob	Could you show me how to tie my shoes?
SpongeBob	Doesn't anybody know how to tie a knot?!
SpongeBob	Hooray!
SpongeBob	Those are great, Mr. Flying Dutchman, sir. Now can you show me how to tie my shoes?
SpongeBob	Just leave me and me untied shoes alone, Gary  Okay, Gary, you have my attention.
SpongeBob	What wonders await me today?
SpongeBob	Man, oh man do I love my job!
SpongeBob	Goo Goo. Ga Ga!
SpongeBob	No! Nononono!
SpongeBob	Fascinating. He has a sensationality!
SpongeBob	Ahh! The wonders of modern-day technology!  What astonishing and distractionable adventures will you lead me on today! Okay SpongeBob, you've got to figure out about the times! You have got to figure out...  Snapper Chat!
SpongeBob	"Beautiful!  You've got my vote!  28 days?  No!  ""Nuv'mund' I'm back."" Phew, that was close!"
SpongeBob	"Ooh! A message from Patrick!  ""Hey, just hangin' out here.""  Patrick I don't think you're using the camera correctly."
SpongeBob	I was just testing it.
SpongeBob	You've gotta let go of the dime.
SpongeBob	The cash register... Wow! Squidward, who's gonna work the grill?
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward. All done with those errands?
SpongeBob	Oh, hi, Squidward!  How are those errands going?
SpongeBob	Aye-aye, Mr. Tentacles.  Boy, no wonder Mr. Krabs put him in charge.
SpongeBob	But I haven't...
SpongeBob	Uh, does that mean you're...?
SpongeBob	What a wonderful day!
SpongeBob	That's not gonna do it! Think harder!
SpongeBob	Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick.
SpongeBob	SpongeBob SquarePants at your service, for I am an honorary crossing guard.
SpongeBob	You're wel...  welcome.
SpongeBob	"I almost forgot. It's ""Surprise Sandy Day.""  The only question is how to surprise her."
SpongeBob	To clean and polish it.
SpongeBob	Squidward, have you seen our pie? The one we spent all morning cooking just for you.
SpongeBob	That's right!  A sundae!  Whoops... Looks like we're out of ice cream. Guess I'll have to use something else... Ketchup!  Hmmm... Bananas... Cherries... Boring.  Ah, here we go! Onions!  Ready, Gary?
SpongeBob	Was it something I said?  Something weird is going on today. Everyone is running away from me. And now...  ...giant piles of bubble gum?! Oh, what next?
SpongeBob	Good one, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Oh no! I can't be ugly! I can't be! I can't be ugly!  Am I ugly?  Am I ugly?
SpongeBob	That didn't help at all.  How long? How long have I been ugly, Patrick?
SpongeBob	I know, Patrick.
SpongeBob	I'm ugly and I'm proud.
SpongeBob	I'm ugly and I'm proud!  I'm ugly and I'm proud! I'm ugly and I'm proud!
SpongeBob	Hi. I am very ugly. But you should enjoy the movie anyway.  Excuse me, sir. I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you.
SpongeBob	Hi.
SpongeBob	Patrick, is everything okay in here?  What are you doing in there, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Patrick...?
SpongeBob	Arrgh,  Patrick! What did you eat?!
SpongeBob	Sundae...  Patrick! My sundae gave us rancid breath!
SpongeBob	Squidward, are we there yet?
SpongeBob	Yes sir, Squidward.  Sorry, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Aaaahhh. Are we there yet?
SpongeBob	Well, Patrick? Did you learn your......lesson?
SpongeBob	Woo! Hooray!  The new spatulas are here!
SpongeBob	Okey-dokey, Squidward. And then we'll get those new spatulas!
SpongeBob	I like surprises.
SpongeBob	Sorry Pearl, but this item's not on the menu!
SpongeBob	Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here.
SpongeBob	The Kool Krab.  Or the Kowboy Krab!  The Kurly Krab.  The Kreepy Krab.  The Killer Krab!
SpongeBob	Well, hip people have to eat too. Back to the grill.  The customers may be hot but my grill is hotter.
SpongeBob	All right.  Okay, no buns. That's hip.  No patties  happenin.'  Oh yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw.
SpongeBob	Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, um, I think we have a problem.
SpongeBob	There there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way.
SpongeBob	Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second?
SpongeBob	"I got it! I can pretend to  ""fire you."" I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later."
SpongeBob	It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that...
SpongeBob	Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it!
SpongeBob	Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary!
SpongeBob	And since we're all ready at the beach!
SpongeBob	See, Patrick? Now that is surfing!
SpongeBob	Hm-m-m, maybe I could use some help blowing up these balloons.  Say, Gary, I was wondering if...  Hmmm... the hotline.  Hey-hey, Squid, old buddy.
SpongeBob	Aw, don't cry, you little dickens.  Tu-jh-Tu-jh. You're in good hands.  There you are, darling. Lots of vitamins in there.
SpongeBob	Nothing to do, eh?
SpongeBob	Help me pick out an outfit for the party, Gary Bear.
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary. You are a real stickler for authenticity.  Da-ta-dah. Ta-dah, Ta-dah, Ta-dah, Ta-dah. Da, Da, Da, Da.
SpongeBob	"And if I saw a frown, ""Aha!"" I'd turn it upside down!  And as for toxic waste, I don't care for the taste."
SpongeBob	Hold still, Gary.
SpongeBob	"""For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?"""
SpongeBob	Exactly!
SpongeBob	You'll get an award one day.
SpongeBob	Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?
SpongeBob	The smallest you can think of.
SpongeBob	You have to work for it, remember?
SpongeBob	Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table.
SpongeBob	All you have to do is answer the phone.
SpongeBob	You'll do fine.
SpongeBob	Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar.  Easy. Now you try. First get a jar.  Patrick, that's a pickle.
SpongeBob	No, no, Patrick, you did it!
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready...  Huh?
SpongeBob	Dropped my spatula.
SpongeBob	Well, it's annoying, so stop it!
SpongeBob	Stop copying me!
SpongeBob	I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me.  Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'.
SpongeBob	Sure.
SpongeBob	Rule number two: never, ever try to capture a baby jellyfish.
SpongeBob	These poor souls are here because they found themselves for the wrong side of a jellyfish stinger. Not if they're the right side.  The point is, that we will all be respectful...
SpongeBob	Aw, you poor thing, have some flowers.
SpongeBob	I think we've all learned something here for today. Thanks for watching.
SpongeBob	Patrick, with this time machine we can go back to the past and make our young selves wiser.
SpongeBob	Do the cyclops!
SpongeBob	Hi, Patrick, what are you reading?
SpongeBob	Huh? Oh, yea verily, Squidward.
SpongeBob	I don't get it. The water's fine.  Hey Squidward! Want to play?
SpongeBob	Hi Squidward!
SpongeBob	Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet!
SpongeBob	Bubble Buddy's thirsty.
SpongeBob	Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties!
SpongeBob	Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward...
SpongeBob	See what I mean?
SpongeBob	Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah!
SpongeBob	Hey everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy?
SpongeBob	Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern.
SpongeBob	No! You can't! He's not just a bubble, he's a Bubble Buddy! He's my friend and I love him! Haven't you ever had a very special friend?
SpongeBob	So long.
SpongeBob	Plankton, huh? Wait! Now would they call me PlanktonShoe SquarePants? Well I like the ring of it. There's only one logical option.  Well that's one mystery solved, now it's on to the next. Where am I?
SpongeBob	I think not. You, sir are Orin J. Ruffy.
SpongeBob	Gee, Sandy! I can't wait to see the inside.
SpongeBob	Yep.
SpongeBob	Aww! Look, cute.  Kinda reminds me of bubble blowing.
SpongeBob	Sorry, I didn't think you meant it literally!
SpongeBob	Hey, hey, don't be down. I know just the thing to get you out of this funk.
SpongeBob	Oh, but Mr. Krabs, I did accidentally destroyed their way of life.
SpongeBob	He needs to get the composition just right.  Now?
SpongeBob	No, the line. Can you give the line more feeling?
SpongeBob	Cut! More feeling!
SpongeBob	Oh!
SpongeBob	I thought you wanted to talk to people about frozen Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	Order up, Squidward!
SpongeBob	I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size.  Do you love it?
SpongeBob	"Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I heard a... wow! A pie!  It's from Squidward.  ""To SpongeBob... Well, here you go."""
SpongeBob	Yes?
SpongeBob	Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list.
SpongeBob	Then let's roll!  Bye, Mr. Krabs.  Heads up, Squidwardlooks like they're gonna replace you.
SpongeBob	I'm going to show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit.
SpongeBob	Look out, everyone, friends in reverse!
SpongeBob	Watch the sunset with Squidward.
SpongeBob	Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me,  ...and this brick wall that you built between us.
SpongeBob	I guess we started too early. Let's start again.
SpongeBob	You want me to explode?
SpongeBob	Why would I do that?
SpongeBob	Patrick and I had to go to carnival! It's the world's biggest party! 2 million people at 10 daily!
SpongeBob	Calm down, Patrick! You never had any ears!
SpongeBob	Brazil's Amazon holds some amazing plants that can be found nowhere else in the world, such as the Brazil Nut!
SpongeBob	Oh, barnacles! Considered one of the 7 natural wonders of the world, the Iguassu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina are enormous!!
SpongeBob	Here are the colorful boats that travel the canals in Xochimilco.
SpongeBob	One of my most favorite places on land is Plaza Garibaldi in Mexico City! You can find a mariachi band to play a serenade for your girlfriend! Patrick, do you play instruments?
SpongeBob	What would your name be if you were a luchadore and not Patrick?
SpongeBob	That's just a reflection on the water. Here we are in Obras Douro Square. Many Pilgrims come to visit San Tiago's tour of the confedral.
SpongeBob	Uh, no.
SpongeBob	Good talk, Patrick.
SpongeBob	The first thing Patrick and I did in Russia was take a troika ride out to Siberia where Patrick made a new friend.
SpongeBob	Russia is famous for its nesting dolls, also known as matryoshka dolls. Each one has a series of smaller dolls hidden inside it.
SpongeBob	The bear is a wide spread symbol for Russia. So, we were excited to meet one here. His name is Teddy. He's kind of shy. Didn't really like us taking his picture.
SpongeBob	"Good one, Patrick! French people call her, ""The Iron Lady."""
SpongeBob	While in France, Patrick and I took a boat trip on the Seine River. What did you think?
SpongeBob	And we turned into Invincibubble and Mr. Superawesomeness in con to see all the movie stars. Hey Patrick, you're a movie star.
SpongeBob	Why, yesyes I am.
SpongeBob	Don't worry Mr. Krabs, as long as these pants are square,  and this sponge is Bob,  I will not let you down!
SpongeBob	No free napkins?
SpongeBob	No sign of Plankton, yet. Gosh, Mr. Krabs. You don't look so good.  Ooh, you're so cold.
SpongeBob	You gave him the day off.
SpongeBob	But I thought you wanted to ask me a question.
SpongeBob	Scrub-a-dub-dub, I love to rub.  Hey Mr. Krabs, just doing a little scrubbin'.
SpongeBob	But sir, we haven't done the secret handshake yet.
SpongeBob	Almost.
SpongeBob	Quiet!  Until I know who the real Mr. Krabs is, nobody moves,  nobody gets hurt.
SpongeBob	Right.  That's one strike, Mr. Fake.
SpongeBob	Right again!  You're starting to look pretty phony right about now. I'd be nervous if I were you. Now only the really real Mr. Krabs could answer this  If we're discussing the secret formula on the third Wednesday in January and it's not raining outside after we've gargled with vanilla pudding, what do we do?
SpongeBob	This must be your lucky day.
SpongeBob	Gee, Mr. Krabs. I'm sorry. I thought you were a phony.
SpongeBob	Uh, no it's not.
SpongeBob	Aren't we all?
SpongeBob	Our first trip in Germany was to Neuschwanstein Castle.
SpongeBob	Berlin is also known for its funky nightlife. There are plenty of concerts and dance clubs.
SpongeBob	Uh, no it does not have a pretty princess.
SpongeBob	Here we are at ancient Stonehenge. Apologies for the photo, but after Patrick knocked down some of those rocks, we had to exit lickety-split.
SpongeBob	Patrick, remember when we saw the London Eye?
SpongeBob	Here we are at the famous Abbey Road, where we got a tip that we might meet a walrus. Coo Coo Cachoo! Unfortunately, the walrus never showed up.
SpongeBob	Patrick and I couldn't go to Australia and not visit the Sydney Harbor and not witness its iconic view. Why it's almost as iconic as...
SpongeBob	We had so much fun at the Luna Park in Melbourne!
SpongeBob	I'm off to work at the Krusty Krab, frying up patties and bladdity blab!  Huh? That's new. Strange place to park a car. Whats this for?
SpongeBob	But what about winter sports, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Just throwing another tire for the fire for Global Warming, Mr. Krabs!  Hey, look! It's working! The entire town is heading this way to cool off.
SpongeBob	Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the most important living creatures on the planet.
SpongeBob	Eww.  What's happening to me?
SpongeBob	Coming.
SpongeBob	Could I borrow a couple of these?
SpongeBob	I could use a hand here!
SpongeBob	That's okay. I already split my pants! Get it?
SpongeBob	Ripped... pants.  Ripped pants a la mode!  Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants?
SpongeBob	"Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think! Your public's waiting.  Let's see...  ""Lifting weights - big laugh,"" ""Frisbee in face - kills,"" ""Surfing - knocks 'em dead,"" ""Pretending to drown,""  NO. Come on, think! I got it! Hey, everybody!  Not ripped pants!  Pants ripped off. Huh? Someone call the police. There's a pants thief on the loose!  Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We blew it, pants."
SpongeBob	I lost my best friend.
SpongeBob	Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!
SpongeBob	Gee, Patrick, I didn't know you spoke bird.
SpongeBob	What's that lump in its belly?
SpongeBob	Aw look, isn't he just precious? Let's take him out to play.  998... 999... 1000. Ready or not, here I come!
SpongeBob	He's gotta be in here.  I think something bad happened to Wormy.
SpongeBob	Let's not panic. We just have to stick together. Remember it's two against one. Right Patrick? Patrick?  He's eaten Patrick!  Patrick, you're alive!
SpongeBob	It's working. He's gonna answer it...
SpongeBob	I'm coming, Patrick!  No, Mr. Monster, please don't eat me! No, no, no! Spare me, I don't taste good, no! No, no, please! Wait a second.  Yeah!  We did it, Patrick! Sandy's gonna be so proud of us. We got that horrible monster out of her house and best of all her pets are safe. 'Cause that horrible creature is now......heading straight for the Krusty Krab!  It's going in the front! Let's use the secret entrance.
SpongeBob	Oh no, Mr. Krabs. It doesn't want to eat Krabby Patties. It wants to eat YOU!
SpongeBob	We tried to warn them. I can't watch.
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, now this is a very delicate situation. It must be treated with great care and sensitivity.
SpongeBob	We did it Patrick! We saved the city.  Just think what might of happened if we didn't tell everyone about the monster.
SpongeBob	Get a hold of yourself, Eugene. I'm going in.  Take it easy, friend. I'm the manager of this establishment.  Everything's gonna be just fine.
SpongeBob	That's what it's all about. I want you to do me a favor, Phil.
SpongeBob	Who's it gonna be, Gary? Well, let's ask my wall of 374 consecutive employee-of-the-month awards.
SpongeBob	I have to tell you something, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Okay. see you at the ceremony.
SpongeBob	Oh, I mean.
SpongeBob	Eww, I think I stepped in something.
SpongeBob	Yay! Yeah! Yeah! Now we're talking! Yeah!
SpongeBob	That's me.
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	I guess so, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs thinks I'm a kid.
SpongeBob	Yeah. I'm not in a Goober mood.
SpongeBob	Boy, Pat, that hit the spot. I'm feeling better already.
SpongeBob	All right, folks, this one goes out to my two bestest friends in the whole world:  Patrick and this big peanut guy. It's a little ditty called...
SpongeBob	I've got something to say about Mr.  Krabs.
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Oh, Your Highness, I'm sure it's not that noticeable... Bald! Bald!}}
SpongeBob	No! I won't let you.
SpongeBob	Wait. How did you know my name?
SpongeBob	... are gonna get that crown back and save you from Neptune's wrath. You've got nothing to worry about. Your life is in our hands.  Patrick, let's go get that crown!
SpongeBob	Yeah, wow!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick. They're laughing next to us.
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.
SpongeBob	Yeah! Moving on. Just keep going.
SpongeBob	We must be close by now...Patrick, look.  We're doing great! Shell City's only five days away!
SpongeBob	There it is, Pat. The key! Now, how are we gonna get it?
SpongeBob	Okay...I guess it really doesn't matter who does the distraction.
SpongeBob	Well, I got my hands dirty for nothing.  Patrick, check it out!
SpongeBob	Man, that was a close call.
SpongeBob	Whee!
SpongeBob	Enjoy, Patrick's tummy.
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick. Load the potatoes!
SpongeBob	Wait a minute, Patrick. Look! He's got a tank!
SpongeBob	Yes, sir!  Extra ketchup, extra mustard.
SpongeBob	Robot! Robot! ROBOT! GIANT ROBOT! Robot! Robot!  Mr. Krabs! Plankton's here, and he's got a giant robot!
SpongeBob	Look at Mr. Krabs go! I've never seen him gloat this hard before.
SpongeBob	No! Never! I'm on team Krabs for life!!
SpongeBob	Normally, I'd agree with you, Mr. Krabs, but this time, he's telling the truth! It just vanished!
SpongeBob	How can we make more Krabby Patties without the secret formula?!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, Plankton didn't take the secret formula.
SpongeBob	You may want to step back a little, Mr. Krabs. This could get messy.
SpongeBob	Sorry, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Now we work together. You know, teamwork.
SpongeBob	Teamwork.
SpongeBob	Put 'em together, what do you got?
SpongeBob	That's exactly what I was thinking.
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, you're in.
SpongeBob	Sandy!  Sandy?  Sandy. Sandy, are you home? Gee, Plankton, I wonder where she is. What is all this stuff?  Sandy?
SpongeBob	And that would be?
SpongeBob	What do you mean you don't have to do as I say anymore?
SpongeBob	Because they're right on our tail.  Oh, right, snails.
SpongeBob	That's kinda gross, Plankton.
SpongeBob	You know, Plankton? I think you might know a little bit more about teamwork than you lead on.
SpongeBob	Were you in my brain?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	It is. And if we're gonna be on the same team--
SpongeBob	Enihcam emit a tuohtiw ton.
SpongeBob	That sounds great, Plankton, but how do we build a time machine?
SpongeBob	'Cause the food's really bad.
SpongeBob	Hmm. Wait. The window is open. Come on, Plankton, it's time for some teamwork. Give me a boost.
SpongeBob	We're in.
SpongeBob	No! Plankton, help!  I'll rock him, you tell him a bedtime story.
SpongeBob	It's still warm.
SpongeBob	Oh, okay.
SpongeBob	Okay, now for the brains.
SpongeBob	What's that over there?
SpongeBob	Great Krabby Patty Famine? Oh, what year is this?
SpongeBob	I think we may be lost in time, Plankton. Maybe we should ask this guy for directions. Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us when we are?
SpongeBob	Oh, so you're the one keeping the meteors from hitting us.
SpongeBob	Maybe we should split up the work load.  You watch the one with the big red eye,  and I'll watch the one with the ringy thingies, like a team.
SpongeBob	Sorry.
SpongeBob	Nope. He's helping me.
SpongeBob	Hold still you!
SpongeBob	It's not a good idea to have a sacrifice on an empty stomach.  Who wants a Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	But, even failure hurts a little less when you do it as a team, right?
SpongeBob	Well, we wouldn't even be in this mess in the first place if you weren't so selfish and evil!
SpongeBob	Look at me. Why, I've become like all of you. Savage. Fear-ridden. Selfish. An entire town of formerly good citizens, turned into heartless freaks, bent on their own self-prever...Self-preter...
SpongeBob	Come on, everybody! I've got some Krabby Patty orders to fill!  It's coming from over there!  Come on, guys! I think it's just over this hill!
SpongeBob	It's about being a team and sticking together no matter what.
SpongeBob	Well, Bubbles, I'm glad we could help.
SpongeBob	"No, if he was eating us, he'd be chewing us up and we'd be going down there. This is what you call ""riding in style."""
SpongeBob	Come on, guys. Let's get the Krabby Patty formula and save Bikini Bottom.  Whoa. What is this place?
SpongeBob	Come on, push!
SpongeBob	Uh-oh!
SpongeBob	Hey guys. I smell Krabby Patties!  I think it's this way!  Now what?
SpongeBob	"What? ""Home of the Krabby Patty?"" But the Krusty Krab is the home of the Krabby Patty! Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?!"
SpongeBob	But how did you steal the formula?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	It's gonna be super-powered!
SpongeBob	Who wants 3,000 Krabby Patties?  First one's for you, Gary. Extra mayo, just the way you like it.
SpongeBob	See you later, te-am-mate!
SpongeBob	I have an idea!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, it's not tainted meat. It's painted meat!  Pretty Patties! Available in 6 designer colors.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, are you angry, too?
SpongeBob	I'm gonna open up a restaurant and sell Pretty Patties!
SpongeBob	I'm scared.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs was right! What am I going to do with all these?
SpongeBob	...shredding it...
SpongeBob	Who's #46,853?
SpongeBob	Yeah. Yeah! But do you know what I miss the most, Mr. Krabs? That tiny squeaking sound you get when you rub two pickles together. You know what I mean, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	What did you say, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Dreams do come true!
SpongeBob	Ta-da! A perfect patty.
SpongeBob	I am confident in my ability to successfully succeed.
SpongeBob	I...am a man!
SpongeBob	Haven't you ever had a very special friend?
SpongeBob	Pfft!
SpongeBob	Grandma, you make the best cookies in the deep blue sea.  Oh yeah...  Grandma's cookies...
SpongeBob	Thanks, Grandma!
SpongeBob	My forehead is funny?
SpongeBob	Stop it...!  I have been publicly humiliated for the last time!
SpongeBob	You're right, Patrick.
SpongeBob	I'm a grownup.
SpongeBob	All we need now is the icing on the maturity cake.  I've been growing these babies for years.
SpongeBob	I am? I mean, of course I am.
SpongeBob	So much for no more baby stuff.
SpongeBob	Poor Patrick. I almost feel sorry for you.  Trapped in the awkward phase of diaper days... never to know the rich rewards of being a grownup.
SpongeBob	Oh yeah, uh... great.  Nutritious.
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Alright, I guess I'll be going. I've, uh, got a lot of adult-type business to take care of, so, uh, I'll see yah later.
SpongeBob	I don't know when I'll be back.
SpongeBob	I don't?
SpongeBob	Wha?
SpongeBob	Who?
SpongeBob	Patrick, look. I got my...  I'm sorry, Patrick. [he wipes away a tear from his laugh.] It's just for a second I thought...
SpongeBob	We're playing with our new reef blowers!
SpongeBob	Squidward, you're steaming! You're like a steamed vegetable, only smarter.
SpongeBob	But you just ate three orders of fried oyster skins.
SpongeBob	Are you Squidward?
SpongeBob	Well, we know one thing: it sure isn't that guy!
SpongeBob	Sandy, I can't rake any faster.  These are big leaves.  And they keep breaking into more leaves.  Then go scrape the salt lick or somethin'! We got to get this stuff done before it's too late! What's the big rush anyway, Sandy?
SpongeBob	Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male.
SpongeBob	Climb!
SpongeBob	Wait Sandy!
SpongeBob	Life's as extreme as you want to make it!  Whoo!
SpongeBob	W-what h-happened to s-sleeping?
SpongeBob	Gee, that sounds safe! I mean, fun.  Ok, I'm ready! I thought you said we were riding through the park, Sandy!
SpongeBob	Not yet.
SpongeBob	You said it! Sandy'll never find us!  Hey wait, you don't understand!
SpongeBob	Sandy, you've got to make time! This is important!  I...am a man!  OK, Sandy, I...I...I...I...I can't play with you anymore! I just can't take the games! They're tearing me apart!  There, I said it! Now just promise we can still be friends. Please, Sandy? This isn't easy, I...
SpongeBob	"Like that barrel.  It says, ""Property of Salty Sea Farms""."
SpongeBob	Then, isn't that stealing?
SpongeBob	Even Mrs. Puff's hair curlers?
SpongeBob	I don't know. What do you want to do today?
SpongeBob	Yeah, like Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Yeah! then we can take a bike ride with the balloon. Then we can go to the movies and the arcade and the ice rink and the pizza shop!
SpongeBob	And under a hill!
SpongeBob	Hurry put the pieces on!  We popped the balloon!
SpongeBob	We have to confess.
SpongeBob	Take a last look Patrick. We can never go back.
SpongeBob	We can never go home, Pat. We're wanted men.  We'll spend the rest of our lives running...running, but at least it's warmer on the fire.
SpongeBob	"No more getting mail! (Originally ""No more getting nailed! Followed by Patrick nailing himself)  No more Gary!  No more movies!  No more Squidward!  No more Sandy or Pearl or Mr. Krabs!  No more anything!"
SpongeBob	Yeah! Maybe being a felon could be...  ...fun!  We can loosen our ties.
SpongeBob	And you get to talk tough!  This town ain't big enough for the two of us.
SpongeBob	Aw, Patrick...  you're the best bad influence ever!
SpongeBob	All we have to do is make them last for the rest of our lives!
SpongeBob	No, I didn't.
SpongeBob	Do you want it or what?
SpongeBob	Well, if you're going to be that way... I'll eat it myself.
SpongeBob	You're going to get in trouble.
SpongeBob	But...But...we stole a balloon.
SpongeBob	Today, I'm gonna sneak up and get that Sandy with a super sneaky karate move.
SpongeBob	Is she a friend from Texas?
SpongeBob	But the best part is you can write a letter to this guy, Santa Claus, and tell him what you want, and when he comes he brings it to you.
SpongeBob	Here you go, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Sure, buddy. Here you go. Okie dokie, Squid...  ...ward.
SpongeBob	Great, Mr. Krabs. What did you wish for?
SpongeBob	And what did you wish for, little girl?
SpongeBob	La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
SpongeBob	Right, too formal. Hi Santa...
SpongeBob	Cmon, Squid, all you have to do is write a letter. What have you got to lose?
SpongeBob	Cmon everybody! Let's sing till Santa gets here.
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	"A present. I made it for you so you wouldn't be left out when... Santa came! ""[cries some more]"""
SpongeBob	I better get this stuff off of Squid's house.
SpongeBob	C-c-could it be?
SpongeBob	S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...
SpongeBob	And what about that nose?  I knew you were suppose to have a big one but, that things gigantic.
SpongeBob	Go ahead, Santa Claus. See, he is real. He made my Christmas wish come true, he won't let you down.
SpongeBob	Sandy?  Hey Sandy, what's with the sign?
SpongeBob	What is this stuff?
SpongeBob	I guess you're right. It's okay here!
SpongeBob	I think this thing is Sandy.
SpongeBob	Hurry, we're getting in a taxi!
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Whew, we sure don't want to wake her up again. Too bad we don't have any earplugs to put on her.
SpongeBob	Hey Sandy, if you can't hear us, don't say anything!
SpongeBob	All right, Pinhead. Your time is up!
SpongeBob	I say I'm Dirty Dan!
SpongeBob	I'm Dirty Dan!
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Patrick, but the door is slippery! It's frozen shut!
SpongeBob	I'm so cold that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks!
SpongeBob	Maybe?
SpongeBob	Carefully...carefully?
SpongeBob	Pat, no!
SpongeBob	And this eyebrow/goatee combo works like a charm. This is the best idea we've ever had.
SpongeBob	Tartar sauce! The lock is still frozen!
SpongeBob	Oh, I've got ya now, Gary.
SpongeBob	OK,  Tag, you're it!
SpongeBob	Hey Patrick, have you seen Gary?
SpongeBob	OK, you two have a good time. I'll see you tomorrow.
SpongeBob	Come on, Gary! Try and catch meeee!  Isn't this great, Gary? Me running around and you chasing me?  You're not chasing me
SpongeBob	Fine, but I would like to remind him who it was who fed him and housed him and sat on his bedside when he was sick and massaged his eyestalks when his eyes were sore! OK, Gary, go ahead, show him. OK Gary, come to me! Come on, come on, Gary! Come on, come here, Gary!  Uh, wrong way Gary.  G-Gary, turn around! Gary, no, Gary, no, no, no! Don't do it, Gary!
SpongeBob	Oh, hello, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Soap? But we used to use soap.  Do you want 'Fresh Scent' or 'Heavy Du'
SpongeBob	No, Patrick. He wanted the cookie in your pocket!
SpongeBob	How many does that leave me with?
SpongeBob	OK, Mrs. Puff, what's my final score?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	What's extra credit?
SpongeBob	But I've learned so many things.
SpongeBob	A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils.  Gonna write an essay, that's what I say.  There.
SpongeBob	I can do this! I can do this!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	La la la la!
SpongeBob	What I learned in Boating School today is!
SpongeBob	Yes I do! I know that you're...a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray.  Somebody help me! Somebody help me!
SpongeBob	So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?
SpongeBob	I think I've got it! Wait a minute...
SpongeBob	Next time?
SpongeBob	Squid's back!
SpongeBob	We're gonna make this your best day ever!  Well, your best day's sure not gonna be out there.
SpongeBob	This is Jellyfish Fields, where wild jellyfish roam just waiting to be captured.  No, no, Squid! Over here! I know you're eager, but you don't even have your net. Pat, fix him up while I find him a good specimen.
SpongeBob	He's a natural!
SpongeBob	Be the net!
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick. Well...  Thought yesterday went...  pretty well, don't you think?
SpongeBob	Um, we're really sorry about what happened yesterday, Squidward.  Um, we got you a present!  It's the jellyfish.
SpongeBob	Cool! State-of-the-art jellyfish nets!
SpongeBob	Oh! Patrick, look! Can it be?
SpongeBob	Hi, Kevin.
SpongeBob	Hi, Kevin.
SpongeBob	Anything!
SpongeBob	Uh... here we are, Jellyfish Fields. Ohh...
SpongeBob	Oh, Uh, Let's see, one, two, three?
SpongeBob	Am I in the Jellyspotters now?
SpongeBob	Now?
SpongeBob	Now?  Now?  Now?
SpongeBob	This is fantastic! I've never been bait before! I don't think I've ever seen a queen jellyfish either.
SpongeBob	This is great! When I pass this test, I'll be an official jellyfish spotter!  Hey Kevin, I don't think it's working. Nothing?  Hey, hey Kevin! She's here! Look, she's here! She's here, Kevin! She's here?  Please don't be angry, your highness! I would have let you go!  Kevin!
SpongeBob	I am not a loser!
SpongeBob	Everybody loves pie!
SpongeBob	Yeah, but I turned them down. It's not about Kevin, it's about jellyfish!
SpongeBob	What about the Orb of Confusion?
SpongeBob	Looks like he's frozen or something.
SpongeBob	He said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain!
SpongeBob	Because you're evil!
SpongeBob	Really, really?
SpongeBob	Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode #17.
SpongeBob	We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go.
SpongeBob	Alright, goodness lesson number three.  Uhh, let's see.
SpongeBob	No, you let go!
SpongeBob	Rehabilitated.
SpongeBob	Forget about your skin, Patrick. Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him. This is a job for Mermaid Man...
SpongeBob	You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle boy.
SpongeBob	Bye, Man Ray! Wow. We did it! Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. We saved the day. Isn't it incredible, Patrick! Patrick?
SpongeBob	Hey, hey, hey ladies and jellyfish, have you ever noticed salt shakers? I mean, you fill them up every night at closing, and I mean, where does it all go? Huh? You know what I mean?
SpongeBob	Did you ever notice how, uhh...  ...forks, uhh...
SpongeBob	And they smell! But hey, you'd stink too if you spent three months buried in dirt.  Hey, why does it take more than one squirrel to change a light bulb?
SpongeBob	At least I don't have to clean up my act!
SpongeBob	Come on Sandy, I was just joking. I mean, everybody knows that you're the smartest one in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	Oh, hi, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Other jokes?  Bah! I got a million of them.
SpongeBob	Uhh, hey, what about this thing!  Huh? Huh?
SpongeBob	My people!  But seriously folks, I want to give a special thanks to my friend, Sandy.  Sandy, don't you see? The crowd loves these jokes.  Am I right?  Don't you see, Sandy? We're laughing with you, not at you! Do you understand now, Sandy? Huh, do you?
SpongeBob	Sandy, are you feeling alright?
SpongeBob	Sandy, I need wa...
SpongeBob	Sandy! Water!
SpongeBob	Ok Sandy, Ok! I get it!  No more squirrel jokes.  Thank you, thank you very much. Well, on my way over here, I ran into a squirrel.  And I said, 'Hey, why don't you go get a couple of squirrel friends and we'll go change a light bulb.'  But seriously folks, the only thing dumber than a squirrel is a sponge!  I mean, we're so dumb, we don't even have a vertebrae!  Look at me! I got no bones!
SpongeBob	Yup, and just relax.
SpongeBob	They sure do.
SpongeBob	That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest.
SpongeBob	Ahh!  Hey, no fair, Sandy! You got a head start!
SpongeBob	I didn't!
SpongeBob	I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there!  -halfway there!-halfway there!.
SpongeBob	I guess I don't, air breather!
SpongeBob	Take that back! You-  not wet person!
SpongeBob	I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel.  But you're still just a land creature.
SpongeBob	Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if wasn't for that suit, you couldn't live down here!
SpongeBob	Remember this?
SpongeBob	Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it.  There. Mission accomplished.
SpongeBob	We're sea creatures!
SpongeBob	All right, Pat, you made it! Come on, Mr. Krabs! Up here!
SpongeBob	Well, here we are. []
SpongeBob	Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy.
SpongeBob	He spits a giant pearl 100 feet in the air! Like a cannonball!
SpongeBob	Hey Patrick, it's waking up!
SpongeBob	Right.
SpongeBob	No Gary, how would I know anything about the oyster?
SpongeBob	Funny thing you should mention that old oyster, because I... uh... was kind of wondering, um... Let's say I know this guy who may have something to do with the oyster.
SpongeBob	Well, um... I... uh... no.  Squidward?
SpongeBob	I better go see Sandy! She'll know what to do!
SpongeBob	Okay, good luck with all that Patrick, and, um, I guess I'll see you later!
SpongeBob	Y-yes!
SpongeBob	Yes! Yes! It's true! It's all true! The merriment, the peanut, the Patrick!
SpongeBob	Wait! Hold your peanuts! Patrick Star is innocent! I have come here to reveal the truth! They say that truth and honesty will be rewarded with trust and forgiveness...
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	I know! What do you think we should name it?
SpongeBob	Squid, wait! Wait!
SpongeBob	I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.
SpongeBob	I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell?
SpongeBob	That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!
SpongeBob	No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship.
SpongeBob	Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
SpongeBob	Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
SpongeBob	Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Captain, we'll buff out those scratches.
SpongeBob	Like movie passes?
SpongeBob	But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department.
SpongeBob	Never!
SpongeBob	Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this!
SpongeBob	That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.
SpongeBob	Come on, mister, let us out! Don't be so mean! Don't be so fatty!
SpongeBob	And what did you say your name was?
SpongeBob	We're home!
SpongeBob	Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath!...  ...Please...  ... I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages.
SpongeBob	"I don't know what a snail would want with a brooch! Now why don't you just get into the tub?!  Get in the tub!  Get in the tub!!  Get in the tub...  In the tub.  In the tub!  Now, Gary, are you gonna get in this tub or am I gonna have to... [pulls up Gary off the floor but both end up dangling from the ceiling] Gary, could you...  Gary, no! [Gary pulls in other eye] Gary! . Alright, Gary, you have duped, and/or, frustrated me for the last time. So, if I can't get you to come to the bath, I'll just have to bring the bath to you. . Psst, Gary. Bath delivery. . Come back, Gary. I have something to ""chair"" with you.  ""Dishes"" more like it. ""Water"" you waiting for, Gary?"
SpongeBob	It may be a free country, but you live in my house under my rules.
SpongeBob	Who're you playing cards with, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Taking him to the cleaners, that a hot one!  How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!
SpongeBob	Go on, Mr. Krabs. Tell him. Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	The sign says kitchen, but my heart says Jail. A stove is a stove, no matter where you go.
SpongeBob	It's just a greasy spoon...
SpongeBob	Well, I usually cook on a grill.
SpongeBob	Move it over a little more.
SpongeBob	It is an exact replica! Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing! One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr. Krabs!  Oh...Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Wait till I finish my ice cream!
SpongeBob	Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos.
SpongeBob	[crossing his arms in refusal] No!
SpongeBob	I don't feel like it! Why don't you ask me later, crabby?  I mean...I'll work all day for free! My treat!
SpongeBob	three! Patrick, how come you always do paper?
SpongeBob	Stand back, Patrick! I can't draw with you breathing down my neck!
SpongeBob	Now that's more like it, Mr. Critic!
SpongeBob	Coming right up!
SpongeBob	It's kind of creepy looking when it moves.
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Squidward's answering the door and...
SpongeBob	Come on, let's go!
SpongeBob	No way. I created this monster and I've got to stop him.
SpongeBob	There he is.
SpongeBob	Patrick! Patrick! Do something!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, what was that?
SpongeBob	Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, goodnight, sweet prince.
SpongeBob	Or maybe it was most clumsy.  Huh?  Paper!  Page for Mr. Doodle!
SpongeBob	Exactly! See how happy he is?
SpongeBob	Here's your net.  Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves.
SpongeBob	I've got a gazillion secrets!
SpongeBob	Uhh... Let's see...  Did you know that you're my best friend?
SpongeBob	Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?
SpongeBob	Come on, Patrick, just a peek?
SpongeBob	What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish!  Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds.  Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victim's severed heads in a box.  Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party!  I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do!  That's it! How do you look in a secret box?  Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back.  Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary?
SpongeBob	Shhh!
SpongeBob	Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop! It's me, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that!  Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow!
SpongeBob	Next, les ingredients.  Ah, oui!  Les mustard.
SpongeBob	I swear I'm not doing anything. Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted!
SpongeBob	Plankton? What do you want?
SpongeBob	I... guess so.
SpongeBob	You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow.
SpongeBob	Morning already?  I... I feel a little funny today.
SpongeBob	Something must be wrong with my brain!  Plankton!  What kind of friend are you?
SpongeBob	No, no, no!  There's no one here.
SpongeBob	With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness.
SpongeBob	Is this the part where we start kicking?
SpongeBob	And Larry, when your heart gave out from all those tanning pills, who revived you?
SpongeBob	We're ready to perform, Squidward.
SpongeBob	The winner takes all, it's the thrill of one more kill. The last one to fall will never sacrifice their will. Don't ever look back on the world closin' in. Be on the attack with your wings on the wind. Oh, the games will begin.  And it's sweet, sweet, sweet victory, yeah. And it's ours for the taking, it's ours for the fight,  And it's sweet, sweet, sweet victory, yeah. And the one who's last to fall. We will have sweet, sweet victory...
SpongeBob	Good! 'Cause we've got customers!
SpongeBob	All right!  Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash...at night.  You mean outside?
SpongeBob	Pfft, nah.
SpongeBob	What happened, what happened, what happened!?
SpongeBob	Tell me the story!
SpongeBob	Irregular portions?
SpongeBob	Oh, no!
SpongeBob	How will we know?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	It's not?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	"""The phone will ring and there will be no one there.""  Oh, you crack me up."
SpongeBob	The Hash-Slinging Slasher!
SpongeBob	Do you have references?
SpongeBob	Hey, that's my driving teacher, Mrs. Puff!
SpongeBob	Hey, I know! Why don't I take you over and introduce you?
SpongeBob	Wait, Mrs. Puff! We're not driving.
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff, I'd like to introduce you to Mr...
SpongeBob	No, no, Mr. Krabs, just say hello.
SpongeBob	Try to guess your weight!
SpongeBob	Are you ready for your date, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Giant rusty anchor?
SpongeBob	I don't understand, Mr. Krabs. How can you spend $100,000 in one night?
SpongeBob	I don't get it, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I got the flowers you wanted me to buy.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, the budget doesn't allow for...
SpongeBob	Well, I think she...
SpongeBob	One shady hat.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, don't. Don't cry, Mr. Krabs! Come on. Ok, I, I'm going to get it, see?  Cheer up, Mr. Krabs! Here's that washing machine you wanted!
SpongeBob	Did you hear that? We get an assignment!
SpongeBob	OK Gary, no goofing off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is  the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm.. funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink.  Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay.  OK, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Spotlight. Hey this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go!  Gee, this is harder than I thought...
SpongeBob	What do you mean you're not hungry?
SpongeBob	That's really fascinating, are you having a good sleep? Any dreams you'd like to discuss, I remember on the...
SpongeBob	Yeah, well I gotta get going Patrick, got an important essay to write?  Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy?  I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! Now they're floating around my thinking space.  So long Pesky Particles!  I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water!  That was a close one.
SpongeBob	Great thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail?
SpongeBob	How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay?
SpongeBob	You get up here! I've got to get back to work!
SpongeBob	Where's my essay! Oh, there you are!  I must have dozed off.  Lets see where are we?  Do I dare look at the clock..?  It's almost 9 o' clock! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes? How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight?? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight!  And making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep...  Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is!  Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody?
SpongeBob	Patrick, what's with the home improvement?  Hey, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Patrick! You forgot how to eat again! Come on, we'll get the funnel.
SpongeBob	You're right!
SpongeBob	Patrick, if your parents think you're dumb, then they must not know what dumb really is.
SpongeBob	Protective helmet, check.
SpongeBob	Hi.
SpongeBob	Hi.
SpongeBob	Patrick, could you let up on the insults just a little bit?
SpongeBob	Ok, I will!
SpongeBob	Now, listen to me! I'm not dumb! I have a brain! See, here's a picture of it!
SpongeBob	Well, see you in the A.M., Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	"Hmm...dumpster writing! The voice of the people! ""Up with bubbles, down with air!""  ""Nematodes are people too!""  Ha, those Nematodes... Here's one someone didn't finish! Squidward smells.  Good.  Hmm, what's this one? Krabs is a... hmm? Krabs is a ."
SpongeBob	Nah-uh, not that word, that word.
SpongeBob	How  right you are, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Hello, customers, nice  day we're having, uh?
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers.
SpongeBob	Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word!
SpongeBob	Darn.
SpongeBob	Escalators, escalators, escalators!!  Ha! Escalators!
SpongeBob	No wait, Patrick!  Patrick, no, please don't tell!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things.
SpongeBob	...number thirteen...
SpongeBob	Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr.Krabs.
SpongeBob	Mama Krabs, he said  and then he said  again and said  and then he screamed at the top of his voice ! And he----Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of  I have never heard in my days!
SpongeBob	You are the teacher? To my pupil? This isn't art class, it's Heaven.
SpongeBob	I have no talent.
SpongeBob	How's this, Squidward?
SpongeBob	I call it: Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped of paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time.
SpongeBob	Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons.  I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence.  I don't even deserve to use your doors!
SpongeBob	Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame.  These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy. I can't look at them.
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	I... can't!
SpongeBob	That's not in the book, either.
SpongeBob	I've gotta embrace the marble!
SpongeBob	I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble!  I've gotta be the marble! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within.
SpongeBob	"La la la la, la la la la la!  You're my twelfth catch of the day. I'm gonna call you ""Twelvey.""  Coochie coochie coo!  Bye, Twelvey!  Oh! It's you!  Well it's just you and me again, I've caught and named every jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields at least once. Except you, No Name."
SpongeBob	Wow! One more minute than yesterday! SpongeBob ready for lunch!   Yum!
SpongeBob	Sure!
SpongeBob	Oh boy. Getting paid to jellyfish. That's my life's dream!
SpongeBob	No! Never!
SpongeBob	More jellies, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	I'm not interested in anything you're selling!  I sure felt like...  I must be working too hard.  I'll get it, Gary! Hello, SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob speaking. Hello?
SpongeBob	What kind of monster is responsible for this horror?
SpongeBob	Something that should've been done a long time ago!
SpongeBob	Freedom! Freedom!
SpongeBob	This is perhaps the greatest day of my young life, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Come on, Patrick, I'm trying to train for the games.
SpongeBob	What do you mean easy?
SpongeBob	Why don't you go home Patrick? You can compete in the Laying Under a Rock All Day Games!
SpongeBob	How can you hear it? You don't have ears either!
SpongeBob	Fine! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob	Not if I eat it first!
SpongeBob	What do you mean?
SpongeBob	I'm angry!
SpongeBob	I scream for ice cream!
SpongeBob	I don't like you!
SpongeBob	Yellow?
SpongeBob	Over and under, grab the end, put it through here, up and around, round the horn, bring it back home.
SpongeBob	I'm just giving Mr. Krabs the money I owe him.
SpongeBob	Right!
SpongeBob	Yay! A strike!
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	Yeah!  Noo...
SpongeBob	And more?
SpongeBob	How's this?
SpongeBob	Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression!
SpongeBob	Anything for an aspiring fry cook.  So, did you come down to help out the cause?
SpongeBob	Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing.
SpongeBob	Yeah, that too!
SpongeBob	Gee, being on strike with Squidward sure is a kick. Squidward's words are still buzzing around in my head like an angry jellyfish. Squidward was right! I can't just sit here, it's time for action!  I will restore the working man to his rightful glory. I will dismantle this oppressive establishment board by board!  I will saw the tables of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of big business!  Squidward will be so proud!
SpongeBob	Ya-hoo! The strike worked, Squidward! We got our jobs back! Forever!
SpongeBob	Patrick, what are you talking about?
SpongeBob	Well, you're a bigger one!
SpongeBob	Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary?  Gary?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squidward! I'm coming!
SpongeBob	...
SpongeBob	Squidward...
SpongeBob	What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy?  Oh, ho-ho, so this is what I find, huh? My best friend and my ex-best friend and...  ...rubber bath toys!
SpongeBob	Where'd ya go, friend?
SpongeBob	Yes, please!  Thanks, friend.
SpongeBob	There ya go. More please!
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Guess what, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Trick-or-treat. Thank you.  You keep the change.  What?  I saw it! It was big! It was all wiggly! And it ate everything!
SpongeBob	But Sandy, you don't know!
SpongeBob	Sandy, don't go!
SpongeBob	Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail?
SpongeBob	No, it's not. This is your tail.
SpongeBob	You know, tails are so overrated. Let's just forget about it and go home.  I've got ice cream! With nuts...  Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm! Y'all come back here, young lady!
SpongeBob	You are.
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	You see...
SpongeBob	Sandy, that's not...!
SpongeBob	Sandy...?
SpongeBob	So what's the plan, Sandy?
SpongeBob	I wanna hear you say it!
SpongeBob	Say it!
SpongeBob	Uh, Sandy?
SpongeBob	Yay! He'll never get out of there!
SpongeBob	There you are sir. Two deluxe...  Ahoy there, Mr. Plankton.
SpongeBob	Because that Patty is for the customer, sir!
SpongeBob	Oh yes, please sir, please!
SpongeBob	But sir, there's gotta be something I need to improve on. Anything!
SpongeBob	Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...
SpongeBob	Register!
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward, I can see you through this little window!
SpongeBob	No sir, he's back.
SpongeBob	He's the most hated creature in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	I'm gonna make you eat those words, Krabs!  No shoes, no shirt, no service!
SpongeBob	Phone call, Mr. Plankton.
SpongeBob	Uhh, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard.
SpongeBob	Lifeguard?
SpongeBob	(high voice) I'd love it!
SpongeBob	By myself?
SpongeBob	But I...  ...can't swim. Oh, if I'd known being a lifeguard meant guarding their lives, I would never have said yes.  Maybe nothing will go wrong. Then when Larry comes back, I'll tell him I'm not interested. Besides, whats the worst that could happen?  Emergency! Everybody out of the water! Hurry! Emergency! Out of the water!  Emergency!  Uhh... there are sharks in there!
SpongeBob	Does Larry ever give you  free ice cream?
SpongeBob	Somebody would be screaming that they're drowning.
SpongeBob	Hold on, Patrick!  I'm coming!
SpongeBob	Sorry. Here's your hot dog.  Ok, Patrick, here I come.  Come, come round, Pat. Here I am.
SpongeBob	No, Larry.
SpongeBob	We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club.
SpongeBob	We've been stuck up here for three days.
SpongeBob	No, it's not, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married?
SpongeBob	It's a gift from the Magic Conch.
SpongeBob	Why don't you ask... the Magic Conch, Squidward?
SpongeBob	I'd better call the doctor, 'cause I've got spring fever! Good morning, little flowers.  Hello Squidward, isn't it a lovely day?
SpongeBob	Hi Patrick!  How does this keep happening?  Hi.  She's beautiful!  What a magnificent seahorse. I shall tame her. Who knows what we can accomplish?  Because of her mysterious behavior, I have decided to name her Mystery. Hmmm, now that I think of it, she is very graceful and majestic. Perhaps I should name her Grace, or Majesty, or Debbie.  She must have spotted my floral bookmark!  She's coming this way. That's it girl. Don't be afraid. I'm just a talking sponge, is all.  Gosh, Mystery, that was the greatest day of my life. Do you think we'll be friends forever?  I'll take that as a yes!
SpongeBob	That's not a monster Mr. Krabs, it's a horse. She's my friend. Her name is Mystery.
SpongeBob	You're welcome, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	No, Mr. Krabs. I was just practicing my imitation of Mystery. Weesnaw.
SpongeBob	They vanished. Squidward, do you think the Krusty Krab is haunted? What if they come for me next? I gotta get out of here!
SpongeBob	Don't tell Mr. Krabs! I got it all under control!  Now then, you were saying?
SpongeBob	No, Mr. Krabs! Don't make me give up Mystery! I know you think she's just a horse, but she's more than that, I tell you. She listens to me. She understands everything I say and I understand her! She's my best friend!
SpongeBob	Alright, Mr. Krabs, I understand.
SpongeBob	"Like you don't know.  Saying,  ""I hate Krabby Patties.""  That's hilarious! Everyone loves Krabby Patties."
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Those words. Is it possible to use them in a sentence together like that?
SpongeBob	Sorry, Patrick.  Come on, you're gonna
SpongeBob	Come on, open wide!
SpongeBob	Okay, just half.
SpongeBob	Just smell it.
SpongeBob	You won't be sorry.
SpongeBob	But
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Coming right up!  Listen, Squidward. I want to apologize for before. I was only trying to make you happy.  But I guess deep down inside, I was trying to make myself happy, but now I've learned there's room for all kinds of people in this crazy old  ...and they all don't have to like the same things.
SpongeBob	Oh no, what's this doing here?! This patty should be cremated!  I know you didn't like him, but... it means so much that you came.
SpongeBob	And why is the patty vault open?
SpongeBob	You like Krabby Patties, don't you, Squidward?
SpongeBob	...and then you'll blow up!
SpongeBob	Wait, I got it! The quiz pencil goes right over here next to the essay pencil  and the essay pencil gets turned sideways toward the notepad,  just in case I have to write an essay.
SpongeBob	That time it almost seemed like...  ...you did mean it.  Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	I just don't understand. Why would Flats want to kick my butt? I haven't said two words to the guy!  Oh no, that's three! What am I going to do?  What was that? Someone's coming. They're getting closer. I've just got to act natural.
SpongeBob	...and I leave Gary's water bowl to Gary, and my curtains to... oh Neptune, I just can't do this.  Death row, next in line speaking.
SpongeBob	What? No, listen! I'm in big trouble. There's a new guy at school here and he wants to kick my butt! Listen, you're big and strong, do you think you could come down here and maybe rough him a bit? Just to get him off my back? Please, Patrick, I'm so scared, it feels like I'm gonna throw up.
SpongeBob	I can't tell you.
SpongeBob	Flats says he's going to kick my butt!
SpongeBob	You what?!
SpongeBob	Out of my way! Out of my way!  Can't you see he's gonna kick my butt?!
SpongeBob	Yeah. They said you'd be okay after the first few minutes, but I just wanted to be sure.
SpongeBob	Gary, there's something I want you to know, but I'm too scared to remember what it is.
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry.  The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe.
SpongeBob	Try the Krusty Kelp Dog, sir!
SpongeBob	And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal?
SpongeBob	Duped!
SpongeBob	It doesn't seem right...  ...but it feels so good!  Seahorse radish: the gnarliest stuff in the ocean.
SpongeBob	Here you go sir, enjoy.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?
SpongeBob	Eww, gross, germs, it's all icky and corpsy!
SpongeBob	Aye aye, sir!
SpongeBob	Shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf?
SpongeBob	Can I lose my cool now?
SpongeBob	Oh man, this is so gross!  The back door is locked. What am I gonna do?
SpongeBob	What? You can't pin this whole rap on me!
SpongeBob	It's the zombie!
SpongeBob	That's me!
SpongeBob	Easy... easy...
SpongeBob	With...  ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate!  Arrrrr! A football player! [stands in a football player stance] Hup!
SpongeBob	Let's go for it!  Gloves!
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, climb up there and secure this rope.
SpongeBob	Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! I think we should keep our voices down! We might start an avalanche!
SpongeBob	Hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way!
SpongeBob	What noise, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Squidward's such a jerk.
SpongeBob	But we don't!
SpongeBob	Okay, Squidward! Robot Pirate Island it is!
SpongeBob	For that you'll walk the plank!
SpongeBob	Listen to that, Gary. Squidward finally made the box work after all. That's so great.
SpongeBob	Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? Must...get... autograph!
SpongeBob	Hey guys! Wait up!  I've got something for you...
SpongeBob	I don't know.
SpongeBob	No, No!
SpongeBob	Please don't tell!
SpongeBob	Don't!
SpongeBob	I'm begging you!
SpongeBob	Uh...  Uh...
SpongeBob	Patrick, I was at work and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look.
SpongeBob	Patrick, no! That's not an action figure! That's the real Squidward! I shrunk him by accident.
SpongeBob	Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you.
SpongeBob	No! He can never find out! But I'll think of something. I promise. Until then,  you'll be safe in this jar.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry Sandy! Mermaid Man came in and...
SpongeBob	You don't understand!
SpongeBob	I've got it!  Ta-da!  Since I couldn't make you big, I made the city small!  And now, only one more thing to shrink. Cheese!
SpongeBob	No, I'm ready to pass my boating test.  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready...  I'm ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well, pal, I won't be needing you anymore.  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready!
SpongeBob	Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I'm going to pass my boating exam!
SpongeBob	Stern.
SpongeBob	Oh yeah, absolutely.
SpongeBob	Floor it?
SpongeBob	I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it thirty-seven times.
SpongeBob	What is it, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Okay, I'm at the closet.
SpongeBob	I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it thirty-seven...
SpongeBob	Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers.  Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head?
SpongeBob	Here you go, ma'am.
SpongeBob	It's okay, it's only the boat.
SpongeBob	Put it in drive?
SpongeBob	I think I'm cheating.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!
SpongeBob	Cheating!
SpongeBob	Cheater...!
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester.  It'll be great!  Only now I don't even have my bike.
SpongeBob	Gotta pass the test! Gotta pass!
SpongeBob	Hi, I'm SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob	Oh, that poor woman. And it's all my fault. Maybe if I go talk to Patrick, he can ease my guilt.
SpongeBob	Alright, give me the money!
SpongeBob	Oh.
SpongeBob	Look, Patrick, there she is!  Mrs. Puff, wait, it's us, SpongeBob and Patrick!
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob	He likes chili. Now quick, get in before someone sees.
SpongeBob	But why?
SpongeBob	Quick, Mrs. Puff, hop on!
SpongeBob	Made of sponge!
SpongeBob	Oh, really, Patrick?  Did the snowball look like this?
SpongeBob	Sure, pal.
SpongeBob	Squidward! You're just in time to enlist in my army! Join me, and together we'll defeat the Pink Menace!
SpongeBob	Score one for the boys back home!
SpongeBob	I'm ready!
SpongeBob	Squidward, that wasn't the peace treaty. That was a copy of the peace treaty.
SpongeBob	Argh! It's true, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!
SpongeBob	He's right, Squidward. That thing would never protect you. It's downright puny.
SpongeBob	Squidward returned fire!
SpongeBob	Did you hear something, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Wow! Look at this neat-o soda-drinking hat. Oh! It must've belonged to someone who was number 1. There's only been a handful of number ones in the history of forever.
SpongeBob	Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you for bringing us together!  How can I ever repay you?
SpongeBob	Thanks, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Am I a pretty girl?
SpongeBob	Yep.
SpongeBob	Nope.
SpongeBob	Ooh...
SpongeBob	How do you know my name? Who are you?!
SpongeBob	Smitty what?
SpongeBob	To its owner?
SpongeBob	I was just returning the cursed soda-drink hat to its original owner: Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen.
SpongeBob	Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets.
SpongeBob	Let's give Mr. Krabs a big hand.
SpongeBob	Me? In the Krusty Krab commercial? Me!
SpongeBob	Look, Gary! It's on!
SpongeBob	That was the best 60 seconds of my life! Well, time for bed.
SpongeBob	You did?
SpongeBob	Oh, please excuse me, sir.
SpongeBob	Why, of course, good sir. And next time, feel free to approach me. It most be so degrading to ask across the room. And who am I making this bad boy out to?
SpongeBob	Yes, I am that guy on TV.
SpongeBob	Yes, pilot.
SpongeBob	They are, Mr. Krabs, and so is mine. And now I gotta lay something on ya, Krabs Baby.
SpongeBob	I knew you'd understand. Well, thanks for the start. I'm out of here.
SpongeBob	How you doing, folks?
SpongeBob	Juggling! Thanks, Squiddy.
SpongeBob	Uh, okay. There's a nun, an astronaut, and a hairdryer.
SpongeBob	They seem to like it when I put this patty on the grill. I may be able to save this act, yet. Roll with it, SpongeBob. Roll with it. There's more where that came from, folks.
SpongeBob	I'm breaking new ground. Time to get edgy.
SpongeBob	1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3...
SpongeBob	No!  Whew.
SpongeBob	I never knew you felt so strongly about it.
SpongeBob	Anyways, I just want you to know, if you ever get in trouble come find me. I'll take care of you. 'Cause you and me...  ...we're like brothers, only closer.
SpongeBob	It's me, SpongeBob.  We used to work together.
SpongeBob	A spaceman?
SpongeBob	There, there. You can come live with me.  Here you go, Squidward. You can sleep in my bed.
SpongeBob	It's no trouble. Is there anything else I can do for you, Winner?
SpongeBob	Here you go.
SpongeBob	He's just having a hard time getting his confidence back.
SpongeBob	Coming Squidward!
SpongeBob	What about it?
SpongeBob	Two things that won't work!
SpongeBob	Ya know, when you swatted that newspaper out of my hands, it reminded me of something a friend of mine did...at his job!
SpongeBob	You want your dime back?!  Take it! Now Squidward can come back right?
SpongeBob	This is a dime?
SpongeBob	Oh, I'll be changing alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah!  Hi-yah!  Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah!
SpongeBob	I may be down, but I'm not out!
SpongeBob	Ew.
SpongeBob	How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup?
SpongeBob	Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong at Weenie Hut Jr's?
SpongeBob	What? But I'm not a weenie!
SpongeBob	So, your name's Reg?
SpongeBob	I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order.  So, uhh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate?
SpongeBob	I am not a weenie!
SpongeBob	I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only one of getting into the Salty Spitoon.
SpongeBob	Afternoon, Reg.
SpongeBob	Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny.
SpongeBob	I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby!
SpongeBob	Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life!  Sandy?  What happened?
SpongeBob	What can I do?
SpongeBob	"""How To Become a Fancy Waiter in Less Than 20 Minutes."" Don't worry Squidward, I'll memorize every page, right down to the punctuation marks!"
SpongeBob	Empty my mind?
SpongeBob	It was easy, once I cleared my mind.
SpongeBob	If you need anything else, just call.
SpongeBob	Uhh... Beef Wellington?
SpongeBob	More soup for your armpit?
SpongeBob	Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on.
SpongeBob	Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep.  Robot! Oh my gosh!  Huh?
SpongeBob	#17 --  Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh?
SpongeBob	That sounds like Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too.
SpongeBob	Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward?
SpongeBob	Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad?
SpongeBob	Hey, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy!
SpongeBob	Sorry.
SpongeBob	I can't take it!
SpongeBob	Right.
SpongeBob	This is one stubborn robot.
SpongeBob	I guess it didn't know anything.
SpongeBob	Uh, at least he's not laughing.
SpongeBob	Oh, hey, Patrick.  Well, I'd better get going!
SpongeBob	It's a baby scallop.
SpongeBob	You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple.  Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in.  There you go. It's the best seat in the house.
SpongeBob	Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	All we have left is this apple!
SpongeBob	I don't know. Aww, don't cry.
SpongeBob	Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.
SpongeBob	Yeah.  Shh!
SpongeBob	Good night, Patrick.  Patrick, breakfast is ready!
SpongeBob	Going? Where are you going?
SpongeBob	Oh great, you're home! Now you can help me with the baby.
SpongeBob	Uhh, ok, tomorrow.
SpongeBob	Patrick?
SpongeBob	Don't 'one more minute' me, Mr. Man!
SpongeBob	Hmmm?
SpongeBob	So, what's the plan for the day?
SpongeBob	Six o'clock.
SpongeBob	Do you remember what you said to me this morning?
SpongeBob	What? Where do you think you're going?
SpongeBob	Oh, you poor, poor thing! By the way, you forgot your !
SpongeBob	And that's the kind of work you're doing?
SpongeBob	Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window.
SpongeBob	Goodbye.
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward, check this out.  Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become...
SpongeBob	Patrick?
SpongeBob	Ok, we'll just paint around all this stuff.
SpongeBob	And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off.
SpongeBob	Ok, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready.  Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush.  All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go.
SpongeBob	No problem. Here I go.  Yeah! Huh?  Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble!?
SpongeBob	Pat, no!  We did it! We painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the--   Flappin' Flotsam! What's that?!  We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?
SpongeBob	This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar
SpongeBob	Did it work?
SpongeBob	It didn't work.
SpongeBob	Ok, ok, we still have time!  Don't panic SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome!
SpongeBob	Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going
SpongeBob	Hi, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Why don't ya scram you little freeloader?  Hmph! Bottomfeeder!
SpongeBob	Don't you think you've had enough? All you're missing is a bowl of butter!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Krabs. I'm busy! Unless you're paying me overtime.
SpongeBob	...so beat it tubby, I don't care for your company!
SpongeBob	OVERTIME!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	Hey, what are you doing you crazy bushy-tailed rodent?! Hey!
SpongeBob	You know what I don't understand though?
SpongeBob	Well, Squidward. I've only been studying a couple of years. But if total karate knowledge is what you seek...
SpongeBob	I know!
SpongeBob	Hi Pearl! Looks like you and I get to spend some quality time together!
SpongeBob	Yeah. That's exactly right, Gare-bear. I can't go to work today. The Krusty Krab is closed on Sundays. Gee, Gary, I was really looking forward to work. Now what purpose could today possibly have? Yeah, Mr. Krabs, did you me to come into work today? Oh. Hi, Sandy. Yeah... No... No, just me and Gary... No. I don't know yet... No, I'm not sick... You... need... a house-sitter?! Today?!
SpongeBob	Oh.
SpongeBob	That stands to reason.
SpongeBob	Trust me, Sandy. You've got nothing to worry about. Your beloved treedome is in my capable hands.
SpongeBob	Normal.  2,692... 2,693... 2,694...  Sandy said this collection of rare fragile artifacts needs to be gently cleaned twice daily. There we go. Not a speck of dust anywhere. Wait a minute.  Aha! There... we go. Worm incubator. Well, looks like everything's fine here. What the...?  Ohhh!! Sandy said these wouldn't hatch for... ...weeks! What is going on?! Oh! Patrick?
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah, thanks for reminding me. I almost for...P-P-P-Patrick! Help me! I-I can't b-b-b-breathe!
SpongeBob	Well, Lucky Larry's sounds fun.
SpongeBob	Don't you think that working at the Chum Bucket the Krusty Krab is a conflict of interest, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Patrick and I are gonna see
SpongeBob	Uh, hold on, I'll take a peek
SpongeBob	Aww, the movie's over.
SpongeBob	D'ohhhh!
SpongeBob	It's okay, we'll just see the next one.
SpongeBob	Oh, it's just Slasher McGee. Okay, I guess I'll just go home now. It's right over there. Just a few steps that away. In the dark? All alone?
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah. Here. [gives Squidward's nightcap back. Squidward pulls SpongeBob's legs, which shoots him through his mail slot and into his bed]
SpongeBob	Not Gary. Think it'll hold?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squidward. We'll get you out of that old monster. Let's get to the window. (Patrick throws heavy objects onto Squidward) Okay! I think you got it! (Sirens) (Squidward grumbles) There, there, no need to digest. We're only doing what friends to for the bestest buddy. We don't have to be afraid of that old monster anymore.
SpongeBob	Gee, Kenny, I sure am sorry if I ruined your career.
SpongeBob	Come back! Fulfill your destiny! Patrick! Stop that pickle! Weird. I didn't even know Patrick owned a pogo stick.
SpongeBob	Not yet. No! Don't pop the bubble bike! By the way you're doing great for your first day. Hey look, there's Patrick. He's going into the Chum Bucket!
SpongeBob	Am I seeing double? What's going on here?
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	Come on little fella.That's right. Complete!
SpongeBob	Well that was 'pickle-culiar'.
SpongeBob	Wow.
SpongeBob	See ya later, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Yay!
SpongeBob	It's the police!
SpongeBob	Hooray, we're spy buddies!  Spy buddies.
SpongeBob	...and explosive diarrhea.
SpongeBob	We did it!
SpongeBob	Deal.
SpongeBob	Raah!  Help! Help! Help!
SpongeBob	Ew!  He inked!
SpongeBob	We don't know.
SpongeBob	You're welcome!
SpongeBob	Jellyfishing make me feel all right!
SpongeBob	That was fun.
SpongeBob	Squidward! Squidward!  Squidward!  Squidward! Oh, Squidward!  Squidward!
SpongeBob	You are, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Ahh, whew.
SpongeBob	Ahhhhh...  ahh...  ah...
SpongeBob	Ugh!
SpongeBob	We sure are excited!
SpongeBob	Your welcome!
SpongeBob	We promise Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah. You're a Goofy Goober, yeah. We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah. Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah!
SpongeBob	Help! Help us! We're drowning!
SpongeBob	WHOOOOOOOOOAAAAH!

SpongeBob	Oooohhhh!
SpongeBob	The Magic Conch! A club member!
SpongeBob	Yay!
SpongeBob	We're bad parents!
Squidward	Mr. Krabs!  Hurry, Mr. Krabs, before it's too late, I gotta tell you.
Squidward	What?
Squidward	One single file line was all I asked!
Squidward	But, but Mr. Krabs...
Squidward	Hooray. Mr. Krabs!
Squidward	Hurry up with those chairs, SpongeBob, it's after closing and I'd like to go home.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizza.  We don't deliver.
Squidward	Good, then you drive.
Squidward	Back it up.
Squidward	Shift into reverse, SpongeBob!
Squidward	Well... you backed up. And you know what? I think were out of gas. And you know what else?  We're in the middle of nowhere!
Squidward	...And my feet are killing me. Whoa.  SpongeBob? What are you doing?
Squidward	He's stopping! He's stopping!
Squidward	Well, I don't!
Squidward	SpongeBob! Let go of the pizza!
Squidward	That way? That way there?  So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way?
Squidward	Sponge, we gotta eat something.
Squidward	You're right. It's for the customer.
Squidward	No, I think I saw something.  Oh, no. I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine looking pizza.
Squidward	Oh, looks good, huh?
Squidward	Get back here, SpongeBob, give me the pizza!
Squidward	Wait!
Squidward	Will you cut that out?!
Squidward	Sponge? Sponge? It's okay. Sponge?  Sponge?
Squidward	Nah. Now take me home.
Squidward	Huh?  Oh!
Squidward	Fine. May I please take your order?
Squidward	Will that be for here or to go?
Squidward	This is lame.
Squidward	How should I know? Things people wanna buy!  Now keep your paws off my mail.
Squidward	Sir, will you please order already? You're holding up the line!
Squidward	I can think of three good reasons.
Squidward	Three!
Squidward	I like neither. Can I take your order?
Squidward	That'll be one dollar.
Squidward	A very dirty dollar?
Squidward	Ooh, ooh, ooh, Bikini Bottom Folk Village?
Squidward	How about you cast out over there so I can ignore you?
Squidward	Oh, please, he's such a drama queen. C'mon, Mr. Krabs, drop the act.  Mr. Krabs, it's just a stupid dollar.  For Pete's sake, Mr. Krabs, suck it up!  Mr. Krabs...  Mr. Krabs...  Okay, okay, Mr. Krabs, we'll help you get your dollar back!
Squidward	No. Uh-uh. No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore.
Squidward	Whatever. We've got plenty more to...  ...eat.
Squidward	Look again.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say...  you are completely out of your mind!  Get us out of here!
Squidward	Future!
Squidward	Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Squidward	No! Purebred means she is of the highest pedigree. See?  She even has her own papers. So if you'll excuse us, Snellie has to start her training.
Squidward	Papers.
Squidward	Patrick, that's a rock.
Squidward	I'll alert the paramedics.
Squidward	Come on, Snellie, it's all you, baby!
Squidward	I can't believe it. My purebred, which cost me $1,700, lost to a rock.
Squidward	Closing time. The happiest time of the day!
Squidward	What?  Placemats? Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad.
Squidward	Well, it was.
Squidward	Here's your mail, Eugene.
Squidward	"Uh... ""dream""?"
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?
Squidward	Is it time already for you to ruin my day?
Squidward	Yeah...
Squidward	Woah. Huh? Wha-what?
Squidward	Okay. Hmmm, yeah, sure.
Squidward	Good night, SpongeBob.   Good night, SpongeBob.  Tum-ta-dum! Today's the big day, Squidward! Don't wanna be late!  Gotta hurry! Hold it! Hold everything!  I would not want to miss this. The day SpongeBob moves! I can't believe it's really happening.
Squidward	Goodbye, SpongeBob, goodbye.  Goodbye, SpongeBob. Bye-bye-bye. Goodbye, SpongeBob. Ha-ha. Goodbye, goodbye.
Squidward	Stop naming moves after me!
Squidward	No! []
Squidward	Ahh, finally, the weekend is here. And this isn't just any old weekend.  This is the weekend that SpongeBob and Patrick go camping. Wouldn't it be great if they got lost in the woods and never came back?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Don't think I can't see what you're doing!
Squidward	That's it! I'm in! I'll show you camping!
Squidward	Huh? Voila!  But what could compare to just lying out under the stars?  Well, I've worked up an appetite as big as all outdoors. Time for a little grub. I suppose you two are gonna stew up some twigs and rocks, right?
Squidward	All right, all right, gimme a marshmallow.
Squidward	BETTER?! I was just fine until you lodged that ballistic junk food into my windpipe!
Squidward	"""I Married a Sea Bear""?"
Squidward	Okay. Then what?
Squidward	Sliced or cubed?
Squidward	And... and suddenly I have the sense we're all in danger.
Squidward	You guys are so gullible. See? I did everything that attracts a sea bear, and nothing happened. If sea bears really exist, why didn't one show up?
Squidward	Are you crazy? A dirt circle won't stop that monster. I'm running for my life!
Squidward	What'd I do that time?
Squidward	What attracts them?
Squidward	SpongeBob, take it easy! I'm sure you can get a new one.
Squidward	SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps.
Squidward	Hoorah.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, is this really the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty?
Squidward	...graine. Heh, heh, heh.
Squidward	Yes...
Squidward	That's the Tattletale Strangler.
Squidward	Ghosts!
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, can I go home yet?
Squidward	43...!
Squidward	SpongeBob.
Squidward	Why don't you go ask him yourself?
Squidward	Wow, this time I'm really late again. Maybe he'll finally fire me.  Locked?
Squidward	Harsh.
Squidward	What? You want me to spend my hard earned money on my richer than me skin flint boss? No, thank you.
Squidward	So I suggested we get you a new one.
Squidward	It was SpongeBob's fault. Getting Mr. Krabs a new mattress was his idea.
Squidward	Oh, that figures.
Squidward	Oh, I've got the most important job. I'm going to keep watch to make sure it's safe.
Squidward	What did you idiots do?
Squidward	No! In! Out.
Squidward	And my perfect plan falls into place.
Squidward	Come on, do it for old man Krabs.
Squidward	Now get in there!
Squidward	Yes.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, some guy in a suit wants to come in before we open.
Squidward	No, thanks, I'll pass.
Squidward	Did you see that, SpongeBob? I almost got that on my first try!
Squidward	Hmph, beginner's luck. Now it's the master's turn.
Squidward	Oh, I loosened that one up for you. You would've never won that without my skill.
Squidward	Oh, what the Alright. Let's get this over with.
Squidward	Because... I'm... all... out... of...
Squidward	A little mind-numbing television ought to help me forget about that stupid machine.  Yeeowwww!  You've had a rough day, Squiddie. But that doesn't mean tomorrow won't be better.  Oooh, phooey!!  I gotta win that crane!  Just once! Please, oh, please, let me win one time!
Squidward	SpongeBob, there's a secret?
Squidward	Yeah!
Squidward	SpongeBob! The secret?!
Squidward	This is ridiculous. If I close my eyes, how will I know where the...
Squidward	Okay, okay.
Squidward	Yuck it up all you want, Mr. Krabs. But just remember, you're yucking  in the presence of a winner!  Ha!
Squidward	You know what that means?
Squidward	I just closed my eyes and became the crane.
Squidward	Be the crane.
Squidward	Oh, my. Ohhh, my. Uhh... Time to go, Teddy.
Squidward	SpongeBob, what are you doing in my house?
Squidward	It's Sunday!  A good neighbor doesn't bother me on Sunday!
Squidward	Me? President of Bikini Bottom? I knew the people would come to their senses.
Squidward	Fine! As my first presidential decree, why don't you, uhh, go out and paint all the leaves on the trees to make the neighborhood look nicer?  Now out, out, out, out, out, out. That'll keep them busy for a few Sundays.
Squidward	What's going on out there?
Squidward	At least I still have my Sunday pedicure to look forward to.  What are you two doing in my house?
Squidward	Yes, it does!
Squidward	There are only 3 hours of my Sunday left. They took it all away. I didn't even get to read the Sunday paper.
Squidward	What the?!
Squidward	What's going on?
Squidward	No-no, don't say anything more. This was all my fault. I was the one who wanted to relax on Sunday. Now if you'll be so kind to leave so I can get ready for work tomorrow.
Squidward	Yes! Yes, I am.
Squidward	Please don't do that again.
Squidward	Can I start you off with...
Squidward	Sincere service  with a smile!
Squidward	Uhh, Eugene, I think you need to look at page 20 of our employee handbook again.
Squidward	Really, Mr. Krabs?
Squidward	It's not that funny.
Squidward	He's gone laughing tormentor.  This could be my chance.  SpongeBob, you don't look well!
Squidward	Tell me, SpongeBob, have your sides been hurting?
Squidward	SpongeBob, you've got to be careful! You're gonna burn out your laugh box.
Squidward	Well, the most important thing is to stop laughing. Any laugh at all could be dangerous.
Squidward	I really hate to see the little guy sad but not as much as I hate to see him happy.
Squidward	SpongeBob, there's no such thing as a laugh box! I made the whole thing up to get some peace from your insipid laughter!
Squidward	You even fell for the ol' thermometer in the boiling oil routine.
Squidward	Where am I?
Squidward	But, you cut out my laugh box.
Squidward	Artist?
Squidward	Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Squidward. May I take your order?
Squidward	Daring today, aren't we?  One Krabby Patty, extra onions.
Squidward	We're all out.
Squidward	I need a Krabby Patty.
Squidward	Hooray.
Squidward	Alright, alright. Time for another hideous day at work. Ahh, just hang in there, gorgeous.  Your star will shine at the clarinet recital tomorrow.
Squidward	I'm not sure what it is but I something seems different about me.
Squidward	Well, you have to do something. I can't stay stuck to him.
Squidward	Try anything! I cannot go to my clarinet recital like this.
Squidward	If you say so.
Squidward	SpongeBob, I need two Krabby Patties.
Squidward	Hello Molecular Separator Ray. Well, let's get on with it. My clarinet recital is tomorrow night.
Squidward	Of course.  Oh, my.  Where are you, Sandy? Sandy? I can't do it. I can't go out there.
Squidward	They... they... they're cheering. Superstardom. This must be what it feels like. This is what it looks like. What it [starts to laugh happily] sounds like. And...  ...what it smells like. Oh, simply intoxicating.
Squidward	It all started when I was born.
Squidward	SpongeBob, look!
Squidward	Boy, you reeled that one in like a pro.
Squidward	Gimme that! Now sign the register.
Squidward	How can you have bags?! You just found out this is a hotel!
Squidward	And bring him a Krabby Patty.
Squidward	What's in these bags, rocks?  Hey, these  rocks! Why is your suitcase full of rocks?
Squidward	What now?!
Squidward	Why don't you ask SpongeBob?
Squidward	But Mr. Krabs...
Squidward	Not anymore. I quit.
Squidward	I've got cash.
Squidward	The plaque.  Too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee.
Squidward	Oh,  not gonna eat this. You are.
Squidward	How should I know?! Ask my mother!
Squidward	"""We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request"".  Perfect!"
Squidward	Ha ha, are you crazy? I'm not going outside to swim!  Come on in, the water's fine.
Squidward	You're not gonna have a heart attack are you?
Squidward	Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ee! Ow! Ee! Ooh!
Squidward	What's going on?
Squidward	Ghosts?
Squidward	No! No! That's impossible!  Ghosts! Ghosts!
Squidward	I finished Pearl's portrait, Mr. Krabs. It's a true masterpiece.
Squidward	Oh yeah, I know all their songs.
Squidward	Hello, ladies.  When my tear ducts get issue, I can't use just any tissue... I need 4-ply, 4-Ply, 4-Ply, when I cry... Huh!
Squidward	Uhh, one monster Krabby Patty.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, get a load of SpongeBob.
Squidward	One monster Krabby Patty.
Squidward	Oh, this job stinks! But at least I'm not digging ditches.
Squidward	To be far away from you as possible. C'mon, SpongeBob, this hole's not gonna dig itself. And I'm certainly not gonna do it.
Squidward	That was the worst song I ever heard. But at least this stupid well's finished.
Squidward	Having fun down there, SpongeBob?
Squidward	There's no magic, SpongeBob. Wishing well's are just a scam to fool saps like you.
Squidward	There's not way to climb out of here.
Squidward	No, it doesn't.
Squidward	Eww. Patrick!
Squidward	Patrick, get off of me!  I told you I am claustrophobic!
Squidward	The only thing I wish for is to be far away from here.  Ow.
Squidward	What a sun-tastic day!  Snail trail.  That SpongeBob needs to keep his pet out of my yard. I am sick of cleaning up after him.
Squidward	Oh, but it's just like you, SpongeBob, to raise such a misbehaved mutt.
Squidward	For rabies?
Squidward	Rash?
Squidward	I'm a zombie, here to dine on your squishy yellow flesh.  It's locked!  Somebody let me in.
Squidward	Nor will I.
Squidward	I need 20 Krabby Patties, please.
Squidward	Who? What? Where? What? How?
Squidward	Umm...maybe.
Squidward	Hide your shame, SpongeBob. Hide your shame.
Squidward	Just look at yourself.
Squidward	Can't you see how ridiculous you look?
Squidward	It's called a reeeee! [When he says the last part, a note plays.]
Squidward	A submarine?
Squidward	Wonderful. Wait! If you're out here, then who's in here?
Squidward	So, how's it going?  I can't control my eyeballs!
Squidward	What's happening?
Squidward	Stop burping inside me! That's disgusting!
Squidward	Morons.
Squidward	He-  And who are you, my rubenesque beauty?
Squidward	Eh? Ya know, Patricia, they don't call me the 'Sizzle Lips Squid' for nothing.  So, are you free this Saturday night?
Squidward	But I made reservations for two at...
Squidward	Will you two be quiet?! I'm trying to watch public television.
Squidward	Not so fast. You two little monsters aren't about to ruin my evening.
Squidward	I'm going to go somewhere far away. Somewhere far away from those two watching public television on my TV. Pfah! They wouldn't know real culture even if it hit them like a truck full of cement.  Oh.  Day five, I think. I've been waddling these fields. I'm hungry, tired, and lost. The only good thing about this is no SpongeBob.  Jellyfish Fields.
Squidward	Magic? Can you make yourself disappear, SpongeBob?
Squidward	Ew.  What are you doing, SpongeBob?
Squidward	My-my-my house. What's happened to my...huh?  SpongeBob, Patrick.[explodes] What the barnacles is going on here?! Look at what you've done. Look at my poor front yard.
Squidward	You. Do you honestly believe that that mindless starfish can possibly be the king of anything?  King of Morons, maybe.
Squidward	What?
Squidward	I wouldn't let that thing into my house even if it was potty-trained!  I didn't need to see that.
Squidward	SpongeBob, listen to me, you square-headed assault on my ears, I've had enough of this!  Strawberry.  Two can play at this!
Squidward	Yes, SpongeBob?
Squidward	That's it.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	SpongeBob, you always over-react to everything. One of your many annoying traits.
Squidward	Panic! Run for your lives!  The Wild Ones are coming!
Squidward	Would you like a drink with that order?
Squidward	That's telling them.
Squidward	Ah, the blank canvas. Infinite possibilities. All of the colors of the known and unknown universe hiding on my palate. The artist approaches, ready to create.
Squidward	How 'bout a game of hang up?  Well, I guess this brings an end to my luxuriating.
Squidward	What are you doing, SpongeBob?
Squidward	Hello, Squidward.
Squidward	Oh, Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Woo-hoo-hoo!
Squidward	Fine then. Do my work for me.
Squidward	What? All right, all right! That's enough! My break is finished.
Squidward	What's the big deal? Those are all my moves!
Squidward	He stole my jokes. He stole my job. He stole my standing ovation! You little wooden friend. Stop stealing my life!
Squidward	A sequin suit?! That's what you're supposed to offer me! Why take a cheep knock off when you can have the original.
Squidward	The concert is ruined. My reed is shot.  See? I'm finished.
Squidward	Not bad.
Squidward	How long do we have to keep this up?
Squidward	Don't you find this a tad suspicious?
Squidward	Hurry up, SpongeBob!
Squidward	Look!!!
Squidward	Now I feel complete!
Squidward	Because when Jim leaves, I'll be stuck with you again!
Squidward	Yeah! Ha! I could lose my beautiful, flowing hair, too, but I'm not buying a wig yet.
Squidward	What are you two whimpering about?
Squidward	Oh, SpongeBob, there are no creepy creatures of the dark. It's all in your imagination.
Squidward	Just keep walking, Squiddy, don't make eye contact.  Ah, now to soothe my frayed nerves.  Alright, what's going on? Why are you two crying?
Squidward	Move to another neighborhood.
Squidward	Your skin, SpongeBob! What's wrong with your skin?
Squidward	Here's your change, sir.
Squidward	If SpongeBob were here, we'd be covered in the Ick!  Lunch is served!  Eat up, kids.
Squidward	It's not me, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward	No, Mr. Krabs, it's that time of the month.
Squidward	I'm not...  ...wearing a disguise.
Squidward	Ah! Can't see! D'oh!  Ow.
Squidward	How does SpongeBob know all these names?
Squidward	Keep looking, SpongeBob. keep on looking.  So, what's your name?
Squidward	Thanks, SpongeBob!  Let's see. Halbert, Norma, Isabelle, Gus, Chas, Pelar, Jess, Cara, Ivy, Harv, Mable, Mavis--  And your name isSuzie Fish, correct?
Squidward	Out of the way, loser.  Um, hello. My name is Squidward.  Uh, so, what's your name?
Squidward	I see he wants to play hard to get. So be it! I have ways of making the likes of him talk.  Uh, sir, you forgot your soda.
Squidward	Hey, look up in the sky! A giant meteor is hurtling towards Earth.
Squidward	Finally, the moment of truth! Say good-bye to anonymity, Mr.--
Squidward	His driver's license!  At last! At last! And your name is--  Mr. What Zit Tooya? What kind of ridiculous name is that?
Squidward	SpongeBob?
Squidward	What? In the brochure, it specifically gives away an ocean liner vacation.
Squidward	One Krabby Patty and Krabby Fries for table number four.
Squidward	Jammed again.
Squidward	SpongeBob living at the Krusty Krab? Wait a minute, if he's living here, that means he won't be living next to me. Oh.
Squidward	Right! And when I woke up in the morning...
Squidward	Socks and--  What the...? SpongeBob, why is your underwear in the cash register?
Squidward	The same person who knitted these napkin holders and embroidered the menu.
Squidward	"I'm so glad I don't eat ""here""  Oh, how cold does Krabs keep this place, anyway?  62? Oh, that cheapskate! I'm going to start it to a toasty 63.  Huh?"
Squidward	That's totally selfish!
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	There's icicles hanging from the ceiling!
Squidward	Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe.
Squidward	You buffoons wouldn't know artistic vision if it hit you over the head. Now, where's the paintbrush?  I'll show you what artistic vision is all about. Start with light brush strokes.
Squidward	Everyone's a critic.
Squidward	Those were all fabricated from The Chum Bucket walls.
Squidward	Uh yeah.
Squidward	SpongeBob, hand over the Krabby
Squidward	How should I know? Do I look like my idiot's keeper?
Squidward	What's that putrid odor?
Squidward	Beautiful, huh? How beautiful do you think this is?
Squidward	That's it, Mr. Krabs; I'm taking my vacation now.
Squidward	At 3:47 in the morning?
Squidward	Do you remember what I told you happens to my brain every time I see you?
Squidward	--for as long as time shall stand.
Squidward	Oh, of course. Come, have a seat. The picnic's about to start.
Squidward	No! You're going out this door, right now--
Squidward	Can I come?
Squidward	You were right, SpongeBob. Watching the sunrise together is much better.
Squidward	How are we today? Everything a-okay here?
Squidward	Yes, sir.
Squidward	Yes, sir.
Squidward	SpongeBob! Patrick! What are you two still doing here?
Squidward	Uh, no thanks, I got to go.
Squidward	Hey!
Squidward	Ah, but this gizmo is faster, and you won't pay it a dime.
Squidward	A really good try. But let's see how you do against my machine set on high.
Squidward	Let me know if I've won!
Squidward	Ha. The two of you? Don't make me laugh. Come here... see that? That's where the trophy's going.
Squidward	Do I know you?
Squidward	Humph, if those two nitwits made it then I'm a shoo-in.
Squidward	But, but, but, but, you don't understand. I already build a trophy case with the cutest little plaque. If I could just touch it...
Squidward	The audition? My trophy?  I mean, uh, uh, yeah, the audition.  Evidently, I'm such a great dancer that I've been banned from the competition for life.
Squidward	Ok. Show me what you got, Patrick.
Squidward	A one and a two, and...  Pli, jet, relev -  No, no, no. This will never work. You've got two left feet.
Squidward	Are you questioning my leadership.
Squidward	Oh, please. Just wait until you see my brilliant moves.
Squidward	Of course they have. They are in the presence of a true artiste.
Squidward	I'm in pain!
Squidward	Okay, would you like any fries with that?
Squidward	SpongeBob, order up.  Welcome to The Krusty  SpongeBob, what in Neptune's...  SpongeBob?  Well, his spatula's still warm.  Well, SpongeBob. I must admit this is strange behavior, even for you.
Squidward	Well, do you want to order something or do you just want to block my reading light?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	You really need to see a doctor.
Squidward	But that's SpongeBob's job!
Squidward	Well, there are some men out back with a delivery and want you to sign.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, don't you think you might be taking all this a little bit too far?
Squidward	Where'd you get them?
Squidward	Patrick, it smells like something crawled in your brain and died.
Squidward	I don't know about you, but I'm going on my coffee break. A very long coffee break.
Squidward	I'll give him eleven minutes.
Squidward	Can we please stop this?
Squidward	Quality food?
Squidward	D'oh!  Only pathetic losers with horrible taste would eat this garbage!
Squidward	"Does your middle name happen to be ""No SpongeBob within a thousand kilometers of here""?"
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, tell these guys to let go of me!
Squidward	Couldn't you at least give them tables to eat on?
Squidward	This is a new low, even for YOU TWO. Lucky for you, I was here today. Stealing artifacts could land you in the stony loneso...  ahh! ahh! ahh! ome! You boobs found the missing half to the Atlantean amulet?
Squidward	For reasons unknown, this great city disappeared one day, but no ruins were ever found. All the inventions that you take for granted, were given to us by the Atlanteans. Their advances in art, financial wealth and weaponry were eons ahead of their time!
Squidward	These two chowder brains found the missing half to the amulet of Atlantis.
Squidward	Ah, what I wouldn't give for a foot-rub.
Squidward	Hey look, it's Atlantis.
Squidward	Okay, I've seen enough. Let me out of this thing!  What's going on here? I... Oh no.
Squidward	This stuff is wonderful and all but when are we going to see some real Atlantean culture?
Squidward	This place is amazing!  Isn't this great, isn't this neat, I'm a living work of art from my head to my feet! From the very first drawings on walls in caves, art has been what the heart and soul craves! So pick up a brush, a pencil or pen. If you don't like this one, paint it again! From now on please call me Sir Real. I can wait for your impression to congeal. Take it from an undersea renaissance man. I'd even look great on the side of your van! Any way you carve it, I am art and art is me. Ask your mama or your dada to tell you about the uh, schism. Between minimalism and cubism. My personality may be of the cynical type. But I've finally found something that lives up to the hype. I can say honestly and with great certainty, that Atlantis is where I want to spend, eternity
Squidward	What is wrong with you two morons?
Squidward	And back to my depressing life of quiet desperation.
Squidward	SpongeBob, I'm...
Squidward	The Krusty Krab welcomes...  the Tarpon twins' birthday party. Here are your Krabby Kids Meals.
Squidward	Grr! Grr! Agrr!! Grrr!  Why aren't these things working?!  Out of the Daydream
Squidward	Oh that's great news, because I want to move as soon as possible.
Squidward	SpongeBob! No one will ever buy my house with him living next door! Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite! Opposite... opposite...
Squidward	Why, it's Opposite Day!  You mean you've never heard of it? Boy, have you been missing out! Opposite Day is the one day of the year when you get to act different! Normally I'm stuffy, boring, but today I'm silly and spontaneous!
Squidward	Yeah! Why don't you get a jump on it.
Squidward	I'll tell you what's terrible! Living next to you! You're the worst neighbor in history!
Squidward	"Oh, Opposite Day. Next time, it's going to be ""Go Jump Off A Cliff Day!"""
Squidward	Why, I'm Squidward!
Squidward	No, no, no, no, no!
Squidward	Let me show you guys how much I... hate you!
Squidward	Well, since you can't bring any customers into the Krusty Krab, have you ever thought about bringing the Krusty Krab to the customers?
Squidward	"Did you get any of Patrick's ""gold""?"
Squidward	If I knew, do you think I'd be standing here getting yelled at by a bunch of morons?
Squidward	So, you're saying this thing can actually find SpongeBob?
Squidward	Ha! Is that your version of a threat?
Squidward	Hurry up!  Decorative egg, here I come.
Squidward	Ohh It's BEAU-TI-FUL!  STOOOOOP!
Squidward	excuse me for just a second.
Squidward	I don't care!  $4.19, please.
Squidward	SpongeBob?
Squidward	What did she call me?
Squidward	Oh, don't worry.
Squidward	I guessed I kept them waiting a little too long. I know, a little music should soothe their hunger.
Squidward	SpongeBob! You gotta help me! They stole my bubble bath! Public life ain't all it's cracked up to be. I want my old life back.
Squidward	You better hurt me or I'm really gonna hurt you!
Squidward	Spo... hang on a sec  ... let me... uhhhh...
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	I knew I shouldn't have gotten out of bed today.
Squidward	How long has he been standing over there?
Squidward	There's two of them?!
Squidward	This isn't Squilliam Fancyson, my life long rival who I met in high school band class, is it?
Squidward	Who's that talking in the background?
Squidward	Hello, my name is Squidward Tentacles, and my house is far fancier than that slob Squilliam's!
Squidward	It's the day you go away, and never come back.
Squidward	All right, first of all I'm going to give you something so simple, that a person without a brain could even get it done right.
Squidward	SpongeBob, what was that noise?  Skin me alive and drench me in boiling oil! What have you done to my living room? I told you just to paint the faded spot.
Squidward	Ow! SpongeBob, I told you not to move it until I say...  Ow! Why do you keep moving it?
Squidward	Okay, SpongeBob, I finished... What the?
Squidward	I have-... I have?
Squidward	Give me a break. You don't know anything about music! Too bad you're not a musical genius, like me.
Squidward	Hello?
Squidward	We're gonna be stars!
Squidward	That counts as talking.
Squidward	Does a movie like that even exist?
Squidward	Let me show you to your table.
Squidward	And I can see it now... your daughter Pearl, her name up in lights.
Squidward	No one, not even your parents, would want to see that.  What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.
Squidward	No one is going to watch you engorge yourself.
Squidward	Good evening and welcome to the 1st annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show. Sponsored by the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty, because no one else would give it a home.  Thank you. Our next act is living proof that nepotism is alive and well.  Put your fins together for...  Put your...  Put...  Pearl.
Squidward	Yes.
Squidward	You bottom feeders! You don't even know talent!
Squidward	They've all taken their grand-guppies to see the guts and gore across the street.
Squidward	SpongeBob, will you keep it down? I am trying to hone my musical talent here.
Squidward	Original compositions wanted? Me, a famous composer?  Thank you!  That would be nice.
Squidward	No!  Get out!  Patrick, what're you doing here?
Squidward	Can't you two be quiet for one day? My composition is due tomorrow.
Squidward	Here you go, maestro, my masterpiece.
Squidward	Ooh... What the  ...now?
Squidward	There are two kinds of people. There are people that are normal.  And then there's you.
Squidward	Oh, great. SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty.  What, no annoying blurbs today?  Hmm strangely quiet.  SpongeBob?
Squidward	Oh, really?
Squidward	Yeah, I'll uh...see you.
Squidward	Good, just coming by to get a drink.
Squidward	There you are, sir.  Oh, yes it's time again. I've been meaning to say this but I've come to appreciate your demeanor lately.
Squidward	You know, SpongeBob, it's OK to be a little different.
Squidward	It's me, Squidward. I'm looking for SpongeBob.  Hi, how are ya?
Squidward	37... 38...
Squidward	I hear you! I hear you!
Squidward	What's that?
Squidward	This thing here.
Squidward	Injury. Your brain is injured!  Wait a minute. Did you say that you got that splinter injury
Squidward	Finds out about this injury.
Squidward	It was a good shift while it lasted.
Squidward	Sorry, the rules are the rules.  Yeah, it'll be pretty quiet around here with Mr. Krabs sending you home early and all. I just hope we'll make it through the whole rest of this day without you here.
Squidward	I don't have to tell Mr. Krabs.  Because he already knows.
Squidward	Ow!
Squidward	Ahhhh... smell that fresh morning sea!  La da dum dum dee.
Squidward	Ahhhh.... I should have guessed. It's too early for this.
Squidward	Hey! Get out of here! Huh?
Squidward	Get out of there!!!
Squidward	I gotta get out of here!!!
Squidward	How would you like it if someone did THIS to you?!
Squidward	Well... If you insist...
Squidward	Goo goo wa wa goo goo wa goo goo he ha wa...  ha ha ha!
Squidward	Let's give them a grand finale they'll never forget!
Squidward	What are you talking about nitwit?!
Squidward	Oh this is too precious! You're sun bleached! Looks like you won't be at the party.  Sun Bleached!
Squidward	What are you two doing here?
Squidward	Then have some more!  Still want that ice cream?
Squidward	Oh no, I only paid for it. I wouldn't want to deprive you of it.
Squidward	What did you do?
Squidward	Oh, tell me about it.
Squidward	No wait, don't.
Squidward	What did you do to me?
Squidward	What the?
Squidward	Okay, okay, I'm nice.  Now will you leave me alone?
Squidward	Uhh, I'm a lamp post?
Squidward	What the? Get out of there!  You two have ruined my life!
Squidward	Down there, sir!
Squidward	I thought I told that kid not to put the organic sea cucumber on top of the free range anemones! Well at least my flowers survived the trip.  SpongeBob, would you please find your own flowers to sniff!
Squidward	Yeah I've got it...  ...right here.
Squidward	What's wrong with the pin head?
Squidward	That was my cheese. It's supposed to smell like that, kelp for brains!
Squidward	And one, and...
Squidward	That's right! I was in a tap contest on the night in question. As you can see from my third place medallion.
Squidward	SpongeBob, I will give you $5 if you let me enjoy the rest of my morning, in peace.
Squidward	It's hot choclolate.
Squidward	Oh, why can't I just find?
Squidward	Oh,  that was a recumbent bicycle, and I sold it.
Squidward	Ticket? Officer, please! I have inpeckable boat smarts! I pried my self in obtaining an un-soiled driving record! It's all that I have!
Squidward	Do you mind?
Squidward	Why I'm.  All right, i'll tell you. I was trying to get away, from him! He is the bane, of my existence!
Squidward	Shut it.
Squidward	Eh, didn't see that coming.
Squidward	I was just leaving.
Squidward	SpongeBob? SpongeBob, I need your help.
Squidward	Before before.
Squidward	Next week?
Squidward	: We haven't sold any papers today.
Squidward	The fan stopped working.
Squidward	I told you!
Squidward	You idiot!
Squidward	Great.
Squidward	You've never even seen him!
Squidward	Look, surf-boy, are you gonna teach us how to surf, or are we just gonna stand here and stare at you all day?
Squidward	Oh, wonderful.
Squidward	And?
Squidward	All right, I'm done! Hey, blondey! Teach me how to surf so I can go home, or I'm gonna...
Squidward	Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Squidward	Look!
Squidward	Fi-ga-ro!
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	Oh, what a lovely day! For me!
Squidward	None of your business!
Squidward	No
Squidward	No You Can't!  If you must know..... I will be a feature solo for an impending concert performance with the Bikini Bottom's Men's choir. And in the big time... Not playtime. Now if you excuse me.
Squidward	La La La La La La La, La La La La La La La, La La.
Squidward	Fi-Ga-Ro  Fi-Ga-Ro!
Squidward	Oh! I'm almost late for Choir Practice! Better not run into SpongeBob again or I'm doomed!
Squidward	A singing traffic ...
Squidward	Just in time!
Squidward	SpongeBob?
Squidward	You're the only one talking.
Squidward	Oh really?
Squidward	They are believed to have discovered ketchup....
Squidward	Their favorite movies are in black and white.
Squidward	SpongeBob! Can't you see I am trying to work?
Squidward	Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
Squidward	Would you mind telling us what this is all about?
Squidward	Well, if you must know, I'm a widely renowned clarinet virtuoso, state-recognized interior design consultant, licensed and board certified antique macrame conosuor, born and raised collector and sculptor of driftwood, and able to recognize over 13 hundred brand names of single-personed pedal operate vehicles at a single glance. Plus, I make a killer Souffl.
Squidward	It's all yours.
Squidward	Roger! Is that you?
Squidward	Ah. This almost makes the other three hundred and fifty-three days worth living for.
Squidward	But...but, I..I...I....
Squidward	Psychic powers. Hey! Where's Patrick?
Squidward	No!
Squidward	Oh. Now that you two have ruined the last good thing in my life,...I think I'll go slam my head in the door. Repeatedly.
Squidward	Say good-bye.
Squidward	Out!
Squidward	What? What kind of initiation?
Squidward	What's this? Can it be? My lodge robes! I'm back in the lodge! I gotta try 'em on!  Huh? This can't be right! These aren't my cephalopod robes!
Squidward	Grrr...no.
Squidward	Huh.
Squidward	Do not worry. I will save you. Be gone, foul beast, or, I will smite thee.
Squidward	May I help you?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Before you ask me that question, ask yourself this: Why would I leave the comfort of  home for your dirty ?
Squidward	SpongeBob!  I need the right tool for the job. Huh?
Squidward	Are you done cleaning up that dingy hole you call home?
Squidward	No! It isn't! You can't just steal my decorating style, and...  Never mind. Just give me my vacuum.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Imbecile.
Squidward	My hallway...  Dear Neptune!  He even got the chip in the paint from when I moved in!  Okay, Squiddy. Don't get creeped out. Just get the vacuum cleaner and go home.  Oh, right. Isn't this neat? My bathroom.  I have to give him credit, though.Every detail is correct.  How does he know the exact contents of my medicine cabinet?  My rash cream??  That little sneak!
Squidward	Guh... will you excuse me for a moment? I need to use the bathroom again.
Squidward	SpongeBob!  Is it really you?  It is you!  Come on, baby. We are gonna walk out of this horror show the way we walked into it: with dignity and pride.  My house...
Squidward	Ah... Replica, sweet replica.
Squidward	Do I know you?
Squidward	Being too darn happy all the time!
Squidward	Oh, I'd love to.
Squidward	Why? I don't think it's going anywhere.
Squidward	Here's the slop you ordered.  Enjoy. If you can choke it down.
Squidward	What is?
Squidward	No, I am not, nor would I ever want to be! I am quite content being Squidward Q. Tentacles.
Squidward	I'm... Squilliam Fancyson.
Squidward	Who? Ha, um, uh, and a good evening to you as well.
Squidward	Yes?
Squidward	There, now how does  feel, Billy?
Squidward	Didn't you two nincompoops know? I have my name legally changed to Squilliam Fancyson. And you are to refer to me only as Professor Squilliam from now until the end of time. Now blink twice so I know you understand.  Okay, good.  Hey, he blinked three times!
Squidward	Wow, those  impressive results.
Squidward	You were tickling yourself?
Squidward	There. Now, as I was saying, music is a series of complex...  SpongeBob, I told you to stop tickling yourself!
Squidward	I have never heard anything more insipid, insane, uninteresting, or irrelevant!
Squidward	Ha! Ha! Ha! What the...?
Squidward	No, SpongeBob, that was a garden gnome.
Squidward	Will you two nincompoops cut it out?! Or am I gonna...
Squidward	Hotter? Scoop?!
Squidward	You once again managed to single-handedly annihilate what might be the one and only chance I may ever get to sew just one tiny seed of creative hope into the culturally barren wasteland that each and every one of us is forced to call home!
Squidward	"No, no, no, no, no! They said ""Squilliam""!"
Squidward	But...
Squidward	Hey Patrick, do you know what time it is?
Squidward	What is the matter with you two?
Squidward	Quiet! Now, do as you're told! Lest ye incur the wrath of Squidward!
Squidward	Toulouse-Lautrec.
Squidward	Cherry pie.  Where'd you get that?
Squidward	Oh, my.  Always having to have it our way, don't we? Oh, boo-hoo.
Squidward	Ow, what the heck was that?
Squidward	Well, I'm going to go check.
Squidward	Now what?
Squidward	SpongeBob, I have a confession to make.
Squidward	I'm not your master, I'm your neighbor. Now do me a favor and please stop doing me favors.
Squidward	Don't you know that its 7:00 in thehuh?
Squidward	Later.
Squidward	Wake me up when I care.
Squidward	And you ruined my regulary scheduled Krusty Krab nap?
Squidward	What is it?
Squidward	Would you like to hear a secret?
Squidward	"Why don't you give him a couple of pointers. Let him cook his own patty, and don't take ""no"" for an answer. He's shy.  This should be good."
Squidward	SpongeBob, what're you doing?
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Hey, SpongeBob, do you want to hear another Krusty Krab secret?
Squidward	Ah, but you'll be doing it on purpose.
Squidward	Lower!
Squidward	If you want the customers to stay, you need to provide some entertainment!
Squidward	I'm entertaining those heathens.
Squidward	Don't look at me, I'm just here to hold his hat.
Squidward	Ladda-de ladd-dum ladda-do... Hey! What are you doing in my house?
Squidward	They've all gone to the Chum Bucket.
Squidward	That was probably me.
Squidward	What? I have never fallen asleep on duty.
Squidward	It only took you eleventy-seven years for you to figure that out?
Squidward	Battening down the word hatches, sir.
Squidward	and cold.
Squidward	It's this way.
Squidward	You left your TV on.
Squidward	This is not happening. It's just not happening.
Squidward	Good Morning, Not SpongeBob.
Squidward	What? No. I'm just-- I
Squidward	I never made anyone sick with envy.
Squidward	Ow!
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, look.
Squidward	No! I what storm?
Squidward	Well, I think I'll pass.
Squidward	Yes, they did, when you turned them off!
Squidward	Three!
Squidward	There, I win. See?
Squidward	I told you creatures I was trying to take a nap over here. Now for the last time can't you just
Squidward	I've got to get out of here!
Squidward	I have an even better idea.
Squidward	Oh, no, no spelling.
Squidward	I brought some!
Squidward	Identific? Fine. But when this storm blows over, you'll regret this, mister. What the what? I don't have them. they must be in my other pants. Look, if you just let me cross, I can go get them. Please, I promise I'll
Squidward	Please. I just want to get back onto my side of boundary.
Squidward	My food!
Squidward	No, no, no, no, no, no, not that. I mean from outside.
Squidward	Oof! Oh, curse you, Preflumster!
Squidward	Now, what?
Squidward	Whatever it is, no.
Squidward	Thank you. Thank you. This next one, I wrote myself. I like to call it, 'Three Barnacles are a Crowd Unless They've Known Each Other for a Really Long Time.'
Squidward	If pleases the king, I would like to preform a...
Squidward	All of the most intelligent programming starts before 5 AM.
Squidward	"Oh, yeah, I haven't made the coffee yet.  Why in the world would they cancel ""Fab and Fancy?"" What could possibly be more enriching?  What?!"
Squidward	I'm quite certain you wouldn't know culture if it bit you on the guitar!
Squidward	It's that easy?  Hello? Bikini Bottom Public Access?  Give me a TV show! Give me a TV show! I want a show!  Come on! Just a few more minutes, Squiddie, and it will be your turn to bask in the limelight!
Squidward	I know I'm on TV! See the camera?  You're on TV too!
Squidward	Patrick, just how dumb are you?
Squidward	If you like the camera so much, why don't you be the cameraman?
Squidward	Imbeciles!  Today, we're going to be talking about...  Why isn't the camera on me? No! I'm the one talking!  I'm right here! Ahem! Today on Squidward Chat... we'll be discussing the under-appreciated arts.  Patrick, I'm down here!  As I was saying, today, we'll be...  Today...
Squidward	Out!
Squidward	Get off my set! This is not working!
Squidward	The coast looks clear...
Squidward	Would you please stop dancing?
Squidward	But, you must do exactly what I say. Got that?
Squidward	That's right. You need some physical conditioning before you  set foot on a dance parquet. I want you to run to the top of Oyster Peak then back. {
Squidward	Fine!  Let's move on to our first dance lesson.  I want you to moonwalk on this treadmill while I read this entire novel!
Squidward	Now, do just as I did.
Squidward	Then do it!  Enough! Listen, you pea-brain, we are gonna keep working on your routine until you get it right!  And I don't care how long it takes! Now, watch closely.  And a-one...  And a-two...  And aha!! You think you can handle that?
Squidward	Better go check on the little yellow sea-monkey's progress.  Well, SpongeBob, have you learned the moves?
Squidward	I'm still not convinced.  Do it again.
Squidward	Observe a true master at work.
Squidward	Not so fast! That crab is a food thief! He snuck into my house in the middle of the night, stole every last morsel in my kitchen, and he even swiped my entire collection of smoked kielbasas.
Squidward	Hello, police?
Squidward	It's about time.  Hey SpongeBob, love the outfit. Where'd you get it, the hardware store?!  Hardware store!
Squidward	I'm gonna blow a fuse if you don't get that order up.
Squidward	Don't know, don't want to.
Squidward	Annoy Squidward Day?
Squidward	Oh, for what? To get my face on the Wall of Shame?
Squidward	You're losing it! Don't you know that award is a load of...  ...garbage.
Squidward	And this is a symbol of what I think of the 'Employee of the Month' award!
Squidward	Stop it, SpongeBob! If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!
Squidward	Oh, that's it, square-for-brains! That's it! I'm going to show you how easy it is to win that award. I'm going to be the new 'Employee of the Month'! I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!
Squidward	I'm watching you, SpongeBob. You're not leaving before me.
Squidward	I'm going to wring you dry when I get out of here! Now get me out of here!
Squidward	SpongeBob! Why you little!
Squidward	Ok, let's have a good clean fight.
Squidward	Clean tables, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward	And would you have Kelp Fries with that?
Squidward	And it's taken you this long to figure that out?
Squidward	Deluxe Krabby Patties.  Juuust what the world needed.
Squidward	I'll give you points for honesty.
Squidward	No, I'm not!
Squidward	Another beautiful Sunday in Bikini Bottom. Nothing can ruin my good mood today!
Squidward	Yes I did, and I like to complain!
Squidward	Stupid Policeman, I'm no litter bug!  Hey! No more trash! Looks like I'm done!
Squidward	No! I... um... er... volunteering! Yeah, I'm cleaning up Bikini Bottom, selflessly devoting my time to a worthy cause.
Squidward	What? No!
Squidward	No thank you! I'll do it myself.
Squidward	No way!
Squidward	Well... you gonna help me!?
Squidward	Oh brother.
Squidward	Well I don't know how you did it but thank you for getting rid of all that trash. They'll have that statue of me built in no time!  My house!
Squidward	Where's my house?
Squidward	Wait! Zip it! I have an idea!  Here stand in this.  See ya sucker!
Squidward	What is that?!
Squidward	Can I help you?
Squidward	That'll be $4.99.
Squidward	SpongeBob, one extra large order of sea fries.
Squidward	One large sea fries. Extra weird.
Squidward	Oh, here it is.
Squidward	Knock yourselves out!
Squidward	Ahh.. What a day!
Squidward	1 Krabby Patty coming up!
Squidward	Grr.. I can't take this any more!
Squidward	This is an outrage! I no longer tolerate my personal items being soiled by the ravels that crawls in this restaurant! I demand a place to put my stuff!
Squidward	Not at a whale's age.
Squidward	Just don't touch my clarinet!
Squidward	Velvet..
Squidward	I hope you're not trying to shove the boxes into that locker!
Squidward	Fine. but remember, It's vitally important that nothing happens to it
Squidward	Yeah, Just a bit of a... renovation.
Squidward	There. 368-B
Squidward	10182-E.
Squidward	SpongeBob, Wait!
Squidward	Where am I? What is this place?
Squidward	Yes, my clarinet! Which I am the proud owner.
Squidward	I've learned..  I've learned respect...
Squidward	ha ha! Wha the- SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!
Squidward	Where are you going you imbecile?!
Squidward	I tried to get my clarinet in there...  Impossible!
Squidward	I'll show you a friendly gesture! Do you know the horror I've endured?!  Let's see how you like it!
Squidward	I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I actually would like to help, but I'm just too busy right now.
Squidward	Really. We haven't had a customer since the day this highway was built!
Squidward	Eugene!
Squidward	Look on the bright side, at least I don't have to put up with you anymore! Ha,ha! This could be the start of something beautiful! OW! What the-!
Squidward	Steal your soul.
Squidward	SpongeBob.
Squidward	Krabby Patty nothing!  KRABBY PATTY NOTHING!!!  What now?
Squidward	I have no idea.
Squidward	Oh, nonsense! I bet you can't go the rest of the day without crying.
Squidward	There's a first time for everything.  Also, I'd like to win this bet as soon as possible.
Squidward	Is that a tear I see?
Squidward	Oh, SpongeBob.
Squidward	No problem.
Squidward	It's getting late. I'd better bring out the big guns.  Oh, SpongeBob.
Squidward	"Oh, I just said, ""Relax and enjoy the song."""
Squidward	How about a bedtime story?
Squidward	But, he was sad, because...because he was lost... he was lost and very sad. And then, he he started to cry.  He cried and he cried. And he cried even more.  And he kept crying...  ...and crying and crying and crying and...that's right. You can do it.
Squidward	Hey! It's hard to get my beauty sleep when people keep dropping junk on my head.
Squidward	Whoo-
Squidward	I quit.
Squidward	"""Thank you for submitting your play, entitled 'Squidward: Strokes of Genius'. Your work speaks volumes about you as an artist, a person, and a member of society."""
Squidward	But my play doesn't have singing-
Squidward	Wow! Look at all these aspiring actors wanting to take part in my genius!
Squidward	It's time!
Squidward	Bring up the stage lights!
Squidward	Go away, go away, shoo, shoo, go away, go away.
Squidward	At the Krusty Krab, his talent was wasted.
Squidward	But, who will refill the empty chasm in my soul?
Squidward	Would any of you want this job?
Squidward	Fine. SpongeBob! One Krabby Patty with ketchup! And now, we come to the worst part of my job...working with him.
Squidward	Talent.
Squidward	Taken for granted, uncredited, overlooked, ignored. Disrespected, unappreciated, unloved. But worst of all...underpaid.
Squidward	All right! SpongeBob, where's that Patty?!
Squidward	Oh, puh-leeze. You wouldn't know quality if it hit you in the face!
Squidward	Oh, no! Sallys in trouble!
Squidward	SpongeBob, the next time you invite me to one of your slumber parties, Im calling the cops!   Arrgh, Arrgh, oh, oh. What the? SpongeBob!
Squidward	: Right... SpongeBob, I promise not to tell Mr. Krabs about this if you promise that I don't have to see you again for the rest of the day.
Squidward	I'll have you know, sir, that  is a-- pile of gravel?!
Squidward	Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?
Squidward	Well, I don't. Get somebody else.
Squidward	I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.
Squidward	Well, time to go. Don't want to be late. Have fun, bye-bye.
Squidward	This is going to be the best three days of my life.  I'm going to do all the things I can't normally do because of SpongeBob.  Well, thus ends the greatest weekend of my life. No SpongeBob, no Patrick, nothing but me, me, me.   The snail! I forgot the snail!  I've got to do something.  Okay, okay ,okay. Here we go. Here we go. Right here.  Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat. You've gotta finish this food!
Squidward	Oh, just checking up on old Gary for you.
Squidward	Aww, SpongeBob, I don't want to do...
Squidward	Well, you made me do it.
Squidward	He just needed water?
Squidward	I hope I never see another snail again. Good night, Clary.  Who could that be? As if I didn't already know.  SpongeBob, I already told you. You're gonna be just fi-i-i...
Squidward	Uh-oh!
Squidward	Meow , me-  Ommf!
Squidward	Nope, I'm right here.
Squidward	Maybe he's doing his morning dumpster dive for change.
Squidward	OOOHHHH! This is the Bikini Bottom Triangle? Looks more like a dump.
Squidward	Oh, I think Mr. Krabs is doing just fine.
Squidward	Ohh yeah, that's nice. I'll be here working while you.....AHHHHHHHH!  Uhhhh. Uhhh...Ummmm...I'm sorry mam,  but were closed. . I know you're hungry but- . Uhhh...but we really are closed. Thank-you, come-again.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Never...
Squidward	What a creepy old hagfish, I thought she'd never leave.
Squidward	And why is that?
Squidward	There is a no-contract clause in it too.
Squidward	Don't touch me.
Squidward	Owwwwwww. That's better...
Squidward	Gratitude? You've been wallowing in filth all morning. What could you possibly be grateful for?
Squidward	No, SpongeBob. I don't want your help EVER AGAIN!
Squidward	Ha ha ha.
Squidward	I don't have time to count all that!
Squidward	SpongeBob, I hate my job, and I live in a dead end town with neighbors I can't stand. I'm the most miserable person in Bikini Bottom! What do I have to be thankful for?
Squidward	Don't know, don't care.
Squidward	That's Krusty Krab property.  That's a load-bearing column.  Hurry, SpongeBob.
Squidward	I choose Patrick...  to play in Patrick's yard...  and SpongeBob in SpongeBob's yard. And nobody...
Squidward	Where are those two morons?  WHERE ARE THEY?!
Squidward	That was an insult.
Squidward	THANK YOU?!?
Squidward	"And I'm gonna play ""Sit and Relax"" until you're finished.  Barnacle Brains.  SpongeBob!"
Squidward	Twwwwwwwwwooooooo!
Squidward	I'M GONNA-  Uh, oh.
Squidward	A... What?
Squidward	No, thank you for completely failing our future generations with your donation. I mean, seriously, ma'am, did you just grab the first thing you saw this morning?
Squidward	Uh-huh. Tell me, what do you know about this plate?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Oh, no, you don't!
Squidward	Wha...? Oh! Has it been 50 years already?  Yes! I knew I'd still be hot!
Squidward	Okay, beloved sanctuary. I'll see you after work.  And we'll have a nice, relaxing evening.  Just you and me.  That is, Of course, if I can survive another day  with GratingBob ShrillPants.
Squidward	Okay. I can do this. Just put them out of my mi...
Squidward	You're playing flashlight tag with an electric eel?
Squidward	All I want to do is live in a world where I can live in peace!
Squidward	When I get those two, I am gonna...!  All right, you two, I...
Squidward	It's delicious! What is it?
Squidward	Ahhhh, this is the life!
Squidward	You've destroyed my beautiful world!
Squidward	I think I'll treat Bikini Bottom to some real music.  Yow!
Squidward	No!
Squidward	No!
Squidward	No!
Squidward	No, I'm not ready! I'll never be ready! Don't you get it?!
Squidward	Hold on a second. I'll be right out.  Hello...?  Ahh, alone at last.
Squidward	Sp... SpongeBob? Is that you?
Squidward	Wha...?  Oh, my...  Impossible! He's lying!  He's right!
Squidward	J-just listen to me! I'm not supposed to be here! I've gotta get home to my own time period! I've gotta go!
Squidward	He's not here. No more SpongeBob. No more! I may finally have found a place where I can be all...  ...alooooooone.
Squidward	No! D'oh! Who's the barnacle head who invented that game anyway?
Squidward	You don't know how long I've waited to hear those words!
Squidward	I don't care. Just can it!
Squidward	A sign that you're a true boob?
Squidward	Oh, he's obsessed with  his artless pop tune.
Squidward	Alright. You're greatful. Now leave me alone.
Squidward	La da dee, la da dum, la da doo...
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Oh, boy.
Squidward	For those who care, I am nothing short of an artistic genius.
Squidward	Oh, I don't know, 12?
Squidward	I can't make a work for the ages overnight. Art does not march to a ticking clock. Art shall come when art is good and ready, sir.
Squidward	And don't dilly... (SpongeBob pushes a giant stone into the Krusty Krab) ...dally. Nice rock.
Squidward	I am posing you! Did you think the sculpture was going to make itself? (shot of Mr. Krabs from behind) Don't you want the money this statue's going to bring in? (Mr. Krabs drops the towel)
Squidward	Nope.
Squidward	As long as it takes. (Squidward uses various tools for sculpting. SpongeBob poses for a bit but Squidward sends him away. Mr. Krabs grows tired of the post but SpongeBob helps him out by putting a spoon and fork under his arms to help them stay up. Cut to next morning where Squidward gets finished with the sculpture and sighs)
Squidward	Voila! (Mr. Krabs frowns after looking it then shatters into pieces)
Squidward	This is art, not a swing set!
Squidward	As long as you're wanting to sell this many patties. (Mr. Krabs groans)
Squidward	We're closed. Come back tomorrow.
Squidward	Oh, so hilarious.
Squidward	Why would you want to practice such horrible sounds?
Squidward	Morons.
Squidward	Magic.
Squidward	$4.99!? That's highway robbery!
Squidward	Actually, yes.
Squidward	SpongeBob, what are you doing?
Squidward	The wiener!
Squidward	.
Squidward	Forest freak.
Squidward	Actually, I have a hot date with my toenail clippers tonight, but I thought of that.
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	SpongeBob, did you get those bathrooms mopped yet?
Squidward	It's finally complete!  After weeks and weeks of burning the candle at both ends,  literally,  my first clarinet concerto is complete and ready to be performed!  NO!  Now, I'm flummoxed.  Drggh.
Squidward	No!
Squidward	Wow! To think this day started off so horribly and now... What do you mean you're just gonna rent out your front yard?
Squidward	Oh no, I'm sorry I can't.
Squidward	Hello, Howard.
Squidward	Passions?
Squidward	Wait!  I was...just kidding!
Squidward	Oh! Well, they're just like any other neighbors.
Squidward	Well, you won't even NOTICE what the neighbors around here are like!
Squidward	There's nobody here!
Squidward	Oh, sorry. I was just wondering if we could...
Squidward	Squiddy, this is definitely your best day ever!
Squidward	Why, Howard, I would never hide anything from you!
Squidward	I know I can handle two dunderheads, but I draw the line at three!
Squidward	Try reading the sign, Casanova.
Squidward	I like my frowns in their regular orientation.
Squidward	She speaks art jargon!
Squidward	SpongeBob, I don't know what I'm doing! I've never felt like this before.
Squidward	Don't forget artistic and musical.
Squidward	SpongeBob, you've gotta help me! It's been so long! What do I do?
Squidward	Dear Neptune!
Squidward	Go where?
Squidward	There!
Squidward	Can we go now?
Squidward	Gotcha.
Squidward	Oh, no you don't, Patrick! SpongeBob and I are in the middle of a practice date!!
Squidward	"Don't ""um, Squidward"" me, you, you annoying, insignificant, waste of my time!"
Squidward	And you probably think I'm a mean, spirited brute, which is the exact opposite of what you were expecting, right?
Squidward	Would you two pipe down!
Squidward	Well make rock some where else. My house is full of sand.
Squidward	Do you think she looks a little...miffed?
Squidward	Oh no. That is definitely not the spirit Patrick. Your sister is out of control!
Squidward	The time for talk is over. now is the time for action!  A rock made of sand by two idiots is no match for one carved from the...  tides of time!
Squidward	Where is that idiot SpongeBob, leaving me to do all the cooking? This job stinks!  Eugh. Literally.  Mr. Krabs!  There's something in the kitchen you gotta see!
Squidward	I cannot believe I have to deliver all this junk food myself.  What the-  Oh, thank you.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs?  Mr. Krabs!  MR. KRABS!  Your shelf collapsed on me, and I twisted my ankle!
Squidward	Oh, no no no, don't touch me!  SpongeBob, would you mind letting go of my nose?
Squidward	I could sure use a pillow.
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Hello, Office Workers Safety Department....
Squidward	"I'll be glad to.  I mean, I can live the whole tragic episode, if I must. It was just another day at the Krusty Krab, I was at the register, giving it a nice shine between orders, when something a party bun with 10 seeds, instead of 11. Now I wasn't about to stand by and watch a customer go without all his guaranteed nutrients and  vitamins. So I stung in to action."""
Squidward	WHAT?!?
Squidward	Good thing you didn't hire a professional to do that.
Squidward	Sounds like a lot of extra work to me.
Squidward	SpongeBob, two large, two medium. I hate my job.
Squidward	Oh it's days like this that make me wish I had gone back to college.
Squidward	There you are sir. The ketchup is in the b--What? Did somebody order a Krabby Patty?
Squidward	Ow! I'm not faking it you know. That really hurts! A lot!
Squidward	Now you have to replace it.
Squidward	Good thing you're around to never notice the obvious!
Squidward	Hurry SpongeBob! I got 26 more orders!
Squidward	Mr. Krabs!
Squidward	Don't care.
Squidward	I don't care! Listen up, I will not be woken from my nap again, and if I am, I'm gonna...
Squidward	What's going on here?
Squidward	Oh, dear me. I know. I hope I never forget this moment.
Squidward	Officially creeped out now.
Squidward	You can certainly help...  Why are you wearing garbage?
Squidward	Thank goodness you're here, officer.
Squidward	Sorry, SpongeBob, the law is the law. We can't just pick and choose which ones we follow.
Squidward	Ma'am? It's a nightshirt!  This is all your fault! You have to get rid of your junk right now!
Squidward	Creepy.
Squidward	Idiot.  What the...?! SpongeBob, why is my house filled with photos of your dumb junk?
Squidward	Yes, Your Highness.  SpongeBob!
Squidward	Please SpongeBob, no tricks.
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	Don't we get enough of you during the day?
Squidward	I don't have time for this!  Tea time. Of all the ridiculous concepts![walks onto ice, and slips, the ice cracks, and Squidward falls in, losing his winter clothes, and floats back up in a block of ice, with a shocked face]
Squidward	Huh? This isn't mine...  Waaaahhh!
Squidward	We's might have actually a chance of getting back if we had a sleigh.
Squidward	When are you two gonna grow up?
Squidward	I know I'm going to regret this... Alright! I will take on this mission!
Squidward	Why in a million years will I let you tag along?
Squidward	Let me escort you to my place my good sir! We need to start with personal grooming for your grown-up makeover!
Squidward	Excuse me! Grown-ups do not high-five!
Squidward	Patrick! I'm sure you'd rather have some tetrazzini we grown-ups ordered, right?
Squidward	Boring!?
Squidward	And that's what I told them look I wanted to...
Squidward	No buts! We are through entertaining your company! Shall we?
Squidward	Nothing, let's find our seats.
Squidward	What the?!
Squidward	That's what I thought you- No! No! No! I didn't mean it like that! It was-
Squidward	MUST I DO EVERYTHING MYSELF?  Huh? Stay back! You'll get your patty when it's your turn.
Squidward	I don't care! If you want to hear what real music sounds like, then listen to this.  Hey, give it back. I was just reaching my coda.
Squidward	None of you know a great musician when you hear him! Not a single one of you! Not evenevenoh, there's nobody there.
Squidward	Well, let me tell you something, mister. I know exactly who you are and why you're here.
Squidward	Why, yes, it is, isn't it?
Squidward	Are you sure you got the right squid?
Squidward	My very own fan.
Squidward	A-one, a-two, a-one, a-two, a-three, a-four.
Squidward	Yes?
Squidward	Oh, I don't work the grill; I work the register.
Squidward	It's been your constant encouragement that has helped me progress to new musical heights. I'm hitting notes I never even knew existed.
Squidward	Once again, I hate people.
Squidward	Sorry, SpongeBob. Berets are only worn for true artists, like moi.
Squidward	Crafts?  This isn't summer camp. I am a true artiste.
Squidward	What? No! No, you can't do that!
Squidward	You can't give that dunderhead the artist hat!
Squidward	I'll bet he never sells another!
Squidward	Oh, not you again! May I take your order?
Squidward	Just order already!
Squidward	In case you haven't noticed,  this is not an artist hat!
Squidward	Why don't you just concentrate on your patty?
Squidward	How 'bout the latte sipping?
Squidward	And there they go! Two whole days of no work and no SpongeBob! This is almost too good to be true! Nothing can possibly go wrong!
Squidward	Okay, I'm in!
Squidward	Oh, great. I wonder what my vision of eternal suffering will be!  Of course!
Squidward	Everyone's paying with bones.
Squidward	So sorry to have put such a wrinkle in your plans!
Squidward	Oh, thank you for eating at The Krusty Krab.  Can I give you a hand with that, SpongeBob?
Squidward	Oh no, I have a ticket. I just don't know what I'll do without you there.  Oh wait, I just realizedI'll be having the greatest time of my life!
Squidward	Oh, come on! Nothing but a scam.
Squidward	See all you fellow Kelpheads at the show.
Squidward	I said, I wonder where someone could get some lemonade.
Squidward	Well, okay, if you insist.
Squidward	Just grooving to the soothing waves of the Gentle G.
Squidward	But I dazzle. Oh.
Squidward	No I don'tketchup?
Squidward	I'm going to get those passes back even if I have to rip Patrick in half.  What the?
Squidward	Oh, well, at least we still have our seats.
Squidward	"""No backstage passes, no entry."""
Squidward	Hello, Kelpy. It's great to finally meet
Squidward	What? What? Who said that?
Squidward	SpongeBob you moron, you ruined my bon  ...sai.
Squidward	Sigh...which is why I keep telling you: Never try anything new, ever! Stick to what you're good at! And stick to it soon!
Squidward	No, I don't!
Squidward	There he is! He's headed straight for my glass menagerie!
Squidward	SpongeBob, I spent 6 long months on that painting!
Squidward	What am I doing!? What are  doing!?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	What? Oh, no! Wha--? No-ho, that was not me, I swear.  SpongeBob!  It's empty!  See empty!
Squidward	Oh, SpongeBob, I got a present for you.
Squidward	And.
Squidward	Yeah Patrick! Get back to...WHAT?!? WORK?!? Oh no! NO! NO! NO! Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Ah...don't mind if I do.  Ah...no better way to spend a break with a little cool jazz.  Huh?
Squidward	Wonderful.
Squidward	That depends...
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	Alright, right, let's look at this.
Squidward	No! I'm releasing you from this order.
Squidward	Hark, the odor you seek is before you.
Squidward	Sounds like you'd better stop bothering me and put on your thinking cap.
Squidward	Good riddance.  What's this? Something's familiar about those ketchup swirls.  Sweet Neptune! Could that have been...
Squidward	It all makes sense now! The dark denim, the dismal statements, the extensive use of red and yellow! This is directly out of his early abstract experiments!
Squidward	It's not yours to sell! I found it!
Squidward	But what do you mean 'all'? I'm not under arrest! I..I..I..uhh.. These are idiots! They're causing a ruckus! I..I want sleep!
Squidward	Mmm.
Squidward	Hmmm...  Oops, I accidentally burned up your memories.
Squidward	So what?
Squidward	You're right, SpongeBob, I don't have a happy memory. This is horrible.
Squidward	Mmm hmm.
Squidward	Why are we at the Art Museum?
Squidward	Yeah!
Squidward	What view?
Squidward	Uh oh...
Squidward	Yes...  Thanks for stopping by.
Squidward	Thanks...  Doesn't say who's it from. No doubt SpongeBob is hiding inside. Ah well, here goes nothing.  GOTCHA! Huh?  It's empty. Empty, just like my miserable life!  I see nothing but darkness ahead...  SpongeBob!?
Squidward	I can't feel my legs.
Squidward	Lend a hand? No!
Squidward	Ah! I'm unraveling!  If you ever, and I mean ever-  Ow! My neck. I'm gonna be in the chiropractor's for a week.
Squidward	So, I'm fired? No more taking orders?  No more interacting with customers? No more SpongeBob!? I'm free! Ha Ha! I'm free!  Whoo.
Squidward	SpongeBob!  Why don't you mop your way over the kitchen.  We need another Krabby Patty.
Squidward	I don't wanna make faces I want to sleep! D-de-de-de-Da!
Squidward	: Let's go SpongeBob, the orders are pouring out.
Squidward	- What is the hold up in here?
Squidward	Ah, time to relax.
Squidward	Yeah, so what?
Squidward	Right!
Squidward	Get out!
Squidward	SpongeBob...  What in the world are you giggling about?
Squidward	Oh, boy.
Squidward	Hey, SpongeBob, top this one.  Hey, Little Squidward, what's gray and ugly and has six arms?
Squidward	Well, you can't play music with a piece of paper!
Squidward	What do you mean you can't?
Squidward	No, I don't wanna see it again! Just give me that paper.
Squidward	Oh, dare, dare!
Squidward	Everything must go! Well, that's the last of it.  I've given you everything but the shirt off my back.
Squidward	Okay, okay, uhh, helicopter!  Gentlemen, start your engines. I'm flying! Oh yeah, I'm flying! I'm flying! That's right, that's right, here we go now.  I'm flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying...  ...flying.  Wait, more impressions. A guy throwing a piece of paper on the ground!  A guy stomping on the piece of paper  I'm a guy who traded everything he owns for a...
Squidward	Just where I always seem to be on a nice sunny day.
Squidward	Oh, really.
Squidward	I'm not sure. But I feel I might be coming down with a dreaded illness.
Squidward	Squid's disease!
Squidward	Well, I, I better go break the news to Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	Wonderful.
Squidward	But...
Squidward	SpongeBob.  Turn around, please.
Squidward	Yes.
Squidward	Because I find this all so very inte...  ...resting.
Squidward	So, you're telling me to go home?
Squidward	Oh, no. What happened to you?
Squidward	Oh yeah howdy. That's too bad it had to end. Finally.
Squidward	Let the madness begin.
Squidward	Uh, excuse me, Mr. Agent, sir. While we're waiting, perhaps I could direct your attention to-- oh, the many code violations you'll find  if you turn this way. It's a death trap.
Squidward	Why don't you go bother Sandy?
Squidward	Anything for my fans.
Squidward	Yes, isn't it?  Next? Whoa!  Plankton!
Squidward	Here you go, folks. Enjoy my world famous Fricassee.  Grandma!
Squidward	Ok, I admit it! I admit it! Butbut what's the big deal?  Ow!
Squidward	No!  Living the dream! ()
Squidward	Present!
Squidward	Oh, sure thing, Mr. Krabs! I'll get right on that, never.
Squidward	Whoo... priceless.
Squidward	GAH!!! DAH! DAH! DAH!
Squidward	Are you serious? Is this a dream?
Squidward	A dream wrapped in pain. I don't know whether to smile or pout.
Squidward	What!?
Squidward	You're kidding me, right!? We're performing at a retirement home!?
Squidward	Ok, two, three, four...
Squidward	Well if this concert is anywhere near terrible as the other ones, then it's gonna be my last!  What the...Electronics Outhouse!? Good bye!
Squidward	Yeah...I've never thought I get to perform for so many fans!
Squidward	Uh oh...
Squidward	What do you mean you can't?
Squidward	But nothing. I'm going home. Now put some cash in my hands so I...
Squidward	Get your hands off me!  OWWWW!!!!
Squidward	It's getting really cold out here and I'm four hundred miles from home it will appear! And my feet are hurting oh dear I fear this tentacle-itis is pretty severe!
Squidward	Well it looks like they could help you figure it out...
Squidward	Oh, forget the name. Look at the ridiculous outfit. What is that? A pair of briefs?
Squidward	Just as the essential oils were kicking in.  Hey! I'd appreciate some peace and quiet.  How dare you scoot away from me. I'm scolding here.  Would you two for once act your age!  Fine! Act like infanture hold-ups. See if I care. I'm returning to my grown up lifestyle. So keep it down!
Squidward	Is it full?
Squidward	Oh, yes, sirreenice and empty.
Squidward	What's going on here?
Squidward	Krusty Krab!
Squidward	I'm on it.
Squidward	Enough's enough!  It's time to end this madness! Let's put this freak show on ice!
Squidward	Paranoid much?
Squidward	SpongeBob! SpongeBob! Open up!
Squidward	About the danger that lurks around every corner!
Squidward	Um... sure. Whatever.
Squidward	Uh huh. What else you got?
Squidward	-Alright already! We've been through this! Are you going to teach me how to get revenge on my attacker or what!?
Squidward	"""I promise not to use karate only for protection and not for revenge."" Or whatever..."
Squidward	I'm sure I can break one little twig! Hiiii-YAH!.
Squidward	Alright...  HIYAH! This isn't working! My assailant was twice as tall! And shoulders were twenty times as broad! The burrows of his brow with the size as biceps!
Squidward	Please Sandy! I'll do anything!
Squidward	That's it! I am outta here! This is a no good waste of my time!Hey! I'm doing it! I'm blocking the acorns!
Squidward	Yeah yeah, that's great, thanks. But I have some business to attend to!Heh heh heh... What's this? Do I find myself on this dark and scary street, yet again? We'll just see what happens! This time!
Squidward	Hah! Feel my wrath! How's your uncle!
Squidward	Whatever! I'm still a karate master!
Squidward	Okay already! I get it! What? Wait a second! Am I under arrest?
Squidward	I don't care if you were. The customers are about the snap!
Squidward	Hey, you're blocking my light.  SpongeBob.
Squidward	Toupe? You mean hair?  How do I look?
Squidward	Would you pipe down!?
Squidward	Boo.
Squidward	Ha Ha Ha Ha. This is the most perfect. What a couple of hopeless babies. I really should stop. But Im having too much fun. (goes in SpongeBob's house) Ha. It's almost too easy.
Squidward	Hey! MoistBob DripPants, you mind?
Squidward	Hah hah hah. Well, that's a first for you. An unsatisfied customer.
Squidward	Remind me again, is that good news or bad news?
Squidward	I was busy, trying to forget about this place 'till you woke me up.
Squidward	Sorry, all out of polish.
Squidward	Whatever.
Squidward	You can believe in whatever garbage you want to. Just do it away from me. Now, run along and wash Krabs' undies.
Squidward	Oh, yes I am.
Squidward	SpongeBob, we have no customers today! Ergo, we have nothing to do! No matter what that buffoon wants you to think!
Squidward	That does it!  I have had it with this ridiculous ruse!  Using fear to prey on a feeble mind!  Even SpongeBob doesn't deserve that!  Enjoy spooking the witness, eh Krabs? Well, we'll just see how you like it.  Roar! See? I can dress up as a convincing Yeti Krab too!
Squidward	What?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Hmm? Who's that?
Squidward	Oh, yeah.
Squidward	How many times do I have to tell you... Keep..  Off...  My... ... Petunias?!
Squidward	Well, I hate the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more.  Please come back and be the fry cook again.
Squidward	Whatever.
Squidward	Late? We're gonna be there fifteen minutes early!
Squidward	Well, see, you have point A , where you start, and then there's point...  point... I don't even know what I'm talking about!
Squidward	Huh.
Squidward	Straight line, point A to point B. You're still not getting it.
Squidward	Krusty Krab. May I reluctantly help you?
Squidward	What?! He gets to go home and take a bubble bath?! That's my thing!
Squidward	What do you think? SpongeBob's in one of his moods. He failed his boating exam...again.
Squidward	Okay.
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	It is!
Squidward	I SAID NOT TO TELL ME!  You're ruining my perfect afternoon. I'm spending some quality time with someone who's very important to me.
Squidward	GO AWAY!!!
Squidward	Ahh! What are you still doing here?
Squidward	What? Do you want me to call your supervisor and tell him you're just standing around?
Squidward	Friends, friends...
Squidward	SpongeBob, I have something to ask you.
Squidward	What? What are you... Oh!  You always were a big kidder, huh?  Mailman  guy?
Squidward	That's me!
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	Who is this?
Squidward	Will you tell Larry I wanna talk to him?
Squidward	Um, no. The.. They always seemed a little sporty for me.
Squidward	You know, earlier today I met a jerk who said he didn't like clarinet music.
Squidward	What?! You don't need that glop!
Squidward	So, are we still on for tonight? Sevenish?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Friend?
Squidward	Aww!
Squidward	: Well, that's what Mr. Krabs makes me call it. It's really just a Krabby Patty that costs more. And SpongeBob wears a different tie when he makes it.
Squidward	: I told you, it's for executives only! And you aren't even dressed like an executive! I could of course sell you  the official Krusty Krab business tie for only 10 dollars.
Squidward	: Here's your glasses.
Squidward	Oh, what now? Too much weeing. What is...
Squidward	You missed a spot.
Squidward	Is this toilet paper we're sitting on?
Squidward	I'm going home.
Squidward	Well, this is more like it. You've been holding out on us, Mr. Krabs. You old devil.
Squidward	Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Squidward	I was riding that? What about those delicacies I was eating?
Squidward	I don't want any hair on my chest.
Squidward	I would, but what's the point? There's no one to make the food.
Squidward	Alright, alright! Calm down, everybody! I'm here to take your order!
Squidward	Hey, lady!
Squidward	I'm not worried about them, I'm worried about me! I'm allergic to snails!
Squidward	That's it!! I'm calling the Bikini Bottom officials so they can deal with it!
Squidward	That's it. I'm done.
Squidward	Oh, this has got to stop!
Squidward	No he doesn't!
Squidward	Didn't you see today's newspaper?
Squidward	What? Do you think that games grow on trees?
Squidward	No, you couldn't. You would be incapable.
Squidward	Whoopee. Do tell.
Squidward	O?
Squidward	Butterin' than the different game?
Squidward	Yeah. In crayon.
Squidward	"Might I suggest ""garbage""?  What?"
Squidward	Both!
Squidward	Uh-huh.
Squidward	Well, if the only way to get out of jail is to roll a six! And I can't roll if I'm in jail! Just how am I supposed to get out of jail?! Grrr!
Squidward	Oh, this game doesn't make any sense!
Squidward	Huh? Oh. Hmm...
Squidward	Oh boy! Snacks!
Squidward	Okay, I'm going outside.
Squidward	"Oh, I get the rules alright! The rules are that it doesn't matter what anybody rolls! You can just make up whatever it means!  So, I could just roll the dice and say, ""Automatic Winner!"""
Squidward	Anything to get out of this game! Thanks, Officers!
Squidward	Well, why don't you clean the... uh...
Squidward	Alright, alright. Umm... Ring everything one more time.
Squidward	I don't know. Why don't you just, I don't know, see how many things you can flush down the toilet.
Squidward	This is a completely irresponsible thing to do!  But I must admit, it looks amazing!
Squidward	That was funny. It almost looked like Mr. Krabs' safe. You know. The one with the secret Krabby Patty formula inside?
Squidward	Well, I order you to go get it!!!
Squidward	Eew!! Yuck. It's so unsanitary. Can't believe I'm doing this.
Squidward	Alright, you've been down here longer than me. Which way?
Squidward	We need to get up there!
Squidward	AHH!!! Leapin' lampreys! They're biting me!
Squidward	Silencio.
Squidward	Why is the diagram shaped like a giant sewer snake with an arrow point to its stomach?
Squidward	Snake food!
Squidward	Just my luck.
Squidward	Nothing, there is never a sale.
Squidward	Where's he going?
Squidward	WHAT?!
Squidward	What are you... Whoa! You've been working out.
Squidward	And you know why it was a great day? Because Krabs never even showed up.
Squidward	Huh? I just got my slippers on!
Squidward	Ah-ha!
Squidward	I know it's a stupid question but is there any ice cream left?
Squidward	Oh, SpongeBob, do you have one of your precious thumbs-up for me? I would just love to get one.
Squidward	SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
Squidward	Oh brother.
Squidward	I didn't win anything.
Squidward	There's only one explanation. I'm still in my bed and I'm having a nightmare! [] Wake up! (x3) []
Squidward	"Yup. I'm still dreaming [] Hello, there. Are you enjoying my dream?  I heard you like your patties ""Ground"" []"
Squidward	Gaining speed, increasing thrust, raising nose, air pressure on tentacles, stray tables in right position, and liftoff!
Squidward	Oh, what did you numbskulls do with the trash?
Squidward	Ohhh...let me get this straight. You saw a TV commercial of Nick Fishkins saying he would buy your home and without meeting him or signing anything, you believe your homes have been sold? Now doesn't that seem weird, even to you?
Squidward	Uh, no, no, you don't wanna do that!
Squidward	And they don't speak English! Uh, the Fishtraps only speak...German!
Squidward	Yes, a big rock band with like eight people and all sorts of musical equipment so there's only room for musicians!
Squidward	Uh, please, vould you speaken-zee English, I need za bractize!
Squidward	She's shy...well, I must be going! Mein wifenz calling me for zupper! She is a fine Gutenchef of Fudenschlop!
Squidward	Oh, sorry, dude, no room. This place is, like, filled with band members and musical instruments.
Squidward	I'll be right back!
Squidward	I don't have children!  I mean- I mean, yeah, yeah, outside please!
Squidward	That's it, I'm done!
Squidward	He flips the houses, you dimwits! He buys houses then resells them for a profit! He flips houses for a living!
Squidward	Who's that driving away?
Squidward	Ow! Ach du lieber...
Squidward	I have arrived.  What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?
Squidward	Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward	What are you doing behind the counter?
Squidward	I'll catch you, SpongeBob!  Whoops.  April Fools, you little sausage!  SpongeBob! I was just kidding! Cmon, cmon. You all know I was just kidding Right?
Squidward	Why are you wearing that hat?
Squidward	SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there!  SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this!
Squidward	I'm just trying to say that I'm...  There's gotta be an easier way to do this.  Well, aren't you going to open it?
Squidward	Mother?  All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and...
Squidward	Really?
Squidward	No.  Way.
Squidward	And that's why my depression is award-winning.
Squidward	And what about me?
Squidward	"What thewhat?!  ""I-I-I tender my resignation from this greasy establishment. Too long have I toiled under your iron claw. Now I am freefree to live my dreams of being a ballet dancer, ha-ha, and the first chair clarinet in the Bikini Bottom Orchestra, ha-ha, and I am going to finally publish my mystery/thriller novel: 'Dial D for Doily!"""
Squidward	Totally out of character.
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	Of course it does. What do you think Krabs uses as filler?
Squidward	Huh?  Hmm.
Squidward	Because I don't care.
Squidward	I'm gonna give you a number, of contusions!
Squidward	Oh, ratfish!
Squidward	Additionally, who cares?
Squidward	Alright. Hey!
Squidward	Well, at least we have plenty of food while we're stuck out here.
Squidward	Maybe I could just eat the corner of the lettuce.
Squidward	Everybody's a critic.
Squidward	Yes!
Squidward	Probably because it's pay day.
Squidward	Well, I guess that solves that problem.
Squidward	Thank you! Thank you! Just doin' my job as captain protecting my crew.
Squidward	I don't want to be captain! I don't want to be captain!
Squidward	It's all a bunch of made up baloney.
Squidward	I said I would, only if there was a Tooth Fairy, and since there isn't a Tooth Fairy, I will never have to eat a bucket of chum.
Squidward	Oh, that's a good one.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Aliens from Mars! It's an invasion!
Squidward	NO! Now please fall and get seriously hurt!
Squidward	That's it! I'm gonna clobber you two!
Squidward	Hey, Superdorks! Your turn to take out the garbage.
Squidward	Hmm?
Squidward	Oh, look at that. I think I've left my oven on.
Squidward	Oh, I don't think we're going to do that.
Squidward	Too long have I suffered living between you two ninnies! But now, now as Doctor Negative, I shall finally exact my exquisite revenge!
Squidward	"It wasn't an insult, Mr. Krabs. It was aaaa tribute. Haven't you ever heard of ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery""?"
Squidward	Already forgot about it.
Squidward	Here here.
Squidward	There will be no hugs! Get away from me, you monstrosity!
Squidward	Dim lights.  Sleep, little Squidward, catch some winks everything and everybody clearly stinks
Squidward	It is not great!  I've got an audition with the Bikini Bottom Philharmonic Orchestra tomorrow morning, and I'm a nervous wreck!
Squidward	Home.
Squidward	What was thatSpongeBob? Patrick? You're inside me?! Oh, how did this happen? Get out of my mind!
Squidward	Ihuh? Oh.
Squidward	How's that?
Squidward	Krabby Patty? Krabby Patty?
Squidward	We have to get out of here! These children are menaces!
Squidward	Ew.
Squidward	Ooh.
Squidward	Hey, where are you going?
Squidward	Uh, wait for me. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me. Wait, wait  Hey, hey!
Squidward	"Maybe you should change the name of this place from the Krusty Krab to ""SpongeBob's Place!"""
Squidward	Oh, admit it! You're jealous of SpongeBob!
Squidward	Oh boy... Huh?
Squidward	"""SpongeBob's Place?"" What in the ocean?  Pardon me. Don't mind me!  Just trying to get in my own front door!"
Squidward	I hate people! I'm still that way! La, la, la, la, la, la, hey, hey, hey!
Squidward	Why I do raise seahorses!  Well, I don't know if I call myself international playboy!
Squidward	Wait a second. Hurt each other? Oh, I'm gonna enjoy seeing this.
Squidward	Ah! Sea spider!
Squidward	I said...
Squidward	Once again, I'm asking, what are you doing?
Squidward	What are you yammering about?
Squidward	Oh, it was just luck! Dumb luck!
Squidward	Wow, I can't believe it, but you two sub-geniuses were right somehow. I can't be broken. I'm indestructible! I am shatterproof! Watch this.
Squidward	Oh, perfect.
Squidward	"Oh, I know it's not. Your name is ""Hey."" What's your name?"
Squidward	Ha! Germs can't hurt me. Nothing can hurt me!
Squidward	Oh, what are those ninnies going on about now? I can't hear you! Just shut up and watch me!  Nahhey!
Squidward	Ow...
Squidward	Can we lower the volume, please? I can't work with all that racket going on!
Squidward	I thought I... Wha?
Squidward	Oh, boy.
Squidward	Don't give me any of that! How can you two possibly make all this noise just blowing bubbles?!
Squidward	Beginners? What could be more simple than blowing a stupid bubble?  Here's your 25 cents!  Watch and learn.  Uhh... wait, wait, wait.  One more time. Here. Wait.  Uhh... Just a mere warm-up.
Squidward	Now that's a bubble!
Squidward	Hello, my friends. You are looking at a...
Squidward	You don't know how lucky you are.
Squidward	It's a feeding frenzy, sir. And SpongeBob's not back from his break.  What?
Squidward	Well, that was more of SpongeBob than I needed to see.
Squidward	37 Krabby Patties! Fast!
Squidward	This is Leo, sign of the lion. Hear him roar... The typical Leo has the voice as pleasant as a dental drill. If you have a Leo in your family, I suggest you move out or buy earmuffs. Leos often grow up to be junior high school vice principals! My prediction for Leo in the 12 months ahead, everyone you know will turn one year older! I'm Squidward, your Nicktoon astrologer, saying my powers are as real as any other psychics, and I'm a cartoon.
Squidward	Say 'Happy Birthday' to Taurus the bull. Taurus is the most clumsy and oafish of all zodiac signs. They tend to break delicate objects just by walking past them. If no one ever invites you to their house you're probably a Taurus. From now on, only buy things made out of rubber. My prediction for Taurus in the coming year: you will eat a wide variety of different foods.  I'm Squidward, your Nicktoon Astrologer, reminding you no matter what your sign, you owe me five dollars.
Squidward	Those patties aren't going to cook themselves, SpongeBob.
Squidward	Then bring that patty here now!
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	It's SpongeBob's fault.
Squidward	No!
Squidward	You are-- It's part of the promotion I mentioned earlier. You'll be wearing  hats now. You're gonna take the orders and then you're gonna make them!
Squidward	What is it?
Squidward	I forgot to tell him how to make change! Oh!  Sponge...  ...Bob.
Squidward	Everything will be fine. There won't be any customers today anyway. He'll probably just stand there, bored.  SpongeBob, bored.
Squidward	What's that supposed to mean? I'm very busy.
Squidward	Must... re...  ...lax!  Look at yourself. You're losing your bluish glow. Stop worrying so much. Now, repeat after me. You will not go back to the Krusty Krab.
Squidward	No, I am not finished with those errands and I never will be. So quit checking up on me!  I know what you're up to.  Forcing me to come back here every time you mess up!
Squidward	Aha!  I know you're in here.  What?  He's heading back to the Krusty Krab! I'll beat him there!  I've got you now, SpongeBob!
Squidward	Yes, SpongeBob. I am finished with those errands.  I guess I want to take my place back at the cash register. I really do.
Squidward	Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time, understand?!
Squidward	I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
Squidward	I don't have your money!
Squidward	Is that what he calls it?
Squidward	What a nut job.
Squidward	No, we are not there yet! And do you know how I know that?  BECAUSE THE BUS HASEN'T MOVED YET!
Squidward	No! It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do. We can't have that! We have seniority, right?
Squidward	Okay, this is it, SpongeBob. Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform.
Squidward	Don't bother, only a fool would wear that.
Squidward	Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob?
Squidward	What the?
Squidward	SpongeBob, I told you to stop calling me!
Squidward	What the...?  Oh, like that's gonna make anybody feel bet...  ...ter.
Squidward	Well, I guess it's safe to go in, now.
Squidward	Two Krabby Patties, no pickles.
Squidward	Please come again. When I'm not working. Next.
Squidward	Well, thanks for stopping by.
Squidward	I'm not taking an order for a bubble.
Squidward	Here's your hair care product, sir.
Squidward	And?
Squidward	Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style!  And if there's anything else I can do, please hesitate to ask.
Squidward	He made me provide excellent service!
Squidward	Let's get this over with so I can go home and play my clarinet!
Squidward	To go home?
Squidward	It's a little itchy. What's this thing made of?
Squidward	The only thing I'm making is for the exit.
Squidward	Oh, well, that's too bad. I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one.
Squidward	But, Mr. Krabs, I had no idea. I can explain!
Squidward	Kill him?
Squidward	Yes, hello, doctor? Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times?  Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him?
Squidward	I forgot to tell you, there's a part two to your gift.
Squidward	Great. Uh, let me see it.
Squidward	Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list.
Squidward	You're going to be wearing a salmon suit?
Squidward	[] I can't breathe.
Squidward	Sunset?
Squidward	Yeah.
Squidward	Five... four... three...  two...  o-o-o-one... Well, at least I was able to make his last few hours meaningful.  I am such a good person.
Squidward	Yes! That's what I've been waiting for!
Squidward	Because the pie you ate was a bomb!
Squidward	"I always thought the most important rule was ""why do today what you can put off till tomorrow?"""
Squidward	What now, Mr. Krabs?
Squidward	Okay hold still.
Squidward	Well, if Moron Theater's over, I'm just going to take a look at this monster.  That's the monster?
Squidward	It's kinda cute.
Squidward	Okay, that's enough!
Squidward	SpongeBob! What are you doing in here?
Squidward	Get out!
Squidward	Who turned on the AC?  Mr. Krabs! Oh, no, this is terrible! Who's gonna sign my paycheck?
Squidward	Some people have no taste in headgear.  Huh? Babies too?  Excuse me, miss, but where is everybody getting that horrid headwear?
Squidward	So you're selling Krabby Patties, eh, Plankton?
Squidward	Huh? What?
Squidward	Huh?  Ow!
Squidward	So is he an anemone or Plankton?
Squidward	Seriously?  Aren't you overreacting a bit?
Squidward	Still out of Krabby Patties.
Squidward	Wait. You mean we can just take this stuff off?
Squidward	Actually, I have four feet.
Squidward	SpongeBob, you know this guy?
Squidward	Ow, my neck.
Squidward	Whoa! Whoa!
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	[embarrassed] It happens when I'm nervous.
Squidward	You know what this needs? A little interpretive dance!
Squidward	Pretty Patties, Pretty Patties!
Squidward	Your forehead.
Squidward	The fan stopped--
Squidward	Look, surf boy! Are you gonna teach us how to surf, or do we have to stand there and stare--
Squidward	Fun?! How could playing with one of those over-sized hair dryers possibly be fun?
Squidward	SpongeBob, this is the final straw. I am going to move so far away, that I will be able to brag about it. I would-  I would rather tear out my brain stem, carry it into the middle of the nearest four-way intersection, and skip rope with it, than go on living where I do now.
Squidward	Hello?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	This place is even better than I expected!  302, 303, and 304. Beautiful.  And not a pineapple in sight.
Squidward	"Ahh. I think I'll take my bike today.  I'm my own man.  Now these neighbors know how to live.  Intensive. Hmm I bet they won't have-  They have it!  ""Canned Bread""! This town is great!  I would really be impressed if it had---  ---an interpretive dance academy?!?  Yeah! It's even better in a group!  This town is perfect.  A clarinet trio?!  Aah, another great day.  Oh look! Everybody's on their bike today.  It just gets better and better!  All together!  I sorta don't feel like playing my clarinet today.  Yep, this is great. They might as well rename this town ""Squidward's Paradise."" Or perhaps too much paradise.  SpongeBob?  Oops.  Leaves. Just getting the leaves."
Squidward	Like this!
Squidward	What is it?
Squidward	Freedom! Woo-hoo!
Squidward	Oh look, it is I, SpongeBob, out here in the open.
Squidward	Oh, brother.
Squidward	Excuse me, coming through, out of the way.
Squidward	Go away before I harm you bodily!
Squidward	SpongeBob, take this stuff down immediately!
Squidward	SpongeBob, no.
Squidward	My self-respect. My sanity. My lunch.
Squidward	Ahh, morning already? Oh, boy!  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. Wait. Oh, I see a great Christmas photo op. Could you move in a little? Say Santa Claus.
Squidward	Oh, gee, I, uh, you know I...
Squidward	Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!
Squidward	Yes, it is I, Santa Claus. Ho, ho, ho...
Squidward	Don't do that again.
Squidward	Alright! I'm Santa.
Squidward	Oh, well, uhh, you see, I'm not really...
Squidward	Uhh... let's see what Santa has for all you good people.  Think fast, Santa. Gifts for good people. A-ha! A bowl of mashed potatoes for you.
Squidward	Well, at least it's over.  Huh? What's this?
Squidward	Of course you are. Bye now.
Squidward	Oh sure, right! Whatever.  Like that'll ever happen.
Squidward	What's she blabbering about?
Squidward	How about this?  Huh?
Squidward	We can't, uh...because...
Squidward	SpongeBob! Do you have to knock so loudly?
Squidward	Oh, this is great! You and I can go turn him in! And then I'll get so much sleep, I'll be gorgeous!
Squidward	Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away!  Now look what you've done!
Squidward	That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
Squidward	I never said that.
Squidward	No, no, they're not. Whew.
Squidward	Boy, I'm glad all that's over!
Squidward	You wished for gum?
Squidward	That's not what I meant!
Squidward	But why have we been turned into fruits?
Squidward	I think I fancy a stroll around the park.
Squidward	Ow! SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!
Squidward	Les quit fooling around, where's my Krabby Patty?
Squidward	Be quiet, SpongeBob!
Squidward	Hello. You've reached the house of unrecognized talent. Please start after the
Squidward	The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba?!?!
Squidward	I gotta drum up a marching band fast! Drum... haha... band humor.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	No, SpongeBob, that's a chorus line.
Squidward	Well, this is our last night together before the show. And I know that none of you improved since we began...  ...but I have a theory. People talk loud when they wanna act smart, right?
Squidward	Well, you did it. You took my one chance in happiness...and crushed it! Crushed it into little tiny, bite-size pieces. I really expected better of you people. I guess I'm a loser for that, too. Don't bother showing up tomorrow. I'll just tell them you all died in a marching accident. So, thanks.  Thanks for nothing!
Squidward	That would be my band!
Squidward	Alright, everybody.  Let's get this over with. 1, 2, 3, 4...
Squidward	No, you won't! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs?
Squidward	Don't hold back.
Squidward	But I thought you liked the night shift.
Squidward	You don't remember? It was all over the news.
Squidward	The Hash-Slinging Slasher!
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Except he wasn't a sponge!
Squidward	Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance.
Squidward	Oh, here you go.  Next, the phone will ring and there will be nobody there.  And finally, the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over.  Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead!  Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand..
Squidward	Are you sure you want to know?
Squidward	Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke.
Squidward	"""And the lights will flicker on and off."" Just like the story. I get it."
Squidward	SpongeBob, I'm not doing this.  Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights,  and the phone,  and the walls will ooze green slime!  No, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing?
Squidward	At last you understand! We're doomed!
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	Lilac.
Squidward	Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom.
Squidward	Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image.  And I'll go down in history, someday. And there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world.
Squidward	You're looking at him.
Squidward	Well, art is not all fun and games.  It's a lot of hard...  ...work. OK. First, repeat after me: I have no talent.
Squidward	Whatever. Ok. Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. Or should I say circle one.  Am I going too fast for you SpongeBob?
Squidward	Gimme that.  There is nothing artistic about leapfrog.  What are you doing, now?
Squidward	It's beautiful!  I mean, this isn't a sculpture.  A good sculpture takes... more time. You can't just sculpt Willie-Nillie. You've got to go by the book. Follow the rules.  Otherwise, you'll never get passed Amateur Hour, here. Besides, you've got the nose wrong.  There, now it's art.
Squidward	Well, what are you doing here?
Squidward	How about this one? I call it: Bold and Brash.
Squidward	Fortune.
Squidward	Yeah, no problem. You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off.
Squidward	Aww, c'mon SpongeBob. You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty.
Squidward	Really.
Squidward	Ah, ah. Wait, wait. Let me help. Let's start with the circle again.
Squidward	Forget about the book.  Ha! Look at all this mess SpongeBob.  What do all these little bits of paper make you want to do?
Squidward	Right.
Squidward	Here you go, buddy.
Squidward	Thank you for choosing the Krusty Krab. Here's your change.
Squidward	Ah, yes! Our meager restitution.  Ah, the sweet smell of payday.  Huh?
Squidward	Well, I'm not paying that cheapskate Krabs one cent, and I suggest you do the same.
Squidward	And you want to keep working here, right?
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	Soon, he'll realize he needs us more than we need him. We are workers united!
Squidward	Alright SpongeBob, now listen up. I'm going to have to teach you how to strike. First, we must get rid of our uniforms,   I want you to throw your hat on the ground like so.  Now, stomp it into the dust! Your turn, SpongeBob.
Squidward	Okay, pay attention, SpongeBob. Now we're going to make picket signs. This is a very important part of striking.
Squidward	"SpongeBob, it's ""unfair,"" not ""funfair""!"
Squidward	Almost. A little more to the right. And... perfect.  Attention, people of Bikini Bottom! You have been cheated and lied to!
Squidward	as long as they can get their instant gratification.
Squidward	I gotta beg Mr. Krabs for my job back and put an end to this nightmare!
Squidward	I'm glad you saw it our way, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	Wow! Patrick, you saved me!
Squidward	Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo.
Squidward	SpongeBob? No, no, stay back!
Squidward	No, no! Get away!  Oh! I'm ruined! I'm... I'm... I'm... I-I feel great! Thanks, SpongeBob! You're a real friend!
Squidward	Grrrrrryehhhhherrrryeh!
Squidward	This can't be happening to me!
Squidward	I thought you two were my best friends.
Squidward	Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop. I'm gonna go get some more.  Why don't you just stay here and chat?  I should just walk away right now.  What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today?
Squidward	Ohhhhh, my back.
Squidward	Co-Cashier?
Squidward	I'd like my view to be a little less yellow, if you know what I mean.
Squidward	What's that supposed to be some kind of stupid secret code?
Squidward	Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in?  Why, you should be begging me to join!
Squidward	Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!
Squidward	Well... this is the end.
Squidward	Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!
Squidward	Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there.
Squidward	Yeah.  Now, uh, if you'll excuse me...  All right... What shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?
Squidward	Oh. Then how about the soup?
Squidward	Give me that!  Can I have something to eat?
Squidward	Can't you say anything else but no?
Squidward	Abra.
Squidward	Good morning, flowers.
Squidward	SpongeBob, where's my order?
Squidward	In case you've forgotten, here's how things work. I order the food, you cook the food, the customer gets the food.  We do that for forty years and then we die. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me, what do you say?
Squidward	Folks, we have a minor situation going on in the kitchen.
Squidward	Hey, who left this bowl of onions here?
Squidward	Here you go, sir. A King-Size Ultra Krabby Supreme with the works, double batter fried  on a stick.
Squidward	Look at them eating that garbage.  It's . They're sickening. I hate Krabby Patties.
Squidward	Don't encourage them! They'll never leave.
Squidward	I've never had a Krabby Patty.
Squidward	Try one of those radioactive sludge-balls you call food? Next, I suppose you'll want me to go square-dancing with Patrick.
Squidward	Quit it.
Squidward	Oh, puh-lease! I have no soul!
Squidward	No.
Squidward	No...
Squidward	Why... this Krabby Patty may be the most...  Horrible! Putrid! Poorly prepared! Vile!  Unappetizing! Disgusting excuse for a sandwich, that has ever been my displeasure to have slither down my throat!
Squidward	Does this look unsure to you?
Squidward	Uhh, SpongeBob?
Squidward	Well, why don't you just, uh, leave it out here, in case they come back.
Squidward	Hmm, honey...  What? Oh... I have got to get my hands on a Krabby Patty! And no one's gonna stop me!  There it is!
Squidward	Uhh, I forgot my...
Squidward	No, no, wait... it's not what you think. Th-this is a big misunderstanding. You've got to believe me, I... Listen, I am telling you...  You better listen to me, SpongeBob!
Squidward	My thighs?
Squidward	They probably ordered a lifetime supply of bubble soap.  Huh? A brand-new television?
Squidward	Wow, I never thought of it that way. That's really something. Can I have your TV?
Squidward	Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!
Squidward	Morons.
Squidward	Yes! But those sound effects: the avalanche, the, the, the...
Squidward	The noises! How are you two making those noises?
Squidward	What do they want with me? What did I do?  Obviously, I've violated some new box kicking law!  Look officers, everything's okay. I won't do it again!
Squidward	Heh-heh, I guess this is okay. I mean, it's not really about boxes.  I give up.
Squidward	"Don't ""Where's what, Squidward?"" me! Where's the tape recorder?"
Squidward	No, no. Don't mind me, I'm just here to observe.
Squidward	"Hello, what's this?  ""This plaque is to commemorate the brave pirates who gave their lives to keep this box safe from the Robot Menace. Lest we forget... Ohh!  I've got to find that button quick!  It's got to be around here somewhere. I don't see anything! It's just an empty box! Maybe it really  their imagination. Oh... get it together, Squidward! What are you saying? I mean, do I really believe that if I sit here and pretend to drive a race car that I'm suddenly going to start hearing noises?  What the...?  It actually works! I can't believe it! Ha-ha! Oh boy! This beats TV by a long shot!  Whooo-hoo-hoo! This is the most fun I've ever had!"
Squidward	Whatever. Five dollars, please.
Squidward	I'm shakin'. Heh. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
Squidward	What do you got there?
Squidward	Is that Mermaid Man's belt?
Squidward	You stole it?
Squidward	I'm walking towards the phone!
Squidward	Hello. I'd like to speak to Mermaid...  What the? What?  Ow!
Squidward	I said now!
Squidward	N-n-n-n-no.
Squidward	SpongeBob, will you just face facts? You've shrunken everybody in Bikini Bottom! You've got to go to Mermaid Man!
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Thanks, but no, thanks, Major Stupidity. You and General Nonsense over there will have to fight without me.  Got 'em Both.  Grrrrrrrr!
Squidward	Patrick, go use your own bathroom.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	I most certainly am not!
Squidward	Now there's something I'd actually like to see!  Nothing wrong with getting a front-row seat, I suppose.  Ahh. What's this?  Wha... I... no!  What are you doing? You're supposed to be knocking each other's brains out!
Squidward	You're Patrick.
Squidward	I'm SpongeBob! You're Patrick!  Now, what are you going to do?  Patrick, why didn't you hit SpongeBob?
Squidward	Okay, fine? You want a fort?  There. There's your fort! Now...
Squidward	Not if I crouch down. I mean, you didn't even give me a chance to crouch down.  See? Down here, I am perfectly...
Squidward	Take that... I got you... Yeah... oh, I got you... oh, take that... Whoa, I got you that time... Oh yeah...  Incoming!
Squidward	What?
Squidward	That's the useless junk for scene, uhh, 28.
Squidward	Well, this is just great. Now we've got no crew to make the commercial.
Squidward	Where's that coming from?
Squidward	Well, SpongeBob? Are you just going to stand there like a half-wit, mouth agape? Or are you going to fill these peoples' orders?
Squidward	Hey!
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, can we please go now?
Squidward	What?
Squidward	You're saying something!
Squidward	What?!
Squidward	I'm out of here!
Squidward	Where have you been?
Squidward	Yeah...uh-huh. Ya know, that reminds me, there's been something I've been wanting to say to you since the day we met... Goodbye. Next time you see me, this town will be eating out of the palm of my hands!  Spare change? Spare change, ma'am?
Squidward	Yes?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Ok, but just until I get a job. one day...two days tops.
Squidward	No, no, no. You've already...well...
Squidward	Thank you.  SpongeBob, you forget to turn out the light!
Squidward	I can't drink that.
Squidward	No! No! It's already contaminated by the bad lemon! It won't work!
Squidward	Condensed soup from a can? Disgusting! Now you've ruined my appetite! Go fetch me something to read!
Squidward	This isn't my show. SpongeBob, the remote control is broken! Get over here and fix it!
Squidward	I agree, sir.
Squidward	Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.  I'm done with my shift, Mr. Krabs! And let me just say, there will come a day when I will make something of my life and I will never have to set foot in this grease trap again!
Squidward	You are no great shakes, Squilliam Fancyson. Anyone can be a big shot in a hick town like Bikini Bottom.
Squidward	That's right.
Squidward	This is serious.
Squidward	Alright, listen up. Men, Squilliam Fancyson will be here in twenty minutes. Therefore, we need to turn the Krusty Krab into a fancy restaurant as soon as possible.  Patrick, what are you doing here?
Squidward	Then you'll be our chef.
Squidward	Yes, they do that! Now listen, Squilliam is on his way and you have less than twenty minutes to become a fancy waiter, so read this.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, you gotta take them out of the...  Holy fish paste, what is that?!
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Empty your mind of everything that doesn't have to do with fine dining. Fine dining and breathing.
Squidward	How did you do all this?
Squidward	SpongeBob, I can't thank you enough for all you're doing!
Squidward	And I need you to wear this.
Squidward	I am so very sorry! I don't know what has gotten into that...
Squidward	Is that true?
Squidward	I'm not wearing your hat on my nose, I'm waiting for #17's order!
Squidward	How did you...?
Squidward	"It was rated ""R.""  Arr! Because it's... about... pirates."
Squidward	No, wait, SpongeBob!
Squidward	I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy!
Squidward	We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how?
Squidward	Shut up!
Squidward	No, that's not Mr. Krabs. That's Robot Krabs.
Squidward	SpongeBob, let me handle this.  Where's Mr. Krabs?
Squidward	We don't think; we know.
Squidward	Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob.
Squidward	Go get the toaster.
Squidward	Uhh
Squidward	The guy who won't even spring for a doormat!
Squidward	Ouch, I think I picked up a tick!  Plankton?! What do you want?
Squidward	GeezSpongeBob, I hadn't thought of that! You're right! I quit.  Eh, a bit industrial, but I can make it work.  You call this a kitchen? We should start by tearing out this wall so the chef is visible to his adoring fans!
Squidward	So I guess the proof is in the pudding, then, isn't it?
Squidward	Nice try, tiny Cyclops. You won't get Grandma's delicate mix of seasonings and spices that easily, but preparation cannot be rushed. Each batch must simmer for exactly 24 hours.
Squidward	Give that back, please! Thank you!
Squidward	Hat.
Squidward	I'm the Deadly Fisherman!
Squidward	Oh believe me, it's worth it.
