Mr. Krabs	Well lad, it looks like you don't even have your sea legs.
Mr. Krabs	That sounded like hatch doors!  Do you smell it? That smell. A kind of smelly smell. A smelly smell that smells smelly.  Anchovies.
Mr. Krabs	Whoa! Batten down the hatches, Mr. Squidward!  Were taking on water, Mr. Squidward!  I want my mommy, Mr Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	That was the finest fast foodsmanship I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants! Welcome aboard!
Mr. Krabs	Hip-hip!
Mr. Krabs	Our delivery Squid will bring it right over.
Mr. Krabs	This here's an advanced patty-control mechanism.  Here you can see our automated money-handling system. Don't touch!  These are high-quality beverage temperature devices. Imported.  This here's a prototype liquid transfer machine.  And most importantly,  You get your state-of-the-art condiment-dispersal units. Now, are you gonna buy something or just stand there cause there's a standing fee.
Mr. Krabs	The money is always right!
Mr. Krabs	"No, you dumb bunny, it says, ""Hello, my name is Patrick."""
Mr. Krabs	Nice try, Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	"Oh, yes, you do! No world means no money! Now, go save the world, or you're fired! ""[runs back to the Krusty Krab][Squidward grumbles]"
Mr. Krabs	No, this is my one millionth dollar earned! Every crab's goal in life is to make a million dollars, and now I got mine! Congratulations, sir! You have just given me my one millionth dollar!
Mr. Krabs	Congratulate yourselves, lad! A captain's nothing without his loyal crew! I mean, a crew like you  comes around maybe once in a lifetime! And to reward you for making me millionth dollar, I'm taking you on a trip.
Mr. Krabs	Better than that!
Mr. Krabs	For a second or two, I thought she was a goner!
Mr. Krabs	And remember, we don't leave until we catch that clam and rescue me dollar.
Mr. Krabs	I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward.
Mr. Krabs	Now, I think we understand each other. Nobody eats until I get my millionth dollar back.
Mr. Krabs	Come on, fresh meat!  Keep thrashing! He likes it!  Come on, boy! Closer. Closer. Almost there.  That's it!  Aha! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Look, boys, I finally got it!  I finally got me millionth dollar.
Mr. Krabs	It wasn't easy. Old Blue Lips is quite the fighter. So, eventually, we settled on a trade.
Mr. Krabs	Thank you, sweet pea. I see you got creative with the bran today.
Mr. Krabs	Coral, eh?
Mr. Krabs	Ha! Old? What was I thinkin'? I ain't old. Huh?
Mr. Krabs	No! No! I ain't old like you! I ain't old! I ain't old!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, boys, hangin' out?
Mr. Krabs	Uhh, yeah, course I know it!  Uhh... uhh...
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party?
Mr. Krabs	So, what kind of hot rod will we be cruising in tonight?
Mr. Krabs	We used to beat people up for saying things like that! Everything's all topsy-turvy now.
Mr. Krabs	Any port in the store! wait a minute. This is a Laundromat.
Mr. Krabs	Not yet.
Mr. Krabs	Do you really wanna know if I can feel it?
Mr. Krabs	Lame! You're nerds! Geeks! Creeps! And babies!
Mr. Krabs	Panty raid? You're talking about girls, right? Girl girls?
Mr. Krabs	Now this is more like it!
Mr. Krabs	Mother?
Mr. Krabs	Yes, Mommy.
Mr. Krabs	Yes, Mommy.
Mr. Krabs	You're not to make another Patty until that one is sold. Understand?
Mr. Krabs	You two would have never have lasted in the navy. Let's see how bad you are.  No...no...  Stay...  Thatta girl! There, there.  See? Good enough to eat.  Oh, look, an ambulance. Now, then.  SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Everything ok, doc?
Mr. Krabs	I'm not Eugene Krabs, I'm, uhh, Harold. Harold, uhh...  Flower!
Mr. Krabs	Blec! Why does it smell so foul?
Mr. Krabs	You have me word as a sailor.
Mr. Krabs	Of course, you do! You know what that means, right?
Mr. Krabs	Great!
Mr. Krabs	Sorry about the confusion.  Free toy?
Mr. Krabs	No expense spared for my valued customers.  Look at all those happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, it's just a bad dream. I'll wake up soon.
Mr. Krabs	Your luck just ran out.
Mr. Krabs	Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you.  Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go.
Mr. Krabs	Look, Squidward, money!
Mr. Krabs	You heard what I said about the money?
Mr. Krabs	Davy Jones on the jib! Do my ears deceive me? Is it really the first day of summer? Is it?
Mr. Krabs	Er, uh... I mean, uh... the children!
Mr. Krabs	What? But that's impossible.  What about the money? I mean uh... uh... what about the children?  I guess summer isn't coming this year.
Mr. Krabs	True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do.
Mr. Krabs	Nice to meet you, Monroe.
Mr. Krabs	Eh... that reminds me. I forgot to give you these coloring books/liability wavers!  Everyone who hands theirs back gets to meet the one and only Krabby the Clown!
Mr. Krabs	I don't know. Be entertaining.
Mr. Krabs	Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!
Mr. Krabs	All right, here you go!  Hey kids! Uh, thank you all for coming! Thank you. Eat plenty of Krabby Patties!  Ah, Krabs, you've done it again!
Mr. Krabs	Huh?  Oh, hey kids.  Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh.
Mr. Krabs	Fall in for inspection! All right, you two...  Hat and uniform seem to be in order.  Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass.
Mr. Krabs	Attention, Krusty Krab crew! All hands report immediately!
Mr. Krabs	But he was persistent!
Mr. Krabs	But thousands of failures have made him crafty, so keep your eyes open!  You'll never know what trick he'll use to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.
Mr. Krabs	You sure you don't want a Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs	Plankton! You knew I would never distrust a dollar!
Mr. Krabs	And now for the chaser!
Mr. Krabs	Ah, you and what army, bug?
Mr. Krabs	Well, you might as well forget it. The formula is locked away in me safe, and I'll never give ya the combination.
Mr. Krabs	I'm telling you, you won't be able to handle the truth. There are some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes.
Mr. Krabs	I'm warning ya...!
Mr. Krabs	Hey. Why ain't you running?
Mr. Krabs	Curse you, Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Ghosts? Ha! I ain't afraid of no ghosts! Every sailor knows a ghost won't come near a fella as long as he's wearing his spotted neckerchief...  And his dried-up sea leprechaun.  And a bit of gold never hurt.  But to be on the safe side, I'm also wearing me pants in a melvin knot,  got me shivering timber brace,  and the hairs on the back of me neck are taped down.  And I'm all wrapped up in a suit of anti-ghost armor. And if none of this stuff works, I've got me secret weaponthe specter deflector!  So just try and get me, you ghosts! Bring it on.
Mr. Krabs	I'm warning you!
Mr. Krabs	You'll never get me!
Mr. Krabs	No!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, come on boys, I'm hip! I pulled my share of pranks when I was your age. Had me some laughs. That's what we did tonight, right? We had a good laugh. Come on, laugh with me.  Uh, any particular reason you boys are naked?
Mr. Krabs	Don't mention it.
Mr. Krabs	What the...?  ...The Chum Bucket open 23 hours? So that little piece of flotsam Plankton thinks he can stay open longer than me, does he?
Mr. Krabs	All right, everybody. The Krusty Krab is entering day 3 of non-stop service! Let's give it up for day 3!  Yee haw, day 3!
Mr. Krabs	Quit your bellyaching, Squidward; you don't hear SpongeBob complaining, do you?
Mr. Krabs	Eww! A spider bug.
Mr. Krabs	"Kick it into high gear! We've got a big order!  I'm counting on you, boy. I need you to raise that spatular.  Yeah! And I need you to say, ""Team Krusty Krab!"""
Mr. Krabs	Day 23! Give it up for day 23!
Mr. Krabs	Day...  anyone know how many days it's been? I've lost track.
Mr. Krabs	Sure, I said I'm worried that...
Mr. Krabs	and here's the grill.
Mr. Krabs	No, a psychiatrist.
Mr. Krabs	No, seriously. Get back to work!
Mr. Krabs	It's where I hide me treasure.  Catch!  Let's get that chest to the office, boy, pronto!
Mr. Krabs	Arrgh!  It's me first tattoo.
Mr. Krabs	"Me shipmates. The toughest bunch to ever sail the briny deep. There's ""'Ol Iron Eye"", , and ""Mutton Chop"", , me, , ""Torpedo Belly"", , and ""Lockjaw Jones""."
Mr. Krabs	Oh, really?  This is me navy cadet uniform. Prepare to eat your words 'cause I haven't put on more than a couple of pounds.  Ok, maybe I'm a bit bigger. But I'm still the toughest of the tough. Go ahead, lad, give em a punch.
Mr. Krabs	No!!
Mr. Krabs	It's when a crab gets too fat- um, er, outgrows his shell. It falls off!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah.
Mr. Krabs	No, you barnacle brain. Not your silly metaphor. You, in me shell. It gives me an idea. You can go to the reunion and pretend to be me.
Mr. Krabs	Heh heh, say that ain't half-bad.
Mr. Krabs	That'll do SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	I've created a monster.
Mr. Krabs	He did it.
Mr. Krabs	'Atta boy.
Mr. Krabs	Oh no.
Mr. Krabs	C'mon lad, let's go home.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, poor suckers. At least my shell will grow back.
Mr. Krabs	Arrgh, me back!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, me back. Well, here goes another useless attempt to sleep on me mount less, lumpy mattress.  Huh, that's queer. Me mattress seems strangely cozy and butter-like...
Mr. Krabs	All my money was in that mattress.
Mr. Krabs	Is there money in it?
Mr. Krabs	Look at you, Plankton. Once again you've fallen flat on your back in a pathetic attempt to steal me formula.  Though you've tried and tried, you haven't had the smallest nibble of my delicious formula.  And you never will!  How do you sleep at night, no wonder you're a complete failure?
Mr. Krabs	Scoundrel! You'll have me formula when you pry it from me lifeless claws!
Mr. Krabs	So, uhh, how much is this going to cost me?
Mr. Krabs	Ah, run along. Make things ship-shape for my victory celebration. I've got to get to the courthouse early. There's only a few free parking places.
Mr. Krabs	He's lying! Bah!
Mr. Krabs	Really?
Mr. Krabs	How's it coming lad?
Mr. Krabs	No! No-no! No!  Daddy's got ya. Daddy's got ya. Daddy's here.  A little glue, a little tape. It'll be right as rain.  Daddy didn't forget ya.
Mr. Krabs	Must...open...case.
Mr. Krabs	It's...  It's just his lunch. Or is it?
Mr. Krabs	Thank you, SpongeBob. I was foolish not to accept your help from the beginning.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! You're 15 minutes late.
Mr. Krabs	Refund?! What's wrong with it?
Mr. Krabs	Okay, boy, why don't you tell Mr. Krabs what's wrong.
Mr. Krabs	That's me boy!
Mr. Krabs	What? My machine has arrived?! Oh, let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in.
Mr. Krabs	At a quarter a pop, this thing will pay for itself in no time. Which reminds me, step up boys. First one's free.
Mr. Krabs	My work here is done.
Mr. Krabs	No, no, Mr. Squidward. Thank you.
Mr. Krabs	What? Why?
Mr. Krabs	I took the liberty of turning your paycheck...  ...into quarters. Just in case you wanna... oh, I don't know, do laundry or  buy a soda or... something.
Mr. Krabs	That's funny. Last time I checked, you were a cashier.
Mr. Krabs	Here they come, lads.
Mr. Krabs	Who wants to know?
Mr. Krabs	Buy the Krusty Krab? It's not for sale. You know, I may not make as much as your fancy-schmancy-migger restaurant chain, but it's the blood, sweat, and tears of a hard days work. It's not about the mon...  Holy sweet mother of pearl! I like the way you think Blandy. But it's gonna take a lot more than a suitcase of cash to buy the Krusty Krab from me.
Mr. Krabs	That'll be fine then.  Here you go. Now gimme gimme gimme gimme.  Whoo-ha! See ya around.
Mr. Krabs	So long, boys.
Mr. Krabs	Whatcha up to?
Mr. Krabs	Actually, I was hoping you and I could do something together.
Mr. Krabs	Retirement ain't all it's cracked up to be. So, I'm the new bus boy.  Uhh, ok son, you're starting to creep my out.
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I don't need Carl's silly rules.
Mr. Krabs	What's going on around here? Where's SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Automated cash register? Noo!  Hey, Carl, what have you done to me restaurant? Processed Krabby Patties? Computerized registers?
Mr. Krabs	Rules! Here's a rule for ya: people can't eat stain glass barstools!  I'll show you automated!
Mr. Krabs	Pleasure's all mine. Now get out of me restaurant.  We did it, boys.  The Krusty Krab is ours again. Ya know, in a fit of maniacal rage, I may have destroyed the restaurant, scared away all our customers, and forced us into bankruptcy because I returned nearly every penny I sold this stink heap for, but it was all worth it. And I got back the love of my dear friends.
Mr. Krabs	What's wrong, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, this is worse than I thought. After all, money is the ultimate source of joy.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, money. You're always there for me.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, look at the time! So sorry to have to rush off. Bye!  Whew, that was a close one.
Mr. Krabs	But, Mommy, you shouldn't be spending my inheritance...I mean, since you told me you wanted a hat, I went out and I dug one up.
Mr. Krabs	Wonderful! I'll stay open late so ye can have a nice, romantic dinner. Run along, make yourself pretty. SpongeBob, you're working late tonight. No overtime!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob...
Mr. Krabs	But, mommy...
Mr. Krabs	All you love is thieving and conniving. Now, stop trying to get the formula out of me mother.
Mr. Krabs	Mommy!
Mr. Krabs	Yes, mommy.
Mr. Krabs	Please don't marry him, mommy! Don't marry this bad, bad man! I don't want you to!
Mr. Krabs	So, what do ye say, lad?
Mr. Krabs	I closed early for your movie. Where are the paying customers? You promised a full house.
Mr. Krabs	Oh. That. Well, can't we talk about this?
Mr. Krabs	That two bucks is comin' out of your paycheck!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, don't worry about that. We've got Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Why you talkin' funny, lad?
Mr. Krabs	It's like riding a bike. You never forget!  Uhh... I'm gonna help ya!  If you learn to make a Krabby Patty again, your life will be back in order.
Mr. Krabs	Don't talk like that!
Mr. Krabs	Three cheers for the return of our master fry cook, SpongeBob! Hip hip...
Mr. Krabs	What in blazes is going on in here?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what's the hold up?!
Mr. Krabs	There you go, Squiddy.
Mr. Krabs	Come inside.  Isn't it beautiful?
Mr. Krabs	Ok, Squidward,  man the front desk.
Mr. Krabs	This elevator is for guests only. Take the employee elevator.
Mr. Krabs	He can be as unreasonable as he wants! The plaque, Squidward, the plaque!
Mr. Krabs	Quit? You can't quit.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers... Squidward?!
Mr. Krabs	Oh... here's your room key.
Mr. Krabs	Well, you got your stinky sandwich. Now eat it.
Mr. Krabs	What is it, Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	So you're all taken care of?
Mr. Krabs	Let's get outta here, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	You don't need me to chew your food for ya? Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine? Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?!
Mr. Krabs	Not at these prices! Forget hotels! This hospital rack is where the money is!
Mr. Krabs	Are you sure you wouldn't prefer a room on the ground floor?
Mr. Krabs	I knew that. How could you think I wouldn't know that? What are you gonna be, 12?
Mr. Krabs	Now, now, don't snap your mizzenmast. Everything is all set. Why, I've already got the party favors--bubble wrap!  This year's gonna be a blast.
Mr. Krabs	While I plan the party, I want you to buy Pearl's present.  Here you go, boy.
Mr. Krabs	Now remember, nothing's too good for me little Pearl. I wanted to give her nothing, but she's too good for that. Now follow her around and see what she likes. You know, do some detective work.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah. Well, we've got the decor covered. Now how about entertainment? Pearl wants some boy band called 'Boys Who Cry'.
Mr. Krabs	It's almost time for the party to start!
Mr. Krabs	Who wants cake?
Mr. Krabs	Pearl, come back.
Mr. Krabs	Boy, how much is all this costing me?
Mr. Krabs	Don't push your luck, boy.
Mr. Krabs	Use another spatular.
Mr. Krabs	Alright, what's going on in  ...ooh... don't you have any shame, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, that sounds excitin'. Let me have a go at it.
Mr. Krabs	Huh, impressive. Well, let's see that thing impress me even more by bringing in more customers and more money in me pocket.
Mr. Krabs	Go to em. Go now, boy. Go before I lose all me customers.
Mr. Krabs	No!  I'll save ya, money!  Gotcha. What do you heartless brutes think you're doing?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, SpongeBob, I got a new job for ya.  X marks the spot of the Eugene Krabs Memorial Wishing Well
Mr. Krabs	All right, Squidward, you can go back to the register.
Mr. Krabs	See ya in 8 hours.
Mr. Krabs	Uhh, not yet. But I'm sure if you believe strong enough, and dug deep enough, everyone's wishes will come true.
Mr. Krabs	Good morning, SpongeBob! Let's see what ya got.  Boy, it's heavy. Must be a lot of money.
Mr. Krabs	The what?
Mr. Krabs	You mean she stole that boat.
Mr. Krabs	Eh? I wonder what form of trickery is up that miniature cyclops' sleeve this time.  Alright, Plankton, I don't know what you're trying to pull on me, but I'll tell ya right now, it ain't going to work.
Mr. Krabs	Criminy, Plankton, you ever heard of spring cleaning?
Mr. Krabs	Come on, this has got to be a joke, right?
Mr. Krabs	Now that's an employee who follows orders.  What in blazes is that noise?
Mr. Krabs	Eh, we'll see about that.  I'll just put this in here for safekeeping. You here that, Plankton?! Join your other friends from the past.  Now nobody's getting to see anything. Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. It's just cosmetic. He thinks he can take us out. But we'll show him. We're gonna out-fake the faker. Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it. I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. Yup, we sure whipped him this time. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Plankton's turned over a new leaf.
Mr. Krabs	Dance or you're fired.
Mr. Krabs	Plankton! You may have fooled everyone else, you might have even fooled yourself, but you ain't fooling me.
Mr. Krabs	Bubkes! If there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula.  You know you want it.
Mr. Krabs	Sure it is. And this isn't the formula that you don't want. Come on, eh? Eh? Oop. Too slow. [chuckles]
Mr. Krabs	I never thought I'd see the day. What happened to the invertebrate I used to know? Plankton!
Mr. Krabs	Listen, uh, I just wanted to...you know...apologize for my behavior today. Wasn't right what I done. And I realized I hurt the feelings of, uh, someone I care about. You still there?
Mr. Krabs	I figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over.
Mr. Krabs	And just to prove it to you, I want you to have something.
Mr. Krabs	Come on, take it.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, come in, boy. And bring your friends in, too. They look hungry. [uses key to open]
Mr. Krabs	But how do we know you haven't become one of those voracious flesh-eaters?
Mr. Krabs	It's... for his own good, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! SpongeBob! Just put me out of my misery.
Mr. Krabs	Well, that went better than expected.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here.
Mr. Krabs	That's enough banter on my dime.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?
Mr. Krabs	Out you go, boy.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over.
Mr. Krabs	Not a problem at all, me boy.
Mr. Krabs	Look boy,  I brought your spatuler.  C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it!  Enjoy your vacation, boy!
Mr. Krabs	You don't have to.  Your accumulated vacation time is used up.  The union can't fine me, anymore.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Happy?
Mr. Krabs	Time to go home, boys.
Mr. Krabs	No but's.
Mr. Krabs	Hello, Squidward. Neptune's trousers! What's gotten into you?
Mr. Krabs	Patricia. The most beautiful sound I've ever seen. SpongeBob, do we need any more help down at the Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs	Just keep your eyes on the customers, Mr. Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	That's a 7, Patricia.
Mr. Krabs	Get back to work, you gold-bricking freeloader. Hut two, hut two, yah, yah! And don't come back 'til all the patties are krabby.  Well, now that we're alone, how would you like to be my date Friday night to a...
Mr. Krabs	Well then, you're fired. Uhh, if anybody needs me, I'll be in my office for, I dunno, the next 20 years or so.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.
Mr. Krabs	I've got a better idea.  A buffet fit for a king.
Mr. Krabs	All free?!!?  Nobody eats in me restaurant for free, king or no king!
Mr. Krabs	What are you going on about? Bikers?
Mr. Krabs	This'll be great. Those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot. Then they can fill up on delicious Krabby Patties then they can beat you up again.
Mr. Krabs	Don't you want to spend any money?
Mr. Krabs	What? Why not?  All right, boy, it's done! You're gonna suck the whole cup down your gullet if you're not careful.
Mr. Krabs	Grr. I better get to the bottom of this.  Ah! A new store!  On my block! Taking my customers.  Pearl.  Me own flesh and blood. How could you do this to your papa?
Mr. Krabs	Why I wouldn't give them a cent.
Mr. Krabs	Then how do you explain this?
Mr. Krabs	Oh!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, let's see, let's see. Ah, there you are.  Plankton, I think I found the kitchen.
Mr. Krabs	All set, Plankton?
Mr. Krabs	Of course we do.
Mr. Krabs	No kidding.
Mr. Krabs	Buy one?
Mr. Krabs	Uh, ok.
Mr. Krabs	No way, pipsqueak. This gold mine is mine.
Mr. Krabs	Hmmm.  Hey, you're right. This ain't half bad.  This is amazing.
Mr. Krabs	Now what are we going to do?
Mr. Krabs	You said it.
Mr. Krabs	I'm on the case.
Mr. Krabs	Get out of the way, boy!  Me building's been condemned, boy. We got ourselves a nematode infestation.
Mr. Krabs	Boy, you saved me barnacle the way you put the run on them nematodes.
Mr. Krabs	Yep. And since you did such a good job, we wanna make it up to you.
Mr. Krabs	I'm not paying for that!
Mr. Krabs	Suspicion doesn't hold a candle to birthday wishing.
Mr. Krabs	You might as well blame me, SpongeBob.  There was a time when Plankton and I were best friends.
Mr. Krabs	Darn tootin'. Hey, barnacle brains, I think you owe Plankton an apology.
Mr. Krabs	Money?
Mr. Krabs	"Listen up, Squidward! Because this is where it gets juicy. It all started in a place called ""Stinky Burgers"". It was the only place to get a burger. Kids loved Stinky's.  And Stinky loved the kids."
Mr. Krabs	Did you see that fat stack of loot? I bet if we made a better burger, we'd make a fatter stack of loot.  But who has the ability to make such a burger? Who has the skill?
Mr. Krabs	T'was me first dollar I ever earned, and was also the start of a beautiful, romantic relationship with money.
Mr. Krabs	Give me that!
Mr. Krabs	What I was saying was...  You'll regret this one day!  And he always did.
Mr. Krabs	First, I'll rule their stomachs and then...  ...their money!
Mr. Krabs	Malarkey.
Mr. Krabs	You've help me mom and me through some tough times. It would be an honor if you'd be the first to try our delicious burgers.
Mr. Krabs	You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in the burger.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no you don't! This is my turf.
Mr. Krabs	Woo-hoo! My recipe was, is, and always will be the best.
Mr. Krabs	Really?
Mr. Krabs	Well, I'll be cooked in butter! It's Jim, the Original Fry Cook!
Mr. Krabs	"Your ""Best Employee Ever"" award! SpongeBob! Sweep up this mess while Jim and I catch up."
Mr. Krabs	You're right, boy. I appreciate you, Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Three cheers for the world's greatest fry cook... SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	He thinks you're taking his job, so he's run off!
Mr. Krabs	What now?
Mr. Krabs	These sideburns aren't real.
Mr. Krabs	So, you'll stay?
Mr. Krabs	Whoa. You don't look so good, laddie.
Mr. Krabs	What is it now, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Now, look here. Your work is starting to affect me profits. You need to get some shut-eye. Why don't you get yourself a night light?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! Help!  Help me flip these patties! We've got growling stomachs out there!
Mr. Krabs	Inadequate!?! I'll have you know, the staff of the Krusty Krab take a solemn pledge, to show up every day in a week clean and disease-free.
Mr. Krabs	He's just doing his job, SpongeBob! He's a bottomfeeder, remember? See? The little feller licked me clean! I'm cured! And he'll clean the Ick off any surface! Even Squid!
Mr. Krabs	Alright!
Mr. Krabs	Just making sure the Krabby Patty formula is safe.  Plankton hasn't tried stealing the formula in over a month. He must be planning something big.
Mr. Krabs	Shh! Okay, okay! You can be a spy. Just be quiet.
Mr. Krabs	Krabs here. Go ahead.
Mr. Krabs	A stamp.  This is the most elaborate scheme ever. Keep on him, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	Well, find him, lad. I'm not paying you to goof off with Patrick.
Mr. Krabs	Merciful Neptune!  Man your battle stations!
Mr. Krabs	Ha ha ha! Huh?  No!
Mr. Krabs	You see, we had a bet. Plankton's been trying for 20 years to steal me formula, and he's never done it!
Mr. Krabs	You're on.  So, through a series of events far too elaborate to go into right now, we flawlessly assumed each other's lives; and I beat Plankton at his own game.  And destroyed his place of business!  Now pay up.
Mr. Krabs	I thought you might say that, so I decided to turn this into a contest. The employee who learns more names wins this.
Mr. Krabs	The boy and I just thought we'd stop by and check on our convict.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, you mean that brochure. Well, that was the prize. The brochure. It was taking up too much room in me drawers, you know. It's your prize.
Mr. Krabs	What'd you do?
Mr. Krabs	Well, you can clean the salad bar.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sheesh.
Mr. Krabs	All night?
Mr. Krabs	Well, start cooking some Krabby Patties...
Mr. Krabs	Oh, lighten up, Squidward. 'Tis harmless tomfoolery.
Mr. Krabs	Because I'd hate for a certain living arrangementmeaning yoursto interfere with said money spending.  What the barnacles?  SpongeBob! Why is your bed in me office?
Mr. Krabs	Your parents?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, oh, I...I'm sorry. I didn't know...
Mr. Krabs	Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Heat costs money! There are two ways to get on my bad side, boys. I don't like kids playing in me yard, and nobody but me touches me thermostat!
Mr. Krabs	Someonetouchingthermostat.
Mr. Krabs	"The temperature stays at 62 degrees"""
Mr. Krabs	Just put those patties back when you're done.
Mr. Krabs	I'll take that.  Brilliant idea to block the exit with your body, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	You've gone too far this time, Plankton. You can pound me employees,  try to destroy me restaurant, but nobody messes with me thermostat.
Mr. Krabs	And it's time for The Krusty Krab to return from its vacation.
Mr. Krabs	Yup, Squidward. you really outdid yourself for the new decor. Where did you get the fountain?
Mr. Krabs	Well, it looks great, lad. And it didn't cost me a dime.
Mr. Krabs	Well actually
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, a limousine.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, it's that Krabby Patty.  What are you doing with that rotten piece of meat, boy?
Mr. Krabs	All right, take a seat.
Mr. Krabs	Well done, boy. As a reward for your valiant effort, I'll only charge you 25 for the patty. Employee discount.
Mr. Krabs	Uhh... well, they might be.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBoy, me Bob! Come in. Come in, right this way, laddie! Have a seat anywhere, but not on these beautiful priceless boots.  So you want to get paid?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, uhh, oh, well, his name's not important, but he was famous, all right, don't you worry.
Mr. Krabs	You've got a deal.
Mr. Krabs	Nonsense, Squidward. That squeaking is money to my ears. I mean, music.
Mr. Krabs	That fry cook's making me a fortune. What could be the problem?
Mr. Krabs	Well, I don't... uhh... I don't... uhh...
Mr. Krabs	Ah, quiet money. Silence and money.
Mr. Krabs	Hold it, boy! It's not the end of the world.
Mr. Krabs	I didn't do it!  Ohh, heh-heh, can I help ya?
Mr. Krabs	Huh?
Mr. Krabs	Stop it!    Oh, oh, can't you hear it? Yes, I did it! I did it! I took the boots! They're here, under the floorboard! Oh, please, make it stop! It's the squeaking of the hideous boots!  I'm sorry, but I can't take the infernal squeaking no more!  The deed is done.
Mr. Krabs	Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need, just me and my darling daughter Pearl.
Mr. Krabs	"Did someone just say ""free""? In my restaurant?!  What's the problem here?"
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob? What are you doing with those patties?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Enjoy your meal. Let me know if you need anything else.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah. Wait a minute...
Mr. Krabs	Oh...  If I could talk to money, how great my life...  Parlez vous Francais? Hable Espaol? Ou-yay eak-spay ig-pay atin-lay? Mm-hmm. Maybe this will make you talk. Talk! You're being too hard on the little guy. You can talk to me. I'm your friend.  I would give anything to talk to money. Anything!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, yeah, skip the lecture. I want what's coming to me.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, it's a nickel. What were you doing in my belly button, little fella?
Mr. Krabs	Don't worry, darlings. Soon you'll be rejoined with all your friends.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, I did it. I can talk to money.  Go ahead, say hello.
Mr. Krabs	You have any friends you can invite over?
Mr. Krabs	What?
Mr. Krabs	Unfortunately.
Mr. Krabs	I'm not listening...
Mr. Krabs	Dutchman, you cheated me. Take this horrible curse away!  I want a refund.
Mr. Krabs	Now, now, I'm sure we can sort this out.
Mr. Krabs	I have to admit, that patty was yummy, though it sits like a rock when it lands in me tummy. But I've got me a fry cook, and he's always on time.
Mr. Krabs	Ahoy, Squidward.  Good Neptune, SpongeBob. what has gotten into to you, son?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, you just drove away Gene Scallop. Don't you know our lives depend on his review?
Mr. Krabs	Hey, no, wait! Wait!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, just making a few cosmetic changes.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! I'm sorry, little girl. Of course you can have his autograph for $5.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, that reminds me, Squidward. I need you to unpack these boxes.
Mr. Krabs	Don't worry, Squidward. I got something else lined up for him.  Step right up, folks! Take a ride on The Krusty Sponge Fun Train. Tickets are only $1.98. Seatbelts not included.
Mr. Krabs	Okay, Tell them I'll be right out.
Mr. Krabs	I'm glad you asked. We got SpongeBob drinking straws  coasters  bibs  and me personal favorite, SpongeBob ice cubes!  Aww.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah. I want you to start using them instead of the other ones.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, go away, please, I'm busy.
Mr. Krabs	It's a... It's a Spongy Patty.
Mr. Krabs	Eh, hang on a second there, judge. That wouldn't happen to be a SpongeBob gavel you're using?
Mr. Krabs	I love a happy ending.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what's the meaning of this? [SpongeBob inspects the plate and then notices the spot]
Mr. Krabs	Should've never left you alone with a lit blow torch and me roller skates. But, since I've removed all the welding equipment from the premises, there's no-ho-ho chance of that happenin' again, right? Now, get to work.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, boy, that can't be good.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I'll clean your platter!  Come here, you!
Mr. Krabs	Next time, wear a disguise without your initial on it.
Mr. Krabs	Ahem!
Mr. Krabs	You'll never catch me, Plankton! Never! Oohanother penny! Come to papa! Now were we doing?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, Gesundheit.
Mr. Krabs	Right after the party. The piata party.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, come into me office.  What's wrong, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn't last even one day in the wild. This is your natural habitat.  This is your wide open range.  These are your amber waves.  And thisoh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule! That's better than nasty old jellyfish, right, SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	And I'll see you at work first thing tomorrow morning.
Mr. Krabs	Ah, we don't need those losers anymore! I'm turning the restaurant in to one of those fancy froufrou places, where they charge big bucks for itsy-bitsy portions!
Mr. Krabs	Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs	I don't know! Some kind of bean paste or something.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, well you see those were out of stock.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, well, you know, until I come up with the money I owe, I'm afraid you'll be staying with these nice gents.
Mr. Krabs	Is it money?
Mr. Krabs	Okay, now I'm scared.
Mr. Krabs	Well Mr. Squidward, all's well that end's well. I got me poor disgusting old clientle back, and rich disgusting new clientle to boot!  I'm back in business!
Mr. Krabs	Hello there. Welcome to the museum! That'll be three dollars.
Mr. Krabs	Did somebody say untold riches!?
Mr. Krabs	Hurry up Squidward, that money ain't gettin' any younger.
Mr. Krabs	Bet there's some loose change in here!
Mr. Krabs	Well that's just splendid boy! A land where it rains money! More than you can spend. With fives and tens and fifties and I'll want to be your friend.
Mr. Krabs	I'm Eugene. I like money.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! You told me the streets were paved with gold. Now that street light better be a 600 dollar diamond or else.  Ah hold still, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	These are me hounds to me pants.
Mr. Krabs	Are you kidding?! I've just got here!
Mr. Krabs	But what about the treasure? It was really great!
Mr. Krabs	I don't wanna go back!
Mr. Krabs	Not yet. First, I have to know, can you pay for it?
Mr. Krabs	It's your bill.
Mr. Krabs	You're gonna pay, one way or another.  All right, Patrick, if you're not gonna pay for your food with money you're gonna pay with hard, physical labor. I want you to swab the latrine.  I'll be back in a while to check up on you.  Bottom-feeding...
Mr. Krabs	Figure it out!
Mr. Krabs	Good, 'cause if you mess this up, you'll never eat another Krabby Patty again!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob is 13-1/2 minutes late for duty. I hope for his sake this means he was in a horrible accident.  Well, looks like I was right about the accident part.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, hey, kids?  Uh, well, there's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the ballroom.  SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	That's nothing! My Great-Great Grandpappy Krabs invented the greatest thing since loose change! The spendthrift billfold system! Allow me to demonstrate.  Hey SpongeBob, how about a raise?
Mr. Krabs	Step right up, folks! Just a dollar to stomp on old Dead Eye Plankton!
Mr. Krabs	Quiet, Squidward, I'm brainstorming! Ooh, ooh! What if instead of bringing customers to the Krusty Krab, we could bring the Krusty Krab to the customers?
Mr. Krabs	Tell me all about it. Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me!
Mr. Krabs	Gold? Heehee!
Mr. Krabs	Hurry up and get in there, boy! Patties need flipping.
Mr. Krabs	If I were you, I'd get as far away from me as possible-- Idiot Boy!
Mr. Krabs	What he means to say is, no, we haven't.
Mr. Krabs	You do?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, Squidward, don't forget your retirement gift.
Mr. Krabs	Aye, the best in the business. Now get flipping.
Mr. Krabs	Where's SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	Hey, where you going? Don't leave me! Please! I'm beggin' ya! Look. I can make him handsome again. Watch!  See?  He's getting handsome. It just takes a little  effort, just a little  elbow grease. Please! Come back!
Mr. Krabs	Jellyfish?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! These wretched hags-I mean, these little lovely ladies-are obviously here to eat. So let's sell 'em- I mean, serve them some delicious Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs	Who are you with your tight lips, raised eyebrows, and conservative clothes?
Mr. Krabs	She closed us down! I'm ruined!  Curse ye! How did it come to this?
Mr. Krabs	That's it! A secret Krusty Krab.!  And I know just where to open it.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, yeah...
Mr. Krabs	There's an old saying, lad. What doesn't kill ya... usually succeeds in the second attempt.
Mr. Krabs	Here's me little money maker.  Are you gonna make me lots of money today?
Mr. Krabs	You've got the job!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! What's the meaning of this? Your station looks horrible. Take some pride in your work, boy! Look at your cousin Stanley, for example. Spiffing up his workplace with meaningful photos of the customers!
Mr. Krabs	What? You didn't lie to me just so your cousin could get the job, did ya?
Mr. Krabs	They solve mysteries.  Now go solve the mystery of why you didn't get the job!
Mr. Krabs	Ah, it goes in like steel wool, but comes out like an angel from heaven.
Mr. Krabs	What does that mean?
Mr. Krabs	What?
Mr. Krabs	I mean why couldn't I have just walked along and found it? I have legs too you know!  How about a little music.  Okay, okay, get a grip Krabs. Just concentrate on driving.  Okay, getting all worked up over a little coin.  Ah, it must just be the full moon. Wait a second.  I gotta have that penny!  Good morning, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	And you want to share it with your old uncle Krabs, don't you boy?
Mr. Krabs	Hello, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	Front pockets?
Mr. Krabs	Shoe pockets?
Mr. Krabs	Did you check there?  Uhh?
Mr. Krabs	Darn!
Mr. Krabs	And you're just in time for the grand opening!  Step right up folks, and witness a spell binding tale chock full of adventure, and action, and thrills...
Mr. Krabs	That's right! And the best part is: admission is only one penny!
Mr. Krabs	Of course you can lad! You just gotta give me one penny.
Mr. Krabs	Yes?
Mr. Krabs	What's that? You! You know where!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, I just wanted that penny you found on the street yesterday. Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Krabs	Penny, must have buried it around here somewhere. I'll just have to keep digging.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah!  Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month.  We've got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers.  Do you lubbers have any ideas?
Mr. Krabs	Little Pearly... a star?
Mr. Krabs	That's what I call talent!
Mr. Krabs	For your sake, I hope you're right.
Mr. Krabs	Please deposit 25 cents to continue this call.
Mr. Krabs	Brace yourself!  Huh?  Plankton's destroying the Chum Bucket? Heh, heh, I guess he's finally given up on the restaurant business. Couldn't take the competition.  What is that?
Mr. Krabs	.....but when he steals me customers, then I push back! Gentlemen, to the coliseum!  This reeks of evil. And i'm going to sniff out the source.
Mr. Krabs	You know I'm not one to give out comments likely, I've gotta hand it to you boy,  if you didn't throw those sausages into the audience, we would have been dead meat!
Mr. Krabs	Ahem, perhaps you'd like to speak to our financial expert.
Mr. Krabs	Eh?  Wow, that's all it takes these days, huh? Can you do more?  Oh, my! It's like printing money!
Mr. Krabs	No, boy, you're missing the point. You can't make Krabby Patties with ink and paper. You gotta put your heart in it, boy. Now get back to making them patties the right way and stop acting so dull.
Mr. Krabs	It was National No SpongeBob Day.
Mr. Krabs	Aww, cheer up, boy. It's a whole day inspired by you.
Mr. Krabs	These quarters smell sad. You're not planning on getting a refill with them, are ya?!
Mr. Krabs	Put your hat on, boy! Show some company pride!
Mr. Krabs	"Interesting... Well, what's this about a splinter that Squidward's been telling me all about?  All right, boy, let's see it.  Come on, SpongeBob, it's just a little splinter. I mean, how bad could it...?  Oh, merciful Neptune!  Okay, no problem. No problem.  Problem sol...  Whew. For a second there, I thought I was gonna have to pay you workman's ""compersation."""
Mr. Krabs	Uh, Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Can you spot him, Mr. Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	I haven't seen Plankton in a while. He must be scheming.
Mr. Krabs	He's a thief. Look at the lust in his eye, he's...
Mr. Krabs	Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton's gone straight.  Or maybe scallops will fly out of my pants!  Hold on there laddie, I'm a-comin!
Mr. Krabs	Don't blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty! Now let's go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh one on me!
Mr. Krabs	What the barnacles do you think you're doing?! You're chasing away all me customers!
Mr. Krabs	I've asked you all here, because we all face a similar problem. The problem, a sea star with a nose that's gotten way out of hand.  Now what I want to know is, are we going to do something about it?
Mr. Krabs	Pull up a seat boy.
Mr. Krabs	Listen up boy, any minute now, a truck driver is going to arrive, and i'm entrusting you to retrieve the secret ingredient! And I need you to do this with out any foulups! Understand?
Mr. Krabs	If something happens to that secret ingredient, don't bother coming back to work!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, you were in charge of guarding that secret ingredient with your life!
Mr. Krabs	That's right. And I know exactly how you carried out this little caper.  You obviously set up a decoy to take the delivery. Then when no one was looking, you swooped in, stole the secret ingredient, and spirited it away to the Chum Bucket,  where you sold it to Plankton to make a quick buck.  Don't talk! You can tell it to the cops, 'cause I'm calling them right now!
Mr. Krabs	Well, I wouldn't call it stealing...
Mr. Krabs	What? What'd I do?
Mr. Krabs	Rolling, rolling rolling. Money keeps on rolling.  One more time!  No way, Plankton! You're not getting me formula this time, or any time!
Mr. Krabs	Oh no! How can this be? Boy, front and center!
Mr. Krabs	But we've developed a special recipe for the most discerning Chum lovers. Besides, I locked all the exits until you give it a try. So what do you say?  You like it?
Mr. Krabs	What am I going to do? I can't let Plankton have as much as one single customer!  I just can't afford it.
Mr. Krabs	Look at all that loot!
Mr. Krabs	How's it looking out there, boy?
Mr. Krabs	"""Fishboy Strikes Again?""  Wait a minute, aren't these stories a little less than truthful?"
Mr. Krabs	Off of your duff, boy. You think I spent all last night assembling this printing press, so you could laze around all day? From now on you'll be twice as busy. And I expect you to wear 2 hats. 'Cause along with your usual fry cooking duties, you're my new lead reporter for the new !
Mr. Krabs	: I'm excited about all the newspaper sales, too.
Mr. Krabs	": ""Local Resident Watches Pole?"" No ones gonna pay to read this malarkey! When you write these stories, you've gotta use a little imagination, boy."
Mr. Krabs	": ""Boating Teacher in High Speed Chase!"" I think you finally done it, boy! You've given me a story that'll sell! And sell it has!"
Mr. Krabs	: Make it quick, boy. These papers are selling faster then we can print 'em!
Mr. Krabs	: You're reaching new levels of imagination, boy-o!
Mr. Krabs	: Oh, baloney! You better start feeling right! 'Cause if you don't, you can just kiss your spatular goodbye!
Mr. Krabs	: Come on, that's a bunch of hooey!
Mr. Krabs	: How's it going, lad?
Mr. Krabs	":  ""Krabs Overworks Employees? Reaps Reward? Krabby Kronicle mastermind behind bogus stories pays his tired, under-age reporter pennies while he rakes in the dough?!?"""
Mr. Krabs	Pearl!
Mr. Krabs	Look, I'll stay upstairs in me room and not interrupt.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, hi, pumpkin. I was just setting out refreshments for your friends.
Mr. Krabs	See, you put it on the crackers  and a mamma mia you got-a one-a spicy pizza pie-a.
Mr. Krabs	And the most important one in all, no boys allowed!  Isn't it glorious?  Sweetie, you accidentally locked the door!
Mr. Krabs	Whaddya say, boy?
Mr. Krabs	They what?!
Mr. Krabs	Quiet, boy!
Mr. Krabs	Not zombies, you Barnacle Brain!  Teenagers.
Mr. Krabs	Thats what teenagers do! Do you want this to happen to my house?
Mr. Krabs	You are one-of-a-kind, boy.
Mr. Krabs	Whats taking SpongeBob so long? Im getting tired of looking through his stuff.
Mr. Krabs	And its ice cold, too. You should have been back here in 30 minutes or less!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob?!
Mr. Krabs	Youre welcome, sweetie!  Oh, this is so expensive!
Mr. Krabs	Good word, boy! Don't sneak up on me like that.
Mr. Krabs	Huh?
Mr. Krabs	Could you be a little more specific?
Mr. Krabs	My name is Eugene Krabs and I would like to know if I could interest either one of you in a fresh, delicious...
Mr. Krabs	Either you buy a Patty, or get off me wave!
Mr. Krabs	Careful! You're gonna capsize us!
Mr. Krabs	Locust. Culinary! Oh.  Look, Cashy!  Earrings! Well, Cashy, I guess the Devil's Galley isn't so bad. As long as that Flying Dutchman doesnt appear and stick us in Davy Jones' Locker! But that won't happen, will it Cashy?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman! I didn't mean to spill your groceries!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, yes. I promise on my dear Aunt Sally's false teeth.
Mr. Krabs	No!!
Mr. Krabs	You like it when I comb your hair, don't ya, Cashy?
Mr. Krabs	Cashy!
Mr. Krabs	Sorry about that, SpongeBob. Wont happen again.
Mr. Krabs	Huh?
Mr. Krabs	Big deal.
Mr. Krabs	Ohhhhhh.
Mr. Krabs	What? Those two? Ah, they're harmless. It's all just part of the act.
Mr. Krabs	Eh... sure.
Mr. Krabs	You can do it!
Mr. Krabs	Oh. Heh heh. Now what?
Mr. Krabs	Actually...  It doesn't!  Okay, okay, look. Just...  Hey, where'd they...  Oh, no! Not the...
Mr. Krabs	C'mon, c'mon, wake up!
Mr. Krabs	Goodbye, mon- ... new champions?
Mr. Krabs	Curtain Number 2?
Mr. Krabs	Okay, that's over with, Now why don't you go see if First Mate Squidward needs any help at the register?
Mr. Krabs	Anyway, we got new beverage cups.
Mr. Krabs	Don't you know when you're being ignored?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I, uh, about ten years.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, a correspondence in a bottle, eh?  Ahoy, Eugene. I'm so proud you followed your ol' Grampa's peg leg and became a pirate, that I'll be sailing by for a ship's inspection. That vessel better be well-oiled or you'll be dancing the short plank jig. Happy looting! Grampa Redbeard!  Grandpa Readbeard comin bla, bla, bla!
Mr. Krabs	And for years, I drifted the high seas as a pirate. And booty did abound.
Mr. Krabs	Hm. Not a bad idea, boy. But we're gonna need a first rate crew.
Mr. Krabs	But most importantly, I want you to smell like a pirate.  Very convincing, Patrick. And as me crew, you'll be makin' the Krusty Krab into an imitation pirate ship! Now, let's get this restaurant ready to sail!

Mr. Krabs	Really? Thanks, Granddad!
Mr. Krabs	What are you talking about?
Mr. Krabs	What's going on here?!
Mr. Krabs	What are you two doing?! Get to work! I'm used to Squidward sleeping on the job, but I expect more from you, Mr. SquarePants.
Mr. Krabs	Who told you that?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, it's Mr. Krabs. I've been looking all over for you. You're three hours late for work!  Hello?
Mr. Krabs	Let me see.
Mr. Krabs	Get that disgusting vermin out of me restaurant, pronto!  Blech!
Mr. Krabs	I don't know. I've never been to the old country!
Mr. Krabs	Four hundred and fifty-one, four hundred and fifty-two, four hundred and fifty three, four hundred and fifty four, four hundred and fifty five, four hundred and fifty si...  Ow! No!  Ooh.  I split me nail. Oh, that looks terrible.  Hello? It's an emergency! No, I haven't been biting them!  No! Can you just schedule me in?  Now? A manicure right in the middle of the day?  But what if the guys see me?  Yes, I want my nails to look their best. Be right there.
Mr. Krabs	Eh,  well, not Squidward. [ No, no, him.  Too lumpy.  Okay, okay, you're in charge.
Mr. Krabs	What a sheesh. I'll be back in 15 minutes
Mr. Krabs	The Krusty Krab a filthy mess?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, how do you put this thing together?
Mr. Krabs	Now read this cover-to-cover, and be prepared to put this together at me house tonight.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! I knew I wouldn't have to fire ya!
Mr. Krabs	I was just looking at your employee report card...
Mr. Krabs	Patrick's rock? Whatcha do with it there?  SpongeBob, wait! Get back here, boy!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, you should've said something.
Mr. Krabs	You'll get your hat, but first you have to entice people into the restaurant by standin' right here and holdin' this sign.  That's not too tough for ya, is it boy?
Mr. Krabs	And look. He's about reel in his first customer.
Mr. Krabs	That's enough Patrick!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what's wrong with him?
Mr. Krabs	There's that sound again. They're loving it. Patrick, you've captured the attention of all these tourists with your ridiculous blackdoodle.
Mr. Krabs	We've got all the entertainment we need, thank you very much!  Hey, where'd he go?
Mr. Krabs	Hey! What's going on?
Mr. Krabs	Okay, let er rip!  I'll be in the back counting me money. If the crowd gets bored, add some more boxes!
Mr. Krabs	OK! Get back, boy, you wouldnt want to stain your uniform.
Mr. Krabs	Stuck? Well if that don't   What's the hold up, Mr. Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Don't make me come back here.
Mr. Krabs	Sorry, absolutely no refunds.  Hold on there, what's the big idea?  Grandma, help!  All right, you leave me no choice.
Mr. Krabs	Well, I just, uh, well never mind that, boy. What's your problem?
Mr. Krabs	Oh. I see
Mr. Krabs	Thanks, boy-o. Now I'm all toasty.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, we have a situation.
Mr. Krabs	A few hours ago, the Chum Bucket was, as it should be, a desolate no-man's land.  There's only one way he could have changed things around so quickly.  Plankton must have slipped into the Krusty Krab while you weren't looking.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, how you holding up boy?
Mr. Krabs	Keep an eye peeled for anything suspiciourous
Mr. Krabs	Huh? Well he obviously didn't steal me formular, but how did he steal all my customers?
Mr. Krabs	Don't cry, love. Daddy's going to make it all right. Calm down, girl!
Mr. Krabs	Wait, wait. Here, take SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Now listen boy, I'm-a counting on you to make this a very special night for a very special girl. Remember, you're doing it for good old Mr...
Mr. Krabs	Go easy on him, lassie! I can't afford to break in a new fry cook!
Mr. Krabs	Take a seat, boy.
Mr. Krabs	Those are just the ones on the surface.  There is an entire network of tunnels and air ducts underground and I want all eyes on the look out!
Mr. Krabs	And to help watch out for Plankton, I've hired some  security.
Mr. Krabs	Fore!
Mr. Krabs	I'm putting you in charge of decorations.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! I had chores for you, but you won't do 'em anyway.
Mr. Krabs	Then shut your porthole.
Mr. Krabs	Check.
Mr. Krabs	Geez, boy.  This thing's enormous.
Mr. Krabs	Somebody...
Mr. Krabs	Uh, hmm, uh...
Mr. Krabs	Hey, what's this?  It's an old Krabby Patty wrapper.  Aah, that takes me back to the good old days.
Mr. Krabs	Hey, I think  I see the exit.
Mr. Krabs	We're  getting warm. I can feel it.
Mr. Krabs	Yes. The Krabby Patty formular. Follow me, son.  We need to go where no one will ever hear us.  Ugh. We finally made it.  Quick, get into me office before anyone sees us.
Mr. Krabs	Plankton.  You'll never have get me formula.  Not even in a flashback.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no. All that loose change out there  is driving me wallet mad with money lust.  Poor little guy's starving.  There you go, boy. You're free. Go towards the money boy. Towards the money!
Mr. Krabs	Worst play I've ever seen.  And a total rip-off!
Mr. Krabs	Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
Mr. Krabs	To concoct an elaborate escape plan?
Mr. Krabs	Ow!
Mr. Krabs	Me customers? They're coming back? SpongeBob's dopey little song is bringing 'em back.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, all right. Since I'm is such a good mood, I'll go easy on you this time.  There.  Happy landings, Plankton!
Mr. Krabs	And good riddance! Next time, you should read our sign about the mandatory side of fries policy!  Lookie, another flat-eyed, bushy-tailed customer!
Mr. Krabs	I'll think about that one while you buy a kelp soda.  Boy, you're doing it all wrong! Here, take this.  Now you can flip 2 patties at the same time; do twice the work!
Mr. Krabs	Where have you been, and what is that ridiculous thing on your head?
Mr. Krabs	Unethical? This is perfectly legit! I call all building rights under my restaurant!
Mr. Krabs	Plankton, I don't think you grasp the severity of our situation. We're trapped down here. As in, THERE IS NO WAY OUT!!!
Mr. Krabs	Say, Plankton, say we get out of here with out lives, let's agree to work together.
Mr. Krabs	Woo-hoo! You found us! I oughta pay you for this!
Mr. Krabs	You better not be trying to steal me formula!
Mr. Krabs	Satisfied with yourself, Plankton! Now you've trapped us all underground!
Mr. Krabs	You two really outdid yourselves. It almost makes me want to pay you.  Oh, yeah.  Looks like this area could use a few more decorations. Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	5,000 patties at $3.99 a pop?
Mr. Krabs	Don't be ridiculous. Why in Neptune's name would I let you...
Mr. Krabs	Thank you.
Mr. Krabs	So who's going to pay for these, then?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, you're a man of culture.
Mr. Krabs	Neptune is inconsolable, if only there where something to distract him from his pain.
Mr. Krabs	Please! I'll be ruined!
Mr. Krabs	Eat at the Krusty Krab, home of the original Krabby Patty!  And remember, we change our grease monthly!
Mr. Krabs	Me dollar lies over the ocean, me dollar lies over--  Whoa! Blarney stone, that's a horrible reek. I knew I was forgetting somethin'.  Ohhhhhhh, bring back me money to me!
Mr. Krabs	Pearl! What in the name of Neptune's Aunt Nancy is with all this ruckus?
Mr. Krabs	refrigerator.
Mr. Krabs	Empty!
Mr. Krabs	Eh? Where?
Mr. Krabs	Hehehehehe! Peanuts!  What the...  These peanut worms are pets, not vegetables!
Mr. Krabs	I'm puttin' the secret Krabby Patty formula out in plain sight.
Mr. Krabs	I told ya to stop playing with that thing and get back to work.
Mr. Krabs	The secret to the Krabby Patty formula-
Mr. Krabs	Is this thing loud enough? Oh, sure, I can hear you fine now. What was the question again?
Mr. Krabs	What's going on here?!
Mr. Krabs	Wait, you've got to pay for those! Wait, wait, wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! Boys, wait!
Mr. Krabs	That me boy, is a grease trap.
Mr. Krabs	Right behind there.  Alright. Let's get out of here!
Mr. Krabs	Save the formalities for your mother-in-law, Plankton! Yeh stole my Krabby Patty Formuler, and I want it back!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! Stop what you're doing!
Mr. Krabs	Questions are a danger to you...  and a burden to others.
Mr. Krabs	Shh! Okay, a little higher now!
Mr. Krabs	Huh?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Oh no! Did somebody call the health inspector?!
Mr. Krabs	Oh what difference does it make?
Mr. Krabs	And he's been with me for such a long time now.
Mr. Krabs	Afternoon, boy-o!
Mr. Krabs	Boy, what are you going on about?!
Mr. Krabs	Well well well, SpongeBob SquarePants. I was just about to re-tar the parking lot. Why don't you come help me, boy?
Mr. Krabs	What's that filthy animal doing in me kitchen?
Mr. Krabs	What's the problem here?
Mr. Krabs	Hey, good looking.
Mr. Krabs	Well, you're in luck! You two so thrilled with a toy. I'm have entire case e'made. I've been selling my hotcakes. That'll be $13.50 each.
Mr. Krabs	So I'll be outta town for the awards ceremony. And yer coming with me.
Mr. Krabs	No.
Mr. Krabs	No.
Mr. Krabs	And in the tradition of the event, we are required to travel cheaply, and I'm gonna teach ya the cheapest way to do it!
Mr. Krabs	Come on.
Mr. Krabs	Why, thank you!  Now watch closely, boy! You give it a little lean, and then... snatch it back!
Mr. Krabs	Quit foolin' around! I got an award to win!
Mr. Krabs	I'd like to introduce me fellow fry cook, SpongeBob. I've been giving some pointers.
Mr. Krabs	Thank you, thank you!
Mr. Krabs	No, no, no, no, no, no, exaggeratin's completely different from lyin'. You're taking the truth, and just seasoning it with little lies. I mean, just because you put salt on a Krabby Patty... it doesn't make it a salty patty. Does it?
Mr. Krabs	No! About me being cheap!
Mr. Krabs	But...but isn't that stealing?
Mr. Krabs	Heh heh heh. Looks like he bit off more than he could chew.
Mr. Krabs	A ghost, eh? Can you still cook Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs	Specials? We don't have specials!
Mr. Krabs	What?
Mr. Krabs	Bikini Bottom Labor Regulations? Eewww! Gross!  Get that thing away from me! It's giving me hives!
Mr. Krabs	It's me old navy locker. Good as new!
Mr. Krabs	Blimey! She hasn't sparkled like this since boot camp! Carry on boys.
Mr. Krabs	Why, SpongeBob, That's not your usual four-fingered salute.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, you're not talking about the Shelly Superhighway, are ya?
Mr. Krabs	What!!?? WHO APPROVED THIS PLAN!!??
Mr. Krabs	C'mon outside, and take what's coming to ya!
Mr. Krabs	What? You've been what?
Mr. Krabs	"And I like saying, ""aye."""
Mr. Krabs	"I used to dream of me restaurant with ""easy highway access!"""
Mr. Krabs	No, boyo! Not that kind!
Mr. Krabs	Plan Zed-9er9er is, I'm- I'm- I'M SELLING THE KRABBY PATTY SECRET FORMULA TO PLANKTON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mr. Krabs	What for?
Mr. Krabs	You know something, Plankton? Maybe we can talk about this later. I think I'm just gonna run for me life.
Mr. Krabs	Aye, the worst monster of them all.
Mr. Krabs	Like I was saying, The Flying Dutchman swoops down and starts stealing people's souls.
Mr. Krabs	Nothing like a good ghost story, eh, me boy? Hope you're not too scared to come to me party tonight, SpongeBob ScaredyPants!
Mr. Krabs	Well, at least we're still together, little ones.
Mr. Krabs	I think we can work something out
Mr. Krabs	She'll be workin unpaid until he returns. Won't she?
Mr. Krabs	What are you doing yelling at me customers? The duke here is one of me regulars, and I don't need to explain what happens when you start losing your regularity, do I?
Mr. Krabs	Explosive!?
Mr. Krabs	Well you ain't getting it.
Mr. Krabs	Errrrrrrr...
Mr. Krabs	Alright, alright. You're gettin' more like your old man every day. . Pearl, why don't you swing to the Chum Bucket on your way to the mall? Give Plankton a little scare?
Mr. Krabs	Hmmm... in that case, I'll need to borrow one of your dressers.
Mr. Krabs	May I remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where I keep the secret formula?
Mr. Krabs	I ain't Krabs, I'm... uh, I mean...  I'm Pearl, not Krabs.
Mr. Krabs	Whew! You really redeemed yourself boy!  Okay, you're beginning to creep me out.
Mr. Krabs	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Me customers come here for greasy food at high prices. Not for singin' and dancin'.
Mr. Krabs	Really? How about four times as much?
Mr. Krabs	I love it!
Mr. Krabs	How much am I gettin' for this?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! You get that customer a fresh patty with ketchup! Now! And don't forget to charge him again!
Mr. Krabs	It's funny, 'cause it's true!
Mr. Krabs	Certainly.
Mr. Krabs	Ok, explain it to me again, but this time, take out anything that doesnt have to do with money. Uh-huh, thats what I thought.
Mr. Krabs	Did we make any money?
Mr. Krabs	Change? As in legal tender?
Mr. Krabs	But that was before I knew that they had such an amazing talent.
Mr. Krabs	Uhh... SpongeBob. Shouldn't you be out back scrubbing the dumpster.
Mr. Krabs	Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr. Looks like I need pockets for me pockets! Ahh. Fine! With my new money finder... Who needs ya!Ahh. I was about to close up shop anyways.

Mr. Krabs	Why you little yellow... Well, I never...
Mr. Krabs	What? Oh I can't afford this.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, try telling that guy over there.
Mr. Krabs	Pearl?  Oh, my sweet little girl, all alone, with me cash register!
Mr. Krabs	Come on...  Ah ha, playing hard to get, weren't you little one?
Mr. Krabs	Why, thank you, Boy-o. I'm glad you- Wait a minute, I didn't make that Krabby Patty, and you didn't make that Krabby Patty, and those two couldn't have made it, so it must have been that rotten pipsqueak Plankton! I've gotta stop that poor excuse for a life form from- So, how do we get out of here?
Mr. Krabs	T.N.O.P?
Mr. Krabs	Oh do you?
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, backwards, what a stupid idea that-
Mr. Krabs	Ahhh, the end of another successful business day. You know Squidward this kind of day always reminds me of money  Ahhahhahah....
Mr. Krabs	Aye, good job there, SpongeBob. Say, what did you tell here that finally drove her out? I may need to know in case she ever comes back .
Mr. Krabs	So, it's true!
Mr. Krabs	We are not a soup kitchen, boy! And these will be coming out of your paycheck. Besides, we don't want to encourage-  charity...
Mr. Krabs	Curse? Boy, let me explain something about curses with a short story me grandpappy used to tell me: Oh yes, CURSES ARE NONSENSE!!
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, I'm starting to get worried. I've got a funny feeling that the Krusty Krab really is cursed.
Mr. Krabs	ME MONEYYY!!!! AAAHHHHHH!!!!
Mr. Krabs	Well, SpongeBob. I don't think were ever gonna find-
Mr. Krabs	Oh please, Madame Hagfish. Please, I'll do anything, anything at all.
Mr. Krabs	How could you tell?
Mr. Krabs	Good idea, be careful not to-
Mr. Krabs	Good job ladee!
Mr. Krabs	That's it? That's the curse?!
Mr. Krabs	Stop messing with that drain plug! Are you daft?
Mr. Krabs	One day, those two kids were wandering through the ocean, when they stumble upon it.
Mr. Krabs	Well it right, I...I don't know where it is, and I'm certainly not going to tell you.  So, so, so get out of here and stay away from that drain! No plugs will be pulled on my watch.
Mr. Krabs	You see, we had to lie to keep you from lookin' for it.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, why even bother, SpongeBob? Can't you see? The civilization as we know is crumbling to dust!  Civilic orders is in tatters. It's every man for himself, there's no other way. I'm gonna need your life essence!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob?  There, there, kid. What's the big deal?
Mr. Krabs	What do ya say we do the next one together, eh?
Mr. Krabs	It's sea salt. And don't you remember SCABS?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, ho, ho, ho, Of course, I do. That's why I'm doing this.
Mr. Krabs	Take care of yourself, little formular.
Mr. Krabs	Boy, I thought I told you--

Mr. Krabs	Well, that settles it, SpongeBob. We're just gonna have to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs	"You know, SpongeBob, might not be a good idea to bring your dirty snail into me restaurant. I think we just might want to reschedule ""Bring Your Pet To Work"" day."
Mr. Krabs	Well, he takes after you, lad.  Pay?!
Mr. Krabs	Looks good, kiddo. You want to do the honors?
Mr. Krabs	(storms to SpongeBob) All right, you landlubbers, get the lead-- (gasps) Neptune's jewels! Where are all me costumers? And just when the Krabby Patty was about to go triple platinum. Squidward. Squidward? Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Blimey, this is the first I've heard of this Mr. Sea Chicken. There goes me monopoly. But how did he lure away me loyal customers away so fast? SpongeBob, I need you to head over to the Sea Chicken Shack and see what's cookin'.
Mr. Krabs	Right.
Mr. Krabs	What about the food?
Mr. Krabs	What is it, lad? What do you see?
Mr. Krabs	Someone to create a glorious, towering statue of my likeness. You guys know anyone around here with an artistic bone in their body?
Mr. Krabs	Old Man Jenkins?
Mr. Krabs	Then who?
Mr. Krabs	Yes. Squidward, do you have any idea how many people come to the Krusty Krab every day?
Mr. Krabs	As advertised.
Mr. Krabs	I'm gonna be rich.
Mr. Krabs	Or this? (poses with a bow and arrow)
Mr. Krabs	Oh, come on, Squidward. (sniffs his armpits)
Mr. Krabs	Okay, let's see it!
Mr. Krabs	I don't have a mouth in my stomach.
Mr. Krabs	I'm gonna need you to frolic and play on this here doohickey thingy.
Mr. Krabs	Did you hear something? (cut to Mr. Krabs being painted golden and having kids climb on him) Oh, how long do I have to stay like this?

Mr. Krabs	What on earth for?! Krusty Dogs was your best idea ever boy!
Mr. Krabs	Hey SpongeBob! Have you seen Mr. Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Patrick, if you're going to distract me fry cook, the least you can do is buy some grub!
Mr. Krabs	Mauna Loa?! As in the shipwreck Mauna Loa? Legend has it that the largest unfound pirate booty lies in a truance. I have been searching for this treasure during me entire adult life. Lookin' over every nook, every cranny, every denture. Once I get me claws on it, I'll be the richest crustacean in the world!
Mr. Krabs	No. I just saw the sign.
Mr. Krabs	Heh, jokers.
Mr. Krabs	Whee-hee! What the barnacle? Well, it's just full of tickets!
Mr. Krabs	"Out of me way, boy.  I knew it. The lost treasure of the Mauna Loa is finally mine! I can practically taste them jewels.  It's a little lighter than I thought. Huh? It's empty.  No good. Ha, ha, very clever, captain. Throw in Krabs, the old ringer, eh? You must have a treasure map or something. Where you keeping it? In your pocket?  Plastic? Hang on a minute. A plastic captain... a ticket booth... tokens? It's not the Wreck of the Mauna Loa, It's ""The Wreck of the Mauna Loa"" amusement park ride!"
Mr. Krabs	Oh-ho-ho, don't flatten yourself. People want to see the real thing! It's not like a million people just show up to an old amusement park ride for fun.  Wait a minute. That's exactly what they do. Oh-ho-ho, brace yourself, fellas. Your hideaway's about to become the worst kept secret in the sea!
Mr. Krabs	Oh-ho-ho, I disagree. I'd say the little  fella is just right.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, Squidward. I was going through some records back in me office and. Huh? So, you got the hairpiece after all.
Mr. Krabs	Kara-tay? You should be making me money-ay! With your spatu-lae! Now get back to work.

Mr. Krabs	I wasn't talking to you!  Don't worry, papa's here.
Mr. Krabs	Substantial fines?!  You know, Squidward... uh... I can't really let the OWS hear about this, you know.
Mr. Krabs	Now if you need anything, just let me know.
Mr. Krabs	fluff your pillow, I'll fluff your pillow.
Mr. Krabs	It's what criminals wear when they go to bed.  I'm I think Mr. Squidward is hiding something from us, and I want you to figure out what it is.
Mr. Krabs	I'll be right back. How's the solution coming?
Mr. Krabs	How long do I need to keep this up?
Mr. Krabs	I yeah I forgot. I borrowed that from the airport. Now, let's see what really happened here.  You faker! Not to mention that you were sleeping on the job!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, goodness no. You go ahead. Take it.

Mr. Krabs	I just been turned into lunchmeat by me own worms!
Mr. Krabs	Good thinkin', squirrel! This should keep us alive for at least... a few hours... oh...
Mr. Krabs	That's weren't the attack.
Mr. Krabs	Nope, that didn't work.  [???]
Mr. Krabs	The race! The million clams!  I've been trapped in ice, mutinous thieves trying to cheat me out of me winnings.
Mr. Krabs	We're doomed. Oh hoho!
Mr. Krabs	Okay... then where's my restaurant?
Mr. Krabs	We'll see about that boy-o!
Mr. Krabs	I guess I didn't want to miss the grand unveiling of my sandwich.
Mr. Krabs	Give up now and I'll let you keep one of your antenna!
Mr. Krabs	He's going to turn us into fried snacks!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, well your coda is affecting me quota. The shrill piercing racket of your fish flute is frightening away me money.
Mr. Krabs	Get back to work, Mr. Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Great, SpongeBob! That'll be fifty bucks!
Mr. Krabs	Eh... SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	That-a-boy! Ar ar ar ar!  It's free tickets!
Mr. Krabs	Now look here, boy. I'm bringing along the secret formuler as a precaution, just in case our absence proves to temptin' to a certain one-eyed creepy-crawly.
Mr. Krabs	Ah ha ha! Whee! Ha ha ha! Ar ar ar ar!
Mr. Krabs	Wahoo!
Mr. Krabs	Ar ar ar ar!
Mr. Krabs	He he hey! Looks like we have a business venture on our hands. This vacation just got a whole lot more lookerin' if you know what I'm sayin'. Krabby Patties! Come and get your Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs	Nooooo!
Mr. Krabs	Who is ready for some fun?
Mr. Krabs	That's right. You better have a seat laddy. Gentlemen! I have an announcement to make. As of tomorrow, I'm closing the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob?  SpongeBob!?
Mr. Krabs	ME BOTTOM DOLLAR? Why I never do that!
Mr. Krabs	Did you hear something?
Mr. Krabs	But we are making such great time! Try to hold it a little longer lad!
Mr. Krabs	Ok, kids! We're just about there! Just over that hill, is the greatest sight in the sea! Now close your eyes for a big surprise!
Mr. Krabs	Well laddy! Looks like it's just you and me! And of course, the Mint!
Mr. Krabs	Guah guah guah guah guah!
Mr. Krabs	Wuh wuh wuh... o-o-one million shiny pieces of...  silver coins?
Mr. Krabs	Hello! My name is Eugene! What's yours?  Do you believe in love at first sight?
Mr. Krabs	It's a miracle!
Mr. Krabs	Good work boy!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what's wrong with you? You're paler than a baby sea horse.
Mr. Krabs	No, now go home and get some rest.  Nothing personal, lad. I just can't have you sneezing all over my food!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob?  Stop! SpongeBob! Stop!  Ooh.
Mr. Krabs	Did you say doubloon?  Let me see that! Hmm, looks somewhat authentic  Smells real enough!
Mr. Krabs	Come on, Squidward! Think about what those treasures can do for the Krusty Krab, eh? Huh? Why, I can buy you that break room you've always wanted!
Mr. Krabs	Ha-ha-ha
Mr. Krabs	Pfttttt! You ghosts don't scare me! You're nothing but thin air! Grab your sacks and follow me, boys!  Noooooooooooooooooooo!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, you thieving bilge rat! I stole this gold fair and square!
Mr. Krabs	Well, money's money!
Mr. Krabs	You know, turning patties into lettuce.
Mr. Krabs	What's going on in here? Hmm, Everything seems to be in order.The safeis still safe. Huh, I must be hearing things.Hey, how did the pickle end up on the floor?  Now, what was that rule about dropped food? Was it 5 seconds or 5 minutes or... ah, well. waste not, waste not.
Mr. Krabs	Hey! Something smells and it isn't my long johns.  Let's see here, you had the formula, why didn't you run off with it?
Mr. Krabs	Uh huh.
Mr. Krabs	Well, then, why would you mop it again?
Mr. Krabs	Oooh, that is terrible.  Makes my shell crawl just thinking about it. Bleugh!
Mr. Krabs	Anything for me beloved angel!
Mr. Krabs	Pearl, I'm home!
Mr. Krabs	Why, it's my old soap press!
Mr. Krabs	Krabby Patty .
Mr. Krabs	My jewels! SpongeBob, my entire collection of precious jewels is gone! Seen it?
Mr. Krabs	"Well, okay. I suppose I can't have her croaking at the Krusty Krab. That'd be bad for business. All right, let's see here. Hmm... Oxygen. ""02,"" I believe. Good old atomic number eight."
Mr. Krabs	So you think I'm full of hot air, do ye? Well, in this case, you're right. There's usually an air bubble or two trapped inside me shell.  Go ahead. Don't be shy.
Mr. Krabs	Don't bother yourself. As long as I keep me ole lungs moist, I can breath your fancy air all day long.
Mr. Krabs	Uh Sandy, actually I'm not interested in all of that.
Mr. Krabs	Morning, Laddy. Say, what's with the glass puppet?
Mr. Krabs	Come here you little rascal!
Mr. Krabs	Me soda machine!!!
Mr. Krabs	Patrick! I am not NOT paying you to stand around and play guess what the idiot's thinking with Squidward! Get back to work!
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward...
Mr. Krabs	At the Krusty Krab, where the tastiest sandwich in the seas is grilled to perfection by our expert fry cook.  And served with a smile by our friendly waiter.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, yeah enough dilly-dallying. Now, help me with the garbage Mr. Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Hold it!   I'll take a million for it.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, so now you're a restaurant critic.  Step up! Step up for your free glimpse at the Fiasco masterpiece!  Alright, you've had your look. Now hold up your end of the bargain!
Mr. Krabs	STOP THIEF!!!
Mr. Krabs	What happened?
Mr. Krabs	Over here boy.
Mr. Krabs	Fine.  How about that?  I'M RUINED!
Mr. Krabs	Time? But it's too soon.  I'm not ready to let them go free.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, for a second. I thought we have to give away a ton of Krabby Patties, but it looks like free ain't even enough to jump start me business. Wait, free ain't even enough, my business is doomed!
Mr. Krabs	Do you mind, I'm trying to make a money angel here.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You were supposed to be at work two hours ago!
Mr. Krabs	Well... I suppose I could join the cause. But, it'll have to be our standard deal.
Mr. Krabs	Not exactly, Miss Cheeks. A pineapple needs to be mobile, with a strong hull attached in case you need to skip town unexpectedly.
Mr. Krabs	Yes?
Mr. Krabs	Ah, the end of another lucrative work day SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	Phew, would be the first I've been saved by a pile of trash.
Mr. Krabs	Perhaps. But who could pass up a free computer?  Let's plug her in, see what she can do.
Mr. Krabs	Our computer's suppose to emote? No need to cry, little lady.
Mr. Krabs	Help me out here, buddy.
Mr. Krabs	Well in the case, welcome aboard!
Mr. Krabs	Not so fast Mr. Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	...Or old-school vacuum tubes and diodes?
Mr. Krabs	What's that?
Mr. Krabs	Your skills are rusty, you're not use your sharp self! Did you have breakfast this morning?
Mr. Krabs	You're a person who can't sleep and you can't get enough sleep! Your mind starts to go!  Here.  Come on! Now, cook!  I knew it! You lift it a patty from one side, instead of straight up! What are you trying to do, sabotage me?!  Now, you go home and get some rest!
Mr. Krabs	Come back tomorrow, after a good night's sleep!
Mr. Krabs	Ew! You're stinking like Davy Jones' locker! Are you sure you didn't forget something boy?
Mr. Krabs	Now he's crying away me mustard. THAT'S ENOUGH BOY! Me profits!  Huh? Your crying the perfect amount! Hold it boyo, You're a natural mustard dispenser!
Mr. Krabs	Ooh. I know this sound. It's the sound of me money being flushed down the toilet!  SpongeBob! Why aren't you manning the fryer?
Mr. Krabs	Let me tell you the story of Face Freeze.  It were a cold day, in November, and in Bikini Bottom lived a man who loved to make faces. And the one he liked best was to stick his tongue out.  But what he really liked, was to stick his tongue at people.
Mr. Krabs	He couldn't open his mouth for months. Until one day, his tongue dried up and fell off!
Mr. Krabs	[At Krusty Krab]Ahoy, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	: (Gasps) Where?! Where?!
Mr. Krabs	: What's going on back here? Why are we losing business?
Mr. Krabs	: Oh, I see what's going on here.  Aha! You just had to keep making faces, didn't ya? You couldn't heed me warning, could ya?
Mr. Krabs	You're sick?!
Mr. Krabs	Tongue looks fine.  Eyes, check.
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Krabs nothing.
Mr. Krabs	No. And I don't want them to get hungry either.  Now step to it, Mr. Squidward. Oh yeah, and get well soon.
Mr. Krabs	That's funny. You're the second person today whose told me that.
Mr. Krabs	We've got a situation with the kid. Something's got him spooked.
Mr. Krabs	Well, I don't care where you go, just as long as you get outta here!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! You sure everything's alright?
Mr. Krabs	25 Krabby Patties!  Order up! Order up!
Mr. Krabs	Romantic Comedy, The Movie? No!  Ah! Get that thing away from me!
Mr. Krabs	Step right up.  Guess right and win.  They'll never guess it.
Mr. Krabs	N-n-no.
Mr. Krabs	Plankton, you  don't get to guess.
Mr. Krabs	That Plankton cracks me up. Like the Bogus Business Bureau would care about my dumb contest.
Mr. Krabs	I'm won't do it.  And you can't make me.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, he's getting close.
Mr. Krabs	I can't.
Mr. Krabs	Drat your efficiency. Uh, oh, yeah.  I can't serve you your Patty until after the show.
Mr. Krabs	Once upon a time, there was a happy Patty Laddie.
Mr. Krabs	Unfortunately for Flankton,  the Patty didn't sit well with him. And he was so evil, it caused him to bloat something fierce...  ...until eventually he popped.  The end.
Mr. Krabs	There we go.  Ooh, that takes care of that.  And in three, two, one.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no, you don't.  You have to eat it on the premises.  Them's the rules.
Mr. Krabs	What is it, lad?
Mr. Krabs	Exactly! The more you give, the more  get.
Mr. Krabs	You ain't kiddin'. Here he comes now!
Mr. Krabs	Hand it over,Sheldon. Don't make it any worse.
Mr. Krabs	(shocked by what he heard, his eyes, claws, and feet exploded. He then regrows his eyes but in an angry mood) Time to get to the bottom of this.  Oohh, just act like your another fancy customer.
Mr. Krabs	I be Eugene Krab....er....I mean, uh,  Sir Krumple O'Wrapper. Uh, that's my name. Don't wear it out.
Mr. Krabs	Better than a Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs	Gotcha! Whoa! You're a big one! Can't believe I've never seen you in the Krusty Krab before!
Mr. Krabs	I want you to take a look at these folks right here. Have you ever seen any of them in the Krusty Krab? Think hard?
Mr. Krabs	I'm not talking about pie!  These holdouts are probably spending their money in some other restaurant! We need to find that 2% and reel them in. So I want you two to promote the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, don't worry about that, boy! Squidward's holdin' down the fort!  You just keep doing what you're doing and bring in that last 1%!
Mr. Krabs	That'll be 50 bucks!  This advertising campaign has really paid off!
Mr. Krabs	Which one of us is gonna get bulldozed?
Mr. Krabs	Pack your bags pipsqueak!
Mr. Krabs	You two take these petitions to save The Krusty Krab and secure as many signatures as you can!
Mr. Krabs	Hmm... Now there's something you don't see every day.
Mr. Krabs	It's time.
Mr. Krabs	I'm never leaving the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs	Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I surely break out in a rash!
Mr. Krabs	Have you finished cleaning the tables?
Mr. Krabs	Patrick, you're fired!
Mr. Krabs	Shiver me timbers!
Mr. Krabs	Can't you see we're closed?! Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!
Mr. Krabs	C'mon, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.
Mr. Krabs	I'll roll for ya boy.
Mr. Krabs	A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? On this treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad.  Avas! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.
Mr. Krabs	Ay, ay, ay. Relay that skipping. Pirates don't skip.  Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.
Mr. Krabs	Uh... no! Only the captain can lay eyes on the map.
Mr. Krabs	ARRGH! From now on, only the captain says, arrgh! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?
Mr. Krabs	"9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the ""X""? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east."
Mr. Krabs	Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. And without a loyal crew,[one of SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears, as he was getting ready to cry] what am I captain of? Just a bunch of sand!
Mr. Krabs	[] Do you think this is a problem?
Mr. Krabs	I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!
Mr. Krabs	Ha, ha. Hand it up to me lads. Heave!
Mr. Krabs	Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!
Mr. Krabs	All for one.
Mr. Krabs	They did!
Mr. Krabs	Did someone said money? I could swear that's what I heard! I got super sensitive hearing when it comes to that word!
Mr. Krabs	Up and at 'em boys! We got a tour to put on!
Mr. Krabs	Here we are boys! Our first gig! All those people are lined up to see you!
Mr. Krabs	Well that's very interesting Colonel Carper! But right now, my band and I are on a world tour! And tonight we're opening for Ned and the Needlefish!
Mr. Krabs	AHHHHHHH!!!!
Mr. Krabs	Ok Mr. Squidward. Take it from the top!  Doggonit...
Mr. Krabs	Because it's not there anymore!
Mr. Krabs	Hey! Now quit your worrying back there! With the success we're about to have, we'll be able to buy ten Krusty Krabs!
Mr. Krabs	What's this? Our pay check?
Mr. Krabs	Uh...not too much farther Squidward! Uh...oh in fact, we're just entering it now!
Mr. Krabs	Do I know you?
Mr. Krabs	Wait a minute! Where'd you think you're going with your own equipment!?
Mr. Krabs	Now I'll never get me ol' Krusty Krab out of hog!
Mr. Krabs	WAHHH!!!!!  But I don't have any money lad! Not even a nickel! It's all gone! Me Krusty Krab is gone!!!
Mr. Krabs	That's nice! I just made more money than I know what to do with!
Mr. Krabs	I don't owe you a nickel!
Mr. Krabs	Well, SpongeBob! You ready to get back to doing what we do best?
Mr. Krabs	Where is everybody?
Mr. Krabs	Please ma'am, allow me.
Mr. Krabs	But I found that dollar!
Mr. Krabs	Sure you were.  What the barnacles are you doing?
Mr. Krabs	Hey now! Let's not say things we might regret later! Tell you what,  you come back tomorrow and SpongeBob will make you a proper milkshake.  Alright! See you tomorrow!
Mr. Krabs	Where'd you learn those moves, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	I don't care if he has seaweed-for-brains. He needs to be behind that register. We've got customers out there just begging to hand me their money.
Mr. Krabs	Hop to it, lads. We haven't even taken our first order!
Mr. Krabs	Are you out of your ever-living mind?! We can't change that baby out here in front of the customers! Take him in back where the food is prepared.  Oh, that's it! Get that poopy baby out of me restaurant!
Mr. Krabs	Hold it right there!  Gotcha you prickly pest!  Woah! Woah! Woah!
Mr. Krabs	That piece of junk!?
Mr. Krabs	That little monster's still in there. You open the register, and I'll catch him in here
Mr. Krabs	Spoon?
Mr. Krabs	Hmm...I think our darling little decoy still needs something...
Mr. Krabs	Get ready! Here they come!
Mr. Krabs	Hey! What do you know! That seems to be slowing 'em down! Better crank it all the way down, just to be on the safe side!  That outta do it!
Mr. Krabs	Keep going!
Mr. Krabs	Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs	Not bad. If only I could paint him smaller.
Mr. Krabs	Don't worry SpongeBob! We're ready for 'em!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob warned me you're planning a jailbreak so I took the precaution of hiding the entire Bikini Bottom Police Force in me safe!
Mr. Krabs	Just a couple more additives, SpongeBob.  Oh and try not to breathe the fumes.
Mr. Krabs	Careful, SpongeBob! Just two drops and that stuff could...
Mr. Krabs	What's all the ruckus?
Mr. Krabs	You're gonna be missing a job if you don't get in that kitchen. The lunch rush is nigh!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, whatcha doin', boy?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, it's not... Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	Thank you, come again!  Hey, who turned out the lights?
Mr. Krabs	I won't be blackmailed! There's no way I'm giving you me secret formula!
Mr. Krabs	Here. I hope you choke on it.
Mr. Krabs	"""Instant interest""?! Well, that's practically giving money away!  SpongeBob! You're in charge while I run down to the Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank! I gotta get down there before they run out of dough!  Money, here I co... Huh?"
Mr. Krabs	Show me where the money lives! I'd bet you got a lot!  I'd like to see all of it! I'm a huge fan of money!  H-Hey! Get your hands off...   Anchovies...
Mr. Krabs	Good day, gentlemen!
Mr. Krabs	They haven't thrown me out yet...
Mr. Krabs	Oh, of course!  Here's me prized penny deposit it into a new account!
Mr. Krabs	Wait! Can it...have one moment with me penny? Alone?
Mr. Krabs	Well, time to head home!  Whoo hoo! I hope to see each and every one of ya on the outside!  Balmy! I'm locked in!  I guess I'm trapped here all night!  With all of this moolah! Such much moolah...  I have no one to tell about it! Time to russel up me some friends!
Mr. Krabs	Yes, and she's made entirely out of money.
Mr. Krabs	Ohhh! So hungry!  Oh, why did I come to this uninhabitable island? Why did I do it? Why did I say all that to Mrs. Greenback? I miss her why isn't she? Miss Greenback! Where could she be? What have I done?  Ms. Greenback! Oh, Ms. Greenback.  You're okay! I was so worried.  What's this?!! Ah! Little miss! What the Neptune?!!  A slimy money dragon! You're not sucking away me fortune without a fight!  Gimme back Mrs. Greenback you beast!
Mr. Krabs	Barnacles no, boy! I realized that they didn't pay interest on me deposit!  Hey, you cheapskates! Gimme me interest!  Well. What do you know? I doubled me money.
Mr. Krabs	Nope. You're not getting that recipe unless you're versed into talking with the unliving.
Mr. Krabs	Fine. But no eating me inventory.
Mr. Krabs	Looks like a certain foolish sponge has been conversin' with the unliving! All right you floating nuisances! Time for the bossman to mop up!  Batter up! H'ya!  Yeah, and go back in which ye came!
Mr. Krabs	"Kenny the Cat? What in clams' name is a... ""the cat""?"
Mr. Krabs	Me wallet?! What's he been doing in there?
Mr. Krabs	"What an excellent idea, SpongeBob! ""A clean cat is a moneymaking cat,"" I always say. Please yourself of the lounge facilities."
Mr. Krabs	Well, alrighty then. That's what the consuming public wants to hear.
Mr. Krabs	Tentacles, I mean it!  You get back to mindin' that register!
Mr. Krabs	Okay, have it your way, Squidward! Since you can't be bothered to take the initiative yourself, it's clear I must assign tasks to you. Hmm... Mr. Squidward, scrub the walls of the Krusty Krab 'till they gleam!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, is that so?  Perhaps you'd prefer scraping the gum off the underside of these tables!
Mr. Krabs	Oh-ho, yeah? Fine...if you refuse to work, then I can't be held responsible.
Mr. Krabs	Yes, but that won't make any difference because of your proximity to Squidward's laziness. You  be eaten!
Mr. Krabs	I'm back, fellas!
Mr. Krabs	Way to go, boy! He loves it!  And look, he's a paying customer.  Come back and see us anytime, Mr. Yeti Krab!  Hey, what are you two doing standing idol? Squidward, sweep out the crow's nest!
Mr. Krabs	Well, hurry up lads! We can't squat like this forever!
Mr. Krabs	"Yeah, I looked into that. Apparently, it's  ""illegal"". And I'll lose my ""vendor's license"". Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
Mr. Krabs	Nope, it's gotta be you, son. You're canned.  Here's your pink slip.  I'm giving you the ax.  You're fired.
Mr. Krabs	"Squidward, I'll have you know,  I was five times ""golden spatula"" in the navy,  so I'll be runnin' the grill.  Ooh!"
Mr. Krabs	Well, SpongeBob, it looks like things are back to normal. And to make up for that extra nickel I was losing, I installed a pay toilet.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, for kelp sake. You're a lost cause.
Mr. Krabs	Yes it is. And consequently, you are just neat as a pin! Now get to work!
Mr. Krabs	And how is everything for you today, sir?
Mr. Krabs	You must've paid five times the price of a regular patty for that!
Mr. Krabs	Well, we can't have that. He's me best employee. Well, no offence.
Mr. Krabs	There, there. Failing your driver's test is nothing to cry over.
Mr. Krabs	Sure, I taught me own daughter Pearl how to drive like a little angel.
Mr. Krabs	Wipe that boating school malarkey out of your mind, son! It's all a racket.
Mr. Krabs	No, but you got the right fire in your belly.
Mr. Krabs	Can't disagree with you there. All right, put 'er in gear!  Hmm.
Mr. Krabs	Now, here's a place you should be comfortable with.
Mr. Krabs	Better.
Mr. Krabs	Well, we, you know, we could do that. But you can't learn to drive without a boat. Or can ye?
Mr. Krabs	Great job, boy.
Mr. Krabs	You think when I was your age, I tip-toed around like a tadpole on a petunia?
Mr. Krabs	Nonsense, boy-o. All it takes is some confidence and a little coordination. Why, your little pet snail could do it.
Mr. Krabs	Not really.
Mr. Krabs	Well, I mean, really, he has more on top of the wheel.
Mr. Krabs	Oh. Well, um...you two seem very happy together.
Mr. Krabs	: Alright, hold on a second there free-loader! What are you doing here?
Mr. Krabs	:  What are you doing throwing away a perfectly sellable sandwich?!
Mr. Krabs	What in the name of Neptune's tail fin is going on in here, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Whatever. Now if these little fellers could work... maybe you'll be on to something... hey, you couldn't make me a little tiny army of unpaid workers, could ya?
Mr. Krabs	Well now, that shouldn't interfere with Pete's work.
Mr. Krabs	Company picnic?
Mr. Krabs	Yes, yes it is.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, you're confused? Let me show you a little hack.  See? You open it with your teeth.  There, isn't that fun? And afterwards, you can toss it around like a, you know, one of those things you toss around.
Mr. Krabs	I can't hear what you're sayin'! So... here it comes!
Mr. Krabs	"Well, we sure had our fun and games today. But just maybe we've learned a little something too. About each other and ourselves. I guess you'd have to say, ""This was the greatest..."""
Mr. Krabs	Well, looks like we've got company.
Mr. Krabs	Plankton!
Mr. Krabs	You don't even have any employees!
Mr. Krabs	Is this backwards?  Oh, that's not it either.
Mr. Krabs	Well, I don't know.
Mr. Krabs	You wanna join in all that fun over there with Mr. Squidward, don't ya?
Mr. Krabs	Ok, then. I'm outta here! See ya! Yahoo!
Mr. Krabs	Ooh!  Me first! Me first!
Mr. Krabs	Whew! That was a cl...
Mr. Krabs	Nope. Nothing.  I can't smell a cent or a dollar. Or any money in a 5-mile radius. We might as well settle down early.  Just as soon as that guy finishes his meal.
Mr. Krabs	That gives me a fine idea, SpongeBob. Since it looks we're gonna be stuck here for a while, why don't you pull up a barrel, me laddies? While I retell you a thrillin' tale of me mysterious salty past.  There, now. The lights are properly dimmed.  Feast yourself on these slightly expired soda crackies  as I explain ya the yarn that puts hair on your chest.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, that sir? Why sir, that's a sea-cucumber sandwich, sir, with the crusts cut off, sir. A little booshie-amusie for the boys, sir.
Mr. Krabs	I don't see what's so amusing about that, Mr. Squidward. We were a cargo ship  heading straight into pirate territory with a fresh supply of suntan lotion for shipwreck sailors whose skin was chafed.  Chafed, Mr. Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Aye-aye, sir!
Mr. Krabs	"Oh, don't ""huzzah"" yet, boys."
Mr. Krabs	Oh, nothing sir! Uh, they just really enjoy eating slop! Don't you, boys?
Mr. Krabs	Well, you see, sir, I was just gonna take this here match and...  And so, I found meself in the brig with two guards watching me every move.  The one was as brutal and ugly a bounder as you ever wish to see in your darkest nightmare!
Mr. Krabs	Wise lad.  And so, after a few hours of bouncing off the walls, the sugar finally wore off.  And soon, he was napping like a baby. This was me chance to use me sweet key to freedom.  But did I dare take it? I'd be in violation of the naval code. Then something happened that made me mind up for me.  Pirates! We were under attack!  I had to act fast!  Wake up, lad! Wake up! Man your battle stations!  I was on me own.  I could see it all. A pirate ship! And on that island: a crew of five naval men! Our only hope, marooned on a beach by those same scurvy pirates!  And suffered from the effects of chafe! Sunburn!  The pirates had already launched a boat and were preparing to board our vessel!
Mr. Krabs	What are you using for ammo there, Ensign?
Mr. Krabs	Hoo! Whoo! Ha-ha! Whoop! Missed me!  Uh-oh! Uh, anyone for cherries jubilee?
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, why aren't you taking orders from these good people?
Mr. Krabs	Of course you can. Any idiot can do it. Now, get to work! I'm gonna go find SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	You try?! Listen up, me boy-oh! You'll do more than try! You'll...
Mr. Krabs	Right.
Mr. Krabs	I wonder how many Krabby Patties I can sell.
Mr. Krabs	I'm ruined! No-one wants to see a one Krabby Patty Eating Contest, least of all me wallet.
Mr. Krabs	No, no of course you are! How would you like to eat as many Krabby Patties as you can handle and restore the honor of your home town.
Mr. Krabs	Listen up, Mister. No more fooling around, you're here to eat and eat and then eat some more.
Mr. Krabs	What are you doin'? Your wastin' time!
Mr. Krabs	Nah, that can't be it, McNulty has teeth. SpongeBob! Let's go to the film.
Mr. Krabs	Your both wrong! Or possibly right, I mean I don't know much about his personal life, the point is, he's not tasting boys,  That's where Oswald McNulty has  the edge! Those extra seconds you take to taste a patty Patrick, are slowing you down! From now on  You must put them in yer mouth, then swallow!
Mr. Krabs	Come one, come all! This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday! It's a Founders Day extravaganza! Watch our home town hero, Patrick Star, take on the down the beloved champion from three towns over, Oswald McNulty! And see who takes, The Patty Belt!
Mr. Krabs	I smell mutiny, what's going on here?
Mr. Krabs	Well I didn't know either until you decided you weren't doing the contest, and that means all your training patties, just became plain, eating patties. Now if you was to do the contest, I might be inclined to tear up this here little bill, and of course, there are all the people counting on you son.
Mr. Krabs	Listen up crew, I have an announcement! Bikini Bottom's new sports stadium will officially be named after this restaurant!
Mr. Krabs	While I'm gone, Squidward mans the helm.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, hi.
Mr. Krabs	Heh-heh. Sure do. The Bikini Bottom Mets.
Mr. Krabs	What a bunch of malarkey.
Mr. Krabs	Well, look, SpongeBob's got longpants on and you've got.. none!
Mr. Krabs	What's wrong, slick? Your not having trouble with your pants, are ye?
Mr. Krabs	What's goin' on? How pathetic, a man, in longpants, crying.
Mr. Krabs	Well, good! Now, I want you back on the grill tomorrow morning. And if it makes you feel anymore manly, you can do your grilling outdoors!
Mr. Krabs	So what you're saying is if I never leave, it will be free forever!
Mr. Krabs	Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free! Free!
Mr. Krabs	Oh boy! Free soup!  Little heavy on the salt.
Mr. Krabs	Why do you keep doing this, Plankton?
Mr. Krabs	If I could, I would.
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, careful now, careful.  Your ink will run.
Mr. Krabs	The name's Krabs... Eugene Krabs.  And yours?
Mr. Krabs	Ooh. I do have a very  recipe...
Mr. Krabs	Oh, Cashina...
Mr. Krabs	Ya know, we're gonna have to have another talk about fantasy and reality.
Mr. Krabs	Let me talk to her.
Mr. Krabs	Cashina, you know I love ya.  And now me daughter loves ya too. Will you marry me, Cashina?
Mr. Krabs	Cashina, you gave it to my life, but I thought I'd leave the rest of it alone. You showed me once and for all: If money can't buy you love, it can give you love.
Mr. Krabs	The what?
Mr. Krabs	Plankton?!
Mr. Krabs	Plankton, are you saying it was all just a scheme to you? And you felt nothing?
Mr. Krabs	"Now instead of wasting my precious money on your ""clothes"" and your ""school supplies""..."
Mr. Krabs	I'll miss you around the house.
Mr. Krabs	Well, thank you. That's nice of you to say.
Mr. Krabs	Flip them patties, boy-o, just like the old days.
Mr. Krabs	There he is. Come on in here.
Mr. Krabs	Wait a minute! I can't afford two SpongeBobs! If this a scheme to collect two paychecks, forget about it! You're getting one paycheck split in two.
Mr. Krabs	You want me tell you the formula? That's quite a responsibility, laddy.
Mr. Krabs	So you've all memorized the formula. Now get to work! I have to calculate paychecks.
Mr. Krabs	With my garbage? On my land?! I'll be chargin' ye a reasonable rental fee.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, hold on Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month.
Mr. Krabs	Me cash register, me money.
Mr. Krabs	Huh? More cookies, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	J-just how true are these cookie fortunes SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs	You're right me boy-o,  I've got to face me fortune.
Mr. Krabs	Nothing Sheldon. Here, have a fortune cookie.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, that's a million dollar idea that I just had that you just said before me.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, well, okay, Don. Will this make me rich?
Mr. Krabs	Let's just leave it to the professionals, boy-o.
Mr. Krabs	Ooh, I do declare, Mr. Grouper, I believe I have a case of the vapors.
Mr. Krabs	"How much ""a lot more""?"
Mr. Krabs	Ho-ho, that sounds great!
Mr. Krabs	Huh?
Mr. Krabs	Whatcha doing, boy?
Mr. Krabs	No, I mean forever and ever. You're fired.
Mr. Krabs	That's right, me boy. It's all history now, but you, you have the most important job of all.  You give tours and sell tchotchkes in the gift shop.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, it's so convenient, see?
Mr. Krabs	Do you have a ticket, sir? Can't be in a museum without a ticket.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no!
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward, what is going on in here?
Mr. Krabs	But how did you get these customers to eat Krabby Patties? They know they're filled with sand.
Mr. Krabs	Here!
Mr. Krabs	Great, now get back to work!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, that's the way you want it.
Mr. Krabs	Yes. Yes it is. It's bringing me closer to my favorite part of the community. Their money!
Mr. Krabs	Pencils, paper! Pencils, paper!
Mr. Krabs	What? Wait a second. None of you bulletin board browsers are buying me patties!
Mr. Krabs	And does anyone need to buy a pen?
Mr. Krabs	He's a diabolical genius! That's what he is!
Mr. Krabs	We'll teach him a lesson he'll never forget!
Mr. Krabs	Shh. Maintain radio silence. Wait a minute. I see something.
Mr. Krabs	Rev your excitement engines, Mr. Squidward!  Do you not know what tomorrow is?
Mr. Krabs	You darn tootin' it is! And you two will be me right claw men! Eh, could use some extra muscle to set up the booth.  Perfect! Let's hit the road!
Mr. Krabs	And I brought plenty of free samples to sell!
Mr. Krabs	Everybody pipe down!!! I don't wanna hear another peep from anyone until we get to Food Con!
Mr. Krabs	We gotta get movin'! The judgin' starts tomorrow! Now, since you boys caused the accident, you'll be haulin' the trailer.
Mr. Krabs	"He says ""Food Con"". But all I hear is ""food""."
Mr. Krabs	Hey there, boy-oh! I've taken the liberty of creatin' a safe to secure our precious patty.
Mr. Krabs	Enough of this! I am your boss and I order you to give me that patty!
Mr. Krabs	Enough of this!
Mr. Krabs	Shh! Shh! I hear him over there! He's arguing with the patty! Get him!
Mr. Krabs	Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry!
Mr. Krabs	I don't know. Me eyes were burnin'! All I saw was a little eyeball and a pair of antenna and...  Plankton!  He's still in there! Alone! With me secret formula! He could be doing anything with it!  He could be reading it!
Mr. Krabs	Here's another routine! You're the meat in me knuckle sandwich!
Mr. Krabs	Looks like I'm gonna have to beef up security around here.
Mr. Krabs	Pisha! He'll think it's still here! His tiny brain is incapable of the kind of abstract thinking that is required for reflection. Or thoughtful reasoning and deduction. He cannot ruminate.
Mr. Krabs	School is dumb? You've misspelled every word.
Mr. Krabs	Oh! P...P...Plankton? What are you doin' here?
Mr. Krabs	Thanks to this here diploma, I'm suddenly smart enough to never give you me secret formula!
Mr. Krabs	Ah, rip current, schmip current! Ain't nothin'.
Mr. Krabs	No takie-backsies! Three Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, tyrant am I? Alright, I'm a tyrant! The worst in all the seven seas! One of 'em!
Mr. Krabs	What's the meanin' of this?
Mr. Krabs	You're not helpin', boy.
Mr. Krabs	Haven't you forgotten something? I am not captain anymore! Squidward is!
Mr. Krabs	Beg me.
Mr. Krabs	I said I don't care.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no you don't! Come here!
Mr. Krabs	I can't hear you!
Mr. Krabs	Wait a minute! Gimme that!
Mr. Krabs	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off!  All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. Shake hands.
Mr. Krabs	Mrs. Puff, we've been dating for 16 years now. So, I was sincerely hoping that today might finally be the day that...
Mr. Krabs	What a woman!
Mr. Krabs	I'm gonna share a secret with you that I never told anyone.
Mr. Krabs	I sold it meself. It's Captain Tightwad from Issue 53! They say he's a bad guy, but, you know, I think he's just misunderstood.
Mr. Krabs	Tremble before Captain Tightwad!
Mr. Krabs	Wha... What do ya mean?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, come on! What do... What do I have to do here?
Mr. Krabs	Oh, okay.
Mr. Krabs	Ah, barnacles! I've forgot me debit card.
Mr. Krabs	Maybe I'll just stick to reading comics from now on.
Mr. Krabs	I heard that, Mr. Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	"Right you are, Sandy. SpongeBob has lost touch with reality. I've seen it before. They call it: the ""mocking mimicry madness."""
Mr. Krabs	Hey!
Mr. Krabs	That was a pretty good impression, though.
Mr. Krabs	"Oh, they're ""lawyering"" up, boy-o. They're makin' a legal claim to keep living in your body."
Mr. Krabs	And don't come back until you're dewormed!
Mr. Krabs	Perfect, now get out there and feed the rest of those kids.
Mr. Krabs	Okay, birthday boy. Take a swing at that piata, son.
Mr. Krabs	Come on, men, let's cheese it!
Mr. Krabs	Yes.
Mr. Krabs	You.
Mr. Krabs	Unless you wanna go back to the kids' party.
Mr. Krabs	Good, now I'll just get the lay of the land around here.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, yeah.  Your birthday cake is right through here.
Mr. Krabs	What the  SpongeBob, you can't just go around taking people's precious jewels!
Mr. Krabs	All right, what did he say? 18 rights, then four lefts, or five? Ooh.
Mr. Krabs	Ooh.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, I'll be right down to have a look. Just need to find something here. All right, where was I? Four somersaults and a barrel roll, I think.
Mr. Krabs	Dogfish!
Mr. Krabs	Why, you little
Mr. Krabs	Look out, flood's a-coming!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no.
Mr. Krabs	Everyone seems to really like the Krabby Patty!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!  Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs	Of course not! But I'll be cooking the Krabby Patties from now on! Krabby Patties  named after me! Mr. Krabby.  Ouch!
Mr. Krabs	Like they used to be? It's the same formula!
Mr. Krabs	I'm ready! I'm ready!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no, you don't!
Mr. Krabs	Ow! Eee! Hey!
Mr. Krabs	Make a hole!
Mr. Krabs	Ah, what do you need me for? You got everything: a magic touch for cooking, lots of customers, money!
Mr. Krabs	Well, I do own 99% of SpongeBob's Place so I guess that's a yes. But you'll have to stand in line if you want to place an order!
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, the ghost is gone.
Mr. Krabs	Well, climb up there! Get a closer look.
Mr. Krabs	What goes on, boyos?
Mr. Krabs	Course not!  Life insurance is money the beneficiary gets when a person dies. By the way, who gets the money?
Mr. Krabs	Whoa. Maybe I shouldn't have borrowed Pearl's shorts.
Mr. Krabs	The hooks. So there I was minding my own business...
Mr. Krabs	Aye.  The hooks. They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey they grab you by the britches...  ...and haul you way up high. Then higher, and higher, and higher   until you're hauled up to the surface flopping and gasping for breath. And then they cook ya, and then they eat ya, or worse...
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?
Mr. Krabs	They should be right here.
Mr. Krabs	Boys. I wasn't quick enough. They're gone! [] If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd...  ...I'd throttle 'em! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!
Mr. Krabs	I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.
Mr. Krabs	Whoa. Whew. Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, laddie?
Mr. Krabs	Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.
Mr. Krabs	I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob.  But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs	I'm off to make a delivery.
Mr. Krabs	Yee-haw!
Mr. Krabs	Gotcha.
Mr. Krabs	That'll be the day! I don't trust Plankton as far as I throw him! That's why we're gonna shadow that little twit and find out what he's up to!
Mr. Krabs	Quick, boy, he's getting away!
Mr. Krabs	"His plan!  Did you hear that, SpongeBob? He said, ""plan!"""
Mr. Krabs	Now that I sees it, I believes it.
Mr. Krabs	We never left, Sheldon. The Mr. Krabs and SpongeBoob who followed the robot you to Dullsville were also robots. Gotcha!
Mr. Krabs	Huh?  I don't know how you're doing this, boy-o, but keep it up! Folks will pay every cent they have to watch Krabby Patties dance! Look at how cute they are!
Mr. Krabs	Right you are, boy-o!  Here, take this! Here you go! I can't stop!  There you go! What's happening to me?!
Mr. Krabs	When I bite into a Dork Krabby Mint Patty, I get the sensation of swimming in money! Piles and piles of it!
Mr. Krabs	Wait! Wait, don't go! That's me money walking out the door! What's the meaning of this, Mr. Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	Yes, yes, yes?
Mr. Krabs	I don't wear shoes.
Mr. Krabs	I can think of ten good reasons to never let go of a dime, boy. There's got to be another way! Grab me captain's quarters and heave!  Me arms!
Mr. Krabs	Time to count me money. My money! Squidward!
Mr. Krabs	Well, I'll be a sea monkeys uncle.
Mr. Krabs	I can't swim!
Mr. Krabs	Hey, I think I'm swimming!
Mr. Krabs	Attention! Attention! All Krusty Krew employees, attention!  Get the anchors out of your pants and report to me office!  That will be all.  I have an important announcement to make.
Mr. Krabs	Thar she blows!
Mr. Krabs	I can smell the money already! I'll be in me office if you need me!
Mr. Krabs	Don't you just love me new office? Pearly designed it for me.
Mr. Krabs	What?! Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab! I mean, the Kuddly Krab.  What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers?  How could we ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?!  It's hip! It's coral! It's... it's losing money!  Oh you're right SpongeBob. But I can't fire me pride and joy, it'll break her fragile little heart! What am I going to do?
Mr. Krabs	Great then, it's all settled: you fire Pearly, I'll wait in me office.
Mr. Krabs	I can't let him do this!  Get on with it, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	That's me old girl; tough as nails, just like her old man!  But how am I going to get my money back for all this stuff?
Mr. Krabs	AAAAAARRRGH!
Mr. Krabs	Doing great boys. Just six more years to pay off your debt.
Mr. Krabs	One of everything?! Whoopee!  I love Bubble Buddy! Squidward, show our best customer to his table.
Mr. Krabs	So long, boys! You see Squidward, the restaurant game is all about service. The customer is always right. Remember that, lad, and you'll be as successful as me one day.
Mr. Krabs	I say we tip something over!
Mr. Krabs	Uhh, how much are these tin cans gonna cost me?
Mr. Krabs	You eat me krusty products, every one you see. From the Krabby Patt-A to the Krabby Patt-Z. Well this here little ditty's a walk down memory lane. To stimulate the money spending center of your brain.
Mr. Krabs	With frozen Krabby Patties, in your freezer aisle, You can make your own right at home pantsless all the while. Buy some, buy some frozen Krabby Patties! Buy some, buy some frozen Krabby Patties!  Buy some frozen Krabby Patties! With your money! 'Cause I want it! Right now!
Mr. Krabs	That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan. Now pay attention, the lad's got a surprise for you.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, no, no, no, no, lad. You know the rules; you have to make the gift.
Mr. Krabs	25 dollars? A bomb?
Mr. Krabs	Won't do any good. I've seen this before. When that pie goes up to bat, I mean, hits his lower intestine... boom!
Mr. Krabs	Note to self: Watch out for Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Plankton!
Mr. Krabs	Uh, SpongeBob?  Could you let me down?
Mr. Krabs	No, the other most important rule. Regarding the secret formula.
Mr. Krabs	Today, I want you to take inventory on everything in here; every last pickle and patty must be accounted for.
Mr. Krabs	Don't get all loopy on me, boy. I need your help. And where in the high seas is Squidward?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, I'm not paying you to stand around.  Get back to the kitchen!
Mr. Krabs	Stop! Please!  Wait!
Mr. Krabs	Well, if I was a robot, which I'm not, at least I'm well put together. Not some rusted-out, steam-driven piece of junk!
Mr. Krabs	But...
Mr. Krabs	Help! Get Away! No!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! You're wasting my precious carbon dioxide!
Mr. Krabs	Eh, forget winter, boy, we're talking about sun tanning, hanging 10, and swimming all year long!
Mr. Krabs	You mean pay off! Hurry, SpongeBob, fill the pool, fill the pool!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, take these moldy sponges to the garbage, will ya?
Mr. Krabs	What's the meaning of this, SpongeBob?!
Mr. Krabs	Aw, it looks harmless.
Mr. Krabs	Oh. It started out as a simple order: a Krabby Patty with cheese. When the customer took a bite, no cheese!
Mr. Krabs	Welcome. Welcome, everyone, to the grand opening of The Krusty Krab 2!
Mr. Krabs	The obvious choice for the job.
Mr. Krabs	Uh, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, you're a great fry cook, but I gave the job to Squidward because being manager is a big responsibility. Well, let's face it, he's more... mature than you.
Mr. Krabs	Closer, but no, no, no.
Mr. Krabs	Poor kid.
Mr. Krabs	With cheese, Mr. Squidward, with cheese.
Mr. Krabs	But... But this is crazy! I didn't do it!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, me boy, you've come just in time. Please, tell King Neptune all about me.
Mr. Krabs	Huh?
Mr. Krabs	Tartar...  ...sauce?
Mr. Krabs	Extra ketchup, extra mustard, HOLD THE MAYO!!
Mr. Krabs	Quick, boy! Bar the door!
Mr. Krabs	You could give it to me.  Just a suggestion.
Mr. Krabs	Plankton's broke! Ooh-ooh! Plankton's broke! Ha-ha!
Mr. Krabs	Me formuler!
Mr. Krabs	Why should I believe you, ya lyin' liar?!
Mr. Krabs	Jimmy.
Mr. Krabs	Refunds?!  Listen up boy!  Get in there and make me customers some Krabby Patties! All right, Plankton...  SpongeBob! What's wrong, boy?
Mr. Krabs	STOP!!  I'm not your enemy!  Plankton is your enemy!
Mr. Krabs	So, join me. Help get the formuler back, and I'll give each and every one of ya a free Krabby Patty!  Oh, no, wait! Even better: a slight discount.  To the Chum Bucket!
Mr. Krabs	Wrong answer!
Mr. Krabs	Wait,  didn't look painful.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah, I guess that's a short way of saying it. STOP THAT BUBBLE!
Mr. Krabs	No! This be but a harbinger of what I fear lies ahead. For you, for me, for all of Bikini Bottom! The Krabby Patty is what ties us all together! Without it, there will be a complete breakdown of social order! A war of all against all! Dark times are ahead! Dark times indeed!
Mr. Krabs	This way!
Mr. Krabs	"It's okay, everyone. The post-apocalypse is almost over!  Ain't that right SpongeBob?  ""Eugene, Eat my sub-aquatic air bubbles. Love, Plankton?"""
Mr. Krabs	Don't cry, me boy. Everything's gonna be fine. For us.
Mr. Krabs	Go find that Krabby Patty!
Mr. Krabs	Well, I never thought I'd be eaten by a dolphin.
Mr. Krabs	We need to get these guys back in the water!
Mr. Krabs	$8.99 for a Krabby Patty?! Why didn't I think of that?  You.  Cease and desist that unauthorized patty flippin'!
Mr. Krabs	Me formuler!
Mr. Krabs	Whatever you're gonna do, make it quick! They're closing in on us!
Mr. Krabs	Hold on, me bucko! Food's on the way!  Uhh... You got money, right?
Mr. Krabs	Huh?
Mr. Krabs	Wait! I've got an idea!  ...And so ladies and gentlemen, be sure to buy plenty of Krabby Patties as I bury myself alive!  No free refills.
Mr. Krabs	Great Neptune in Heaven, I need an idea!
Mr. Krabs	Mr. Squidward! Come look!
Mr. Krabs	What's next? Sequin milkshakes?
Mr. Krabs	I don't believe it!
Mr. Krabs	I never had 46,853 customers.
Mr. Krabs	Uhh... Yes. Yes, I do, lad. Well, the Krusty Krab's only a short walk away. Why don't you head on down. For old time's sake.
Mr. Krabs	Here's the key to the Krusty Krab. She's yours now.
Mr. Krabs	"Ladies and gentlemen! ""Pretty Patties"" is now under new management! Who's next?"
Mr. Krabs	What's wrong with you?
Mr. Krabs	The customer is always right.
Mr. Krabs	...Get off me wave!
Mr. Krabs	Well, there ain't no use crying over it.
Mr. Krabs	How do you know?
Mr. Krabs	What a no-good eel-in-a-kelp that guy was!  There ain't nothing worse than a thief!  Thieves need to be locked up forever! They should all be strung up by their gills and forced to breathe air!
Mr. Krabs	Well, no.
Mr. Krabs	Um... Well..
Mr. Krabs	Well, he...
Mr. Krabs	All right then!  Hugs?  You put in  a hard day's work, boys!
Mr. Krabs	Pipe down, Squidward. I'm trying to concentrate. This thing is as good as a blank check direct from the First National Bank of Santa Claus.
Mr. Krabs	With saddle bags full of money!
Mr. Krabs	Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants.
Mr. Krabs	Stick with the squirrel jokes, boy. Now get busy.
Mr. Krabs	Can you do this?  Everyone in my family can do that.
Mr. Krabs	"I knew it! There was no way some ""airhead"" was gonna win anything against a water breather!"
Mr. Krabs	All ashore, that's going to shore, Mr. Squidward! Land ho!
Mr. Krabs	Hip hip!
Mr. Krabs	Uh, top of the mornin'!...?
Mr. Krabs	I'm going over to the Chum Bucket to play with Plankton.
Mr. Krabs	I didn't lose any money.  I lost...
Mr. Krabs	I bet your contract and I lost.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	And fries should be fries, either way.
Mr. Krabs	Well, old girl, this looks like our final chapter.  Huh?
Mr. Krabs	Now, be gone with you, you puny pest!
Mr. Krabs	Avast, ye patty pirate! This is no ghost. This is...  Plankton! Stealing me booty!
Mr. Krabs	Good night, me boy!
Mr. Krabs	What did you say, punk?!
Mr. Krabs	Money?!  You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?
Mr. Krabs	La da dee. Stitch one per two. Doo da dee doo. Di dee dee da de...  What's that smell?  The register!  $49.0... 8?! That's a penny short!
Mr. Krabs	Not the sandwich, boy! The curvy cutie holding the sandwich!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, what I wouldn't give to have a lass like that on me claw.
Mr. Krabs	Gla-gloo!

Mr. Krabs	Oh, I doubt that, my little shrimp boat.
Mr. Krabs	You'll never have to walk again, my little lobster bib!
Mr. Krabs	I don't know, boy! I've got another date tomorrow! I'm caught in the middle of me two great loves! Sweet Mrs. Puff, and the rest of me money!
Mr. Krabs	Now remember, we keep it cheap by going to the park. And no matter how much I ask you, you don't give me any of me money. Now, give me a dollar.
Mr. Krabs	Flowers! Flowers, boy! Go get flowers!
Mr. Krabs	Mrs. Puff, you're as beautiful as ever.
Mr. Krabs	What's that?
Mr. Krabs	And here's a box of chocolates!  SpongeBob, where's the chocolates?
Mr. Krabs	Here's those chocolates I bought for you. What are we doing today, Mrs. Puff? Dinner? Dancing? A trip to the moon?
Mr. Krabs	There's no time for suggestions! Go buy a hat!
Mr. Krabs	Good job, lad.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff needs a new fur coat!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob! I'm glad I caught you. I want you to buy Mrs. Puff...
Mr. Krabs	Cheer up? How can I cheer up... when you're spending all me hard-earned cash?!
Mr. Krabs	Aawww...
Mr. Krabs	Huh? Ah! The Krusty Krab, she's empty!  All hands on deck! Batten the front doors! Brace the cash register! Break out the happy snacks! Squidward, where have all me money paying customers gone?
Mr. Krabs	There ain't nothing fancy about that word!
Mr. Krabs	Not if you're a sailor!
Mr. Krabs	Yes, yes, yes?
Mr. Krabs	Uh... Right, now what was that part about the, um... Who now?
Mr. Krabs	All right, you two foul mouths. As punishment for FOULING the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom.  Ow, Ooh! Ow! My  foot! What   genius puts a  rock in a  path?! Can't you see I got a  foot here?! Oh!
Mr. Krabs	No, please, not me mommy!  Wait, please don't tell me mother! I don't think her little old heart can take it!
Mr. Krabs	You've got 5 minutes!
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, I got a proposition for ye. How's about you go catch me some of those little moneyfish?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, we have a whole ecosystem full of hungry paying customers.  Oh no! Don't tell me! You've stopped caring for the customer!
Mr. Krabs	I'm gonna need more than that, boy.
Mr. Krabs	What don't you understand about... more!
Mr. Krabs	Uh... uh... This... This isn't what it looks like, SpongeBob! Why... uh... We're just... uh... having a little tea party!
Mr. Krabs	Whew!
Mr. Krabs	I'm taking jelly off the menu.
Mr. Krabs	Always ready, Plankton. Always ready.
Mr. Krabs	Friend? Not in here he ain't.
Mr. Krabs	Get angry!
Mr. Krabs	Win this one for the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs	Counting me money, money sweeter than honey, money, money, this, money, money, that, profits will make me wallet fat!
Mr. Krabs	"What's with all this ""change"" nonsense?"
Mr. Krabs	Oh, that reminds me. I got something for you.
Mr. Krabs	There's going to be a few changes around here. Every time I catch you two goofing off, I'm gonna charge you for it.
Mr. Krabs	And you're going to make protest speeches?
Mr. Krabs	Oh! Uh, evening, Mr. Squidward. Uh... I was just in the neighborhood and I, uh... thought I'd drop by to... beg you to come back to work! The Krusty Krab is a wreck! I'm ruined without you and the little yellow guy.  The teenagers I hired is ruining the place! And the worst part is, they won't leave me alone!
Mr. Krabs	I got a bad feeling in the pit of me wallet.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward! SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	There ain't no one fool enough to take on an Alaskan Bull Worm!
Mr. Krabs	Go get 'em, Sandy! We have the utmost confidence in you!  Now, what was that idea of yours?
Mr. Krabs	Clothe me if you can, silly landlubbers!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, but I will. Even if I have to come back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...  And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...
Mr. Krabs	You're a mystery, SpongeBob.  Get rid of it.
Mr. Krabs	Now, if we could only get rid of Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Squidward, what's going on in here?
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob, your story has touched me heart. Believe it or not, I know what it's like to give up a best friend.
Mr. Krabs	The point is, sometimes you have to set things free even though it's hard.  Look at her. She misses the great outdoors, the wide-open spaces, the rolling green pastures. The kitchen is no place for a live horse.
Mr. Krabs	Ah...That smells like...  ...the health inspector!  Wash your hands, clean the floors, change your underwear! The health inspector's here!  If he finds one health violation, he'll close us down for good. We've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs	Then we'll give him a smorgasbord!  The future of the Krusty Krab is at stake!
Mr. Krabs	Some Fried Flotsam?
Mr. Krabs	You loony loofah, he is the impostor! We've been duped!
Mr. Krabs	I bet his mom bought him that hat.  If that impostor wants a Krabby Patty, then by Neptune, we'll give him one.  You're dancin' with the crab man now! Join me, boy, or you're fired!
Mr. Krabs	Listen, he ate it!  Oh, look at him choke!  Look at him suffer!  Did you see that, boy? Oh man, the look on his face.
Mr. Krabs	"What's this ""we"" stuff? You fed him the tainted patty. Looks like it's the stony lonesome for you!"
Mr. Krabs	This should be far enough. Now get diggin'!
Mr. Krabs	Somethin' ain't quite right.
Mr. Krabs	Uhh, he was a credit to health inspectors everywhere, and, uhh...
Mr. Krabs	Laugh, boy.
Mr. Krabs	All set!
Mr. Krabs	...ttles of soda! Bottles of soda, Same thing, put 'em in the freezer.
Mr. Krabs	Funny? Oh, yeah!  He's a real cutup, that one. He knows how to keep the growing stages! Good one, boy! Always on, that one, there's no off on his funny switch!  Oh, look, I almost forgot, it's 'Open Cash Register' night! First two customers get all the money in the cash register!
Mr. Krabs	There is no ice! There's never been any ice. Ice is just a myth.
Mr. Krabs	Put him down now! He's a mad dog!
Mr. Krabs	It's empty?
Mr. Krabs	Disposable? Phooey.
Mr. Krabs	It was the queen of Switzerland.
Mr. Krabs	I'm having an antique sale. Have a look around.
Mr. Krabs	Deal.
Mr. Krabs	A perfect fit, eh son?
Mr. Krabs	Well-- I don't know... but, okay! But only because you look so dashing in that hat.
Mr. Krabs	Fresh out.
Mr. Krabs	SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs	Aw, forget it! And you're not beautiful, either.
Mr. Krabs	Not even a little tired of that old piece of junk?
Mr. Krabs	Novelty hats.  How about this air-condition one?
Mr. Krabs	I thought the Foxy Grandpa would get him for sure. I didn't want to have to do this but he leaves me no other option. I'm gonna have to scare it off of him.  This'll scare him.
Mr. Krabs	I am the ghost of soda drink hats.  I'm here to tell you that that soda-drinking hat you possess is cursed.
Mr. Krabs	Uh... Smitty Werben... Jaegerman... Jensen.
Mr. Krabs	Yes...
Mr. Krabs	What?! There is no Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen!
Mr. Krabs	No, not that!
Mr. Krabs	What? No way. Just crawl back into your hole, bone boy. Go ahead, play dead.
Mr. Krabs	No flipping way!  Back off! Back off, I say.
Mr. Krabs	C'mon, Mr. Doodles. We haven't got all day. We've got to get down to me favorite restaurant. Mine. Where we're shooting our first ever Krusty Krab commercial. After this commercial airs, we'll be swarming with customers. I can already feel myself sweatin' money.
Mr. Krabs	What you're doing is throwing away me money! I told you to rent, only, what is absolutely necessary.
Mr. Krabs	Well, you got me there. But why do we need him?
Mr. Krabs	What are you doing, lad?
Mr. Krabs	Yup, I got a sweet deal on the prime-time slot.
Mr. Krabs	That's right, Krusty Krab. Home of the world famous Krabby Patty!
Mr. Krabs	How do you like them Krabby Patties, girls?
Mr. Krabs	I need you to...  ...OW!  Alright, boy. Get in there and scrub the head and stop acting so predictable.
Mr. Krabs	What in blazes are you talking about?
Mr. Krabs	Well, SpongeBob, looks like you've finally found your calling.
Mr. Krabs	Let's see...  ...5, 10, 25, blue, applesauce. Everything looks to be in order...except, , where is it?  Where is it?
Mr. Krabs	Me? I ain't saying nothing that would matter to anyone who would be able to take a lie detector test!
Mr. Krabs	Show me your tentacles.
Mr. Krabs	Donate to the children's fund? Why? What have children ever done for me?
Mr. Krabs	"Me first dime. Oh, ""dimey"", I'll never lose you again."
Mr. Krabs	Well, Mr. Squidward, it's good to have ya back.
Mr. Krabs	Well, it's obvious that ya put the dime in me pants. Dimes just don't fly into peoples' pants.
Mr. Krabs	Oh, boo-hoo! Let me play a sad song for you on the world's smallest violin.
Mr. Krabs	Why didn't you tell me? We'll take him to the cleaners.
Mr. Krabs	That's the appetizer.
Mr. Krabs	How about a little music to count me money to?
Mr. Krabs	Come on, little buddy, play it again.  Please? One more time, for me.
Mr. Krabs	Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop,  bee-boo-boo-bop,  boo-boo-bee-bop?  Not bee-boo-boo-beep?  Bop?  Beep?  Boo-boo-bop?
Mr. Krabs	Well, let's hear it, lad.
Mr. Krabs	What? What is it, boy?
Mr. Krabs	Get back to work, Mr. Squidward.
Mr. Krabs	Ah, that's better.  Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop.
Mr. Krabs	What are you talking about? I'm Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs	I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am!
Mr. Krabs	You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy.
Mr. Krabs	No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50!  $62.67!  Four... well, actually, that one was a gift.  Nooo!
Mr. Krabs	Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share!
Mr. Krabs	What stupid barnacle told you that?
Mr. Krabs	Secret...?
Mr. Krabs	But, let me give you two a warning. This here paint is absolutely permanent.  It will never come off. So if I see even one drop on anything but wall, I'll have your rear ends cut off...  AND MOUNTED OVER ME FIREPLACE!!!! So, have fun with the job.
Mr. Krabs	Flippin' fish fossils! look what you did!
Mr. Krabs	And you boys thought I wouldn't notice. Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right boys, you're free to go.  Ow!!!!! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.
Mr. Krabs	Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?
Mr. Krabs	There we go, good as new.
Mr. Krabs	Oh... that's ok, honey. We weren't going there anyway. THAT'S where we're going!
Mr. Krabs	See you fellows tomorrow! Gourmet know-how!
Mr. Krabs	Well, I could be asking you the same thing, boy.
Mr. Krabs	One at a time, one at a time, please! Kenny the Cat will have time to meet each and every one of you's. And I will have time to take each and every one of your dollars. Look at myself. I'm not being a very good host. Uh,excuse me. You just make yourself at home, Kenny. I mean, Mr. the Cat. Here you go! Condiments. On the house. Don't tell anybody. Welcome to the Krusty Krab family.
Mr. Krabs	I'm introducing a new Krusty Krab promotion.
Mr. Krabs	Ugh! For crying out loud, Squidward, what the heck is wrong with you?
Mr. Krabs	What?!
Mr. Krabs	What kind of things?
Mr. Krabs	It means there's something wrong with your head. Look, I think maybe you should see a professional.
Mr. Krabs	Hello, I'm Mr. Krabs, and I like money.
Mr. Krabs	Yeah. Get out!
Mr. Krabs	Remember what I told you, boy? Keep your eye on the key.
Narrator	Welcome aboard. If you're watching this video, then let me be the first to say: Congratulations!  You've recently been hired in the Krusty Krab  and this is your first official day of training.
Narrator	Sounds like a...
Narrator	Training.
Narrator	Looks like Mr. SquarePants understands POOP.  Here's a typical customer. I wonder what he wants. Well, if we just remember POOP, we can figure it out.
Narrator	Ha-ha! Not so fast, Eager McBeaver. We haven't even talked about:  Personal Hygiene.  Every employee at the Krusty Krab must comply with a strict set of personal hygiene guidelines.  Okay, Mr. SquarePants, are you ready to prepare for your shift?  A good employee always washes himself thoroughly. Be sure to get under those fingernails.  And don't forget about the knuckles.  And make sure those palms are squeaky clean.  All right, let's see those hands.  Now that's thorough!  After making sure your boots are polished, your face is clear of any blemishes or boils,  and your hair is neat and tidy,  you are ready to start the day. Now let's see how Squidward prepares for his shift.  Remember, no employee wants to be a Squidward!  Now that you're clean and hygienic, I bet you think you're ready to make that Krabby Patty.
Narrator	Good job, Mr. SquarePants!
Narrator	Ah-ah-ah, Squidward, remember what Mr. Krabs says.
Narrator	And so, another emergency is avoided, thanks to Mr. SquarePants.  Let's check in on Squidward again. Psst, Squidward.
Narrator	Welcome to SpongeBob's House Party, with your host, Patchy the Pirate. There'll be punch, cookies, explosions, and a brand-new episode of SpongeBob SquarePants!
Narrator	While Patchy pulls himself together, let's see how SpongeBob's party is shaping up.
Narrator	The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.  In a familiar restaurant, in a familiar part of town, a call goes out in frustration.
Narrator	Captain Magma...get him angry and he's bound to erupt!
Narrator	The International Justice League of Super Acquaintances! A subsidiary of Viacom.
Narrator	Ah, dawn breaks over the primordial sea.  It's here that millions of years ago, life began taking its first clumsy steps out of the darkness, opening its newly- formed eyeballs to stare into the blinding light of intelligence, in order to- Umm... never mind. This happened a long time ago.
Narrator	Welcome back to SpongeBob SquarePants B.C. Sounds like things have gone from bad to worse for Patchy. Let's watch!
Narrator	Two hours later...
Narrator	Ah, the Krusty Krab. Home of the delicious Krabby Patty and its super-secret recipe.
Narrator	Later that same evening.
Narrator	6 Months Later...
Narrator	4 to 6 weeks later.
Narrator	One debt to society later...
Narrator	One pair of pants later...
Narrator	298 frozen patties later...
Narrator	"Ahoy, mateys! Today I'll be spinning a tale you won't soon forget.  It's called ""SpongeBob SquarePants Vs. The Patty Gadget"". Now, SpongeBob was workin', his eye on the grill, 'til he heard a sharp sound that gave him a chill."
Narrator	With three little words, Krabs started the show. Flag raised in the air, he cried...
Narrator	A noise and a clatter came from the machine, and out popped the patties in a burst of hot steam. The gadget was fast, its first batch completed, but SpongeBob yelled out...
Narrator	The gizmo, it shuddered. It clattered, it shook. And as Squidward laughed:
Narrator	Then he held up two spatulas and leapt like a spring. His hands were a blur, the patties went flying. He fried up a hundred with out even trying. Squidward was worried. SpongeBob couldn't be beat.
Narrator	The patties came flying, by twos and by threes, by dozens, by hundreds, oh, it was something to see. Aye, that machine, it was fast, but SpongeBob was faster. He proved to that thing that he was its master.  The gadget blew into bits and died with a boom. The blast was so loud, it woke King Neptune.
Narrator	Epilogue.
Narrator	346 minutes later.
Narrator	Of course you do, Man Ray.   Everyone loves the new Krusty Kids Meal.  And for a limited time,  get your free toy inside.
Narrator	One week later
Narrator	Three days later.
Narrator	Ahh, lunchtime at the Krusty Krab. Everyone is enjoying their Krabby Patties.  Huh?! What's this?
Narrator	48 hours later.
Narrator	Others...

Narrator	72 hours later.
Narrator	Just then... By sheer coincidence...
Narrator	Fishermen have quite an effect on our undersea friends.
Narrator	And now, Astrology with Squidward.
Narrator	And now, Astrology with Squidward.
Narrator	Now every toon down in Toonville liked Nickmas a lot. But Angelica who lived just north did not. It could be her pigtails were pulled too tight.It could be Cynthia got lost one nightBut the real reason most folks would concurIs she thought all the chocolate should be just for her.As she looked down at all the toon cheer.She had thoughts of stealing Nickmas this year.So she hopped on her Malibu Cynthia sleigh.And took off for Nickville that very dayShe snuck through Toonville and very soon.She was stealing chocolate from every NickToon.A chocolate helmet, a chocolate boardChocolate figure of UltralordChocolate patties on a chocolate grillChocolate worms from Phil and LilChocolate chalk from Rudy's workChocolate from all around the earth.But just as she finished stealing her haul.Out came the little NickToon of allLittle Plankton Loo WhoWho had one eye not two who.
Narrator	And now, SpongeBob checks his Instaclam.
Narrator	Today, my friends, we welcome you to the museum of cartoon sponges. What you're about to witness is a rare collection of fine art depicting a legendary yellow sponge by the name of SpongeBob, who wears square pants.
Narrator	But how do you know if you're really from Bikini Bottom?  You know you are from Bikini Bottom when... this is how you drive.
Narrator	You know you are from Bikini Bottom when... you love Krabby Patties!
Narrator	With just a couple minor adjustments, anyone can go from yokel to tough guy!
Narrator	...tough guy hat , gloves , bandanna , boots , and lastly that ol' tough guy scowl .
Narrator	What if SpongeBob was gone?
Narrator	So you thought I was kidding, huh? No, in Bikini Bottom, excellence can be found, even under a rock.
Narrator	Every day is a holiday for SpongeBob, even if he has to make one up.
Narrator	Two Days Later.....
Narrator	Six and a half hours later...
Narrator	Perhaps she should have asked someone else.
Narrator	You can ask this sincere sea star and his magic rock anything, and he'll certainly have an answer for you.
Narrator	Now you think of a question. That's right. You. Any question, got it? Ask now!
Narrator	What say you now, all seeing Patrick?
Narrator	They certainly are, Patrick. They certainly are.
Narrator	"Number 2: ""Reverence"""
Narrator	"Number 5: ""Gratitude"""
Narrator	"With these 7 life strategies, you'll be sponge-errific, sponge-tastic, sponge-elicious even. But when in doubt, remember the SpongeBob Mantra: ""I'm ready! I'm ready!"" Good, now you're ready to living squarer, yellower, and spongier everyday! Repeat after SpongeBob: ""I'm ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready!"""
Narrator	Everyday, artists are hard at work drawing every frame of SpongeBob.
Narrator	Once the backgrounds are painted and the frames are colored,they're all put together in the computer, and SpongeBob and the gang come to life.
Narrator	Well, it looks like Patchy's pretty busy at the moment, so I'll say it for him. Good night, and happy holidays.
Narrator	As seen in episode 17!
Narrator	Free... light bulbs?
Narrator	A few inches later...
Narrator	Day three.
Narrator	One eternity later...
Narrator	The starfish then sheds his winter coat  and stores it away safe for winter.
Narrator	Oh, a dark and stormy night. It's nights like these that remind me of the time Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob thought they killed the health inspector.  It was a bright and sunny morning.
Narrator	And also these guys.
Narrator	3:28 am
Narrator	Many months later...
Narrator	Tomorrow for sure...
Narrator	12:00 midnight.
Narrator	Two hours later...
Narrator	8:01 PM.
Narrator	Here we see the proud jellyfish hunter.  He stands motionless to lure the jellyfish into a false sense of security.  And when his prey ventures to close, he springs into action.
Narrator	Two hours later.
Narrator	Twenty-four hours later...
Narrator	A lot of boring math later...
Narrator	The next morning...
Narrator	End of flashback...
Narrator	Later...
Narrator	Ahh, a happy pineapple under the sea. Let's take a peek inside, shall we?
Narrator	4 to 6 days later...
Narrator	The next morning...
Narrator	One semester later...
Narrator	3,000 Wup-poos later...
Narrator	Moments later...
Narrator	Many unbearable hours later...
Narrator	And lastly, please respect the kind jellyfish.
Narrator	Ah, the sea. So mysterious, so beautiful. So... uhh... wet.  Our story begins in Bikini Bottom's popular undersea eatery, the Krusty Krab restaurant, where...
Narrator	Well, well, what is this? Ah, the artist at sea. Let us watch and see the fruits of his struggle. Ah, it seems that inspiration has struck.
Narrator	The second most important rule for the artist at sea: Always bring a pencil sharpener.
Narrator	Ahh, another peaceful evening in Bikini Bottom. Listen to the tropical tranquility.  Uh-oh.
Patrick	Go, SpongeBob!  Whoa!
Patrick	"Whose first words were ""may I take your order""?"
Patrick	Who's ready?
Patrick	Good morning, Krusty Krew!
Patrick	Squidward, your ceiling is talking to me!
Patrick	Uhh... uhhhh...
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Not bad, not bad.
Patrick	Nice to meet you Patrick.
Patrick	"""Nod politely."""
Patrick	Hello, SquarePants residence. What? I'm sorry, what?
Patrick	Sorry, he's not out there.
Patrick	Oh, without a doubt, you are the best party-thrower ever!
Patrick	This guy's got shoes!
Patrick	A chocolate bar?
Patrick	We'll take twenty!
Patrick	Yeah, he did... I'm going back to buy more bags!
Patrick	We got him now!
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	Focusing.
Patrick	Eat Barnacle Chips, they're delicious.
Patrick	The kill!
Patrick	It'll keep your face from getting any uglier.
Patrick	This'll be the best lie yet!
Patrick	Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?
Patrick	I can finally touch my toes!
Patrick	Four!
Patrick	Well, what am I supposed to do all day while you're at school?
Patrick	Wow.
Patrick	Where is everyone?
Patrick	Ohh!
Patrick	But look at all the stars you have! I'll never be that good.
Patrick	Life! death! Life! death! Life! death! Life! death! Life! death!
Patrick	Who's the fat kid talking to?
Patrick	Uh...uh...UH!...24!
Patrick	24.
Patrick	Mrs. Puff, is it naptime?
Patrick	SpongeBob, over here!
Patrick	Hey buddy! Funny stuff in there, funny stuff!
Patrick	I don't see anyone fighting, do you?
Patrick	I hate you more.
Patrick	Ohh...  Hmph!
Patrick	Me too! Let's save Roger!
Patrick	Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class! See ya, SpongeBob. See ya, Big Fat Meanie.
Patrick	Sunday?
Patrick	Yeah, I should get a snail and enter it in that race and beat Squidward!
Patrick	Excuse me, but you two seem to be forgetting who the real winner will be... my snail.
Patrick	You can run, but you can't hide, SquarePants!
Patrick	This is what you've been training for, Rocky. This is why we're here.
Patrick	Good morning, Krusty Krew!
Patrick	Well, how rude of some people!
Patrick	Yes.
Patrick	I'm waiting... old man.
Patrick	I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?
Patrick	Sorry.
Patrick	I said, I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.
Patrick	Give us some credit, old man. We're panty professionals!
Patrick	Squid's taking it real hard. So what are you gonna do now?
Patrick	Ow! Ow! Ow!
Patrick	No.
Patrick	Yeah! We'll be rockmates!  Good night, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Aww, I got dead again! This game stinks!
Patrick	Not until 4.
Patrick	That's not crazy talk. This is crazy talk!  Sorry.
Patrick	Never ever ever ever ever for never ever?!
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	That penny has the most beautiful voice.
Patrick	Still two ice creams!
Patrick	Right!
Patrick	Of course!
Patrick	Yummy!  Patrick to SpongeBob. The deliciousness has landed!
Patrick	Sing another song...
Patrick	Well, maybe it is stupid, but it's also dumb!
Patrick	...in a goofy fashion!
Patrick	Duh!
Patrick	Yeah. Sea bears often attack more than once.
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob!
Patrick	That wasn't part of the deal, SquarePants!
Patrick	"I got it, I got it. You're gonna retrace your steps and when you walk by me I say ""hi"", just like this morning."
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Hi, Patrick! Oh wait, I'm Patrick! I'm sorry. Sorry.  I'm sorry. Let's try it again.  Hi, SpongeBoob! Ha! SpongeBoob! I sai... I sai...  Who's SpongeBoob? I said SpongeBoob! Again, again. Sorry people.  I've got the giggles.
Patrick	Well, then we'll look in the dumpster!
Patrick	Cannonball!
Patrick	I'm looking as fast as I can.
Patrick	Could I have another hint?
Patrick	Uh... I can't remember.
Patrick	Could you give me a hint?  There! I see it!
Patrick	What's that contraption, SpongeBob?
Patrick	We better do what he says. He knows how to grow food!
Patrick	Can we have the cake now?  Happy, happy birthday to you!
Patrick	Nice try, SquarePants, but it's not gonna work this time. I'm gonna have some of your delicious Seanut Brittle!  Where's the Seanut Brittle?
Patrick	I don't get it.
Patrick	What are we gonna do with it?
Patrick	Well, that stuff stains clothes, right?
Patrick	Hey, the invisible spray works!
Patrick	Oh hey, I think this thing is empty.
Patrick	Gee, it's getting late.
Patrick	Hey, I'm no ghost! The nerve of that guy and his driving eyeballs.
Patrick	Who's gonna be our next victim?
Patrick	Nice try, Krabs, but we replaced all the glass with rubber.
Patrick	Me too.
Patrick	Leaping lampreys, Mermaid Man. I'm right behind you.
Patrick	Right, Mermaid Man.
Patrick	It's too bad they're old.
Patrick	Hold it right there, ma'am. I'll be taking that.
Patrick	It's the Raging Whirlpool.
Patrick	No problem, buddy. I always wanted to go to a mattress store.
Patrick	Hey, you didn't even help pay.
Patrick	Nope.
Patrick	What a dump.
Patrick	Hey, wait a minute, what are you gonna do?
Patrick	Where? I can't see them.
Patrick	Why are we called 'Worm-bait?'
Patrick	Ohh, SpongeBob, he likes your wooden spoon.
Patrick	That guard worm doesn't look very happy.
Patrick	What are you doing?
Patrick	I haven't seen SpongeBob in a couple days. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I remembered what I wanted to tell him.  That's strange. Usually, I knock on the with this hand.  Hey, SpongeBob, you around? SpongeBob?
Patrick	SpongeBob, what happened?  This picture is crooked. SpongeBob!
Patrick	You what?
Patrick	I won. But then I lost the trophy they sent me.
Patrick	About a week.
Patrick	Eight?
Patrick	No, but I'll keep looking.
Patrick	What is it?
Patrick	But I thought you drove him away with your neglect and indifference.
Patrick	Old lady, quick. I'm looking for the scented pine cones. It's an emergency!
Patrick	Just let it out, buddy. That's right.
Patrick	Secret ritual.
Patrick	Our new president is a genius!
Patrick	It is a lovely day for a ride in the country.
Patrick	Danger!?
Patrick	Wow! Squidward's house is destroying the neighborhood!
Patrick	Sure, Sandy.
Patrick	Hey, what the...
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Look, he's waking up.
Patrick	Nope.
Patrick	Nuh-uh.
Patrick	What does a guy have to do get some mutton around here? I'm starving!
Patrick	Yay!
Patrick	I guess this is what you call the royal treatment.
Patrick	This is awesome.  Hey, SpongeBob, get out here!  Whoa, SpongeBob you look incredible.
Patrick	No! No! No!
Patrick	Yay!  Hey!
Patrick	Try telling that to Squidly.
Patrick	And they weren't nice to them either.
Patrick	Oh, oh, oh...
Patrick	And it's underground...
Patrick	I have an idea. Let's make it longer!
Patrick	Good morning, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Oh, that's a lens cap.
Patrick	Huh?  Duuhh... aaann... ger...  cliff!
Patrick	Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep.
Patrick	Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature.
Patrick	Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?
Patrick	Ok, one Krabby Patty and one room with cheese. Oh, and can I get cheese on the Krabby Patty, too?
Patrick	Oh, ok.  Do you mind?!  Don't look!  Done!
Patrick	What about my Krabby Patty?
Patrick	Squidward, wait!  Keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from.
Patrick	I don't like crusts on my sandwich!
Patrick	Good idea, Squidward!
Patrick	Squidward, wait! The toilet's backed up again!
Patrick	That was a hotel?
Patrick	My pants!
Patrick	Let me try!
Patrick	What's it saying?
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	SpongeBob, I know this one will work. I've invented a parallel universe.
Patrick	I have no idea what you're talking about.
Patrick	And I am Professor Patrick.
Patrick	That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick to you!
Patrick	Step right up.  You look like you've been neglecting your personal hygiene.
Patrick	Thank you, lowly assistant.
Patrick	That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.
Patrick	Oh my gosh. Who said that?
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob! I got my wish.
Patrick	Tag, you're it.
Patrick	And I fell on my head.
Patrick	It's the only thing I've ever done.
Patrick	Tag, you're it.
Patrick	I don't get it.
Patrick	Ho, ho, ho!
Patrick	And stop stepping in my potato salad.
Patrick	Lucky.
Patrick	SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
Patrick	What crime?  I'm a bad person!
Patrick	Hmmm...
Patrick	Yeah, uh huh.
Patrick	I don't wanna be a policeman anymore! I'm scared!
Patrick	Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo.  Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!
Patrick	The maniac's in the mailbox!
Patrick	Tell me, do you have any soreness of throat?
Patrick	That mad snail is coming! If he bites you, you'll turn into a zombie.
Patrick	Perhaps not. Now, I got my eye on you!
Patrick	Well, does that mean we're not zombies?
Patrick	Ok, boss.
Patrick	Hello? Hello? Hello?  Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear.  Hey, I just cleaned that one.
Patrick	SpongeBob? Is that you?
Patrick	I'm saving you from that brain-eating alien that's attacking your...  ...head!
Patrick	Then what is it?
Patrick	Look at my new wig.
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Oh, man! Could you guard it from the inside?
Patrick	Sandy's grown to gigantic size!
Patrick	She's in there?  I'll save you, Sandy!
Patrick	Finished.
Patrick	What plan?
Patrick	Squidward, the toilet's backed up again.
Patrick	I gotta get going! He told me to!
Patrick	I guess I'll pack up my stuff and get ready to go.  My clothes.
Patrick	It's the end of me. Being here.
Patrick	Huh?  There ya go, Patrick. No one will know it's you.  Patrick, you okay?
Patrick	Oh, I know, I know! I could be Mr. Seaweed Monsterman. And live happily forever after in Bikini Bottom.
Patrick	No.
Patrick	Yeah. We're here...
Patrick	Is he the bad guy?
Patrick	Squidward?
Patrick	Yeah, help him. Go away. Can't you tell nobody wants you? You're endangered.
Patrick	Ah! He can come home with me.
Patrick	Oh, yeah.  This one, right?
Patrick	What! I can't hear you! I'm screaming too loud!
Patrick	Hey, I see light.
Patrick	That's awful. How tragic. Poor Squidward.
Patrick	Oh, sorry.
Patrick	[examines the torn box] Warning: From ages 9 to 99.
Patrick	We could always eat him. I'm kind of hungry.
Patrick	Hey, learning tastes good.
Patrick	Who's a winner?
Patrick	How'd you do, winner?  Let's see that license.
Patrick	We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself.
Patrick	SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
Patrick	Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license.
Patrick	Does that mean I get a free key chain?
Patrick	Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat.
Patrick	Then you can get a free boat just like me.
Patrick	No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian.
Patrick	Yeah!  But that's not all.
Patrick	Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license.
Patrick	Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image.
Patrick	Oh!
Patrick	SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it.
Patrick	Yeah, yeah.
Patrick	I think the driving genius knows what he's doing!
Patrick	I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face!
Patrick	So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.
Patrick	It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.
Patrick	Yeah?
Patrick	I have to get rid of these books!
Patrick	Ooh, what is it?  This is the worst-tasting gift ever!
Patrick	Anything I want?  SpongeBob, do you think we can get something to eat?
Patrick	Tasty.
Patrick	Are you gonna eat that?
Patrick	I thought you said I could have anything I want. Was my bestest friend lying to me?
Patrick	No, she won't be, because these comic books are mine!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Your front yard?
Patrick	[rage takes over] My royal subjects have deserted me. And it's all 'cause of that horrible Squidward. This is all his fault. His, his, not mine, his!
Patrick	Huh?  I thought you were going to say I was abusing my power.
Patrick	Aaah, help! Monster! Monster!  Huh? Oh, it's, it's you!  Here, here, take it. I don't want it anymore. It's turned me into a monster.
Patrick	Hello, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Hello, SpongeBob. Bloodthirsty bikers! We got to hide!
Patrick	No, me!
Patrick	Those bikers think they're so tough. With their leather hats  and their leather pants
Patrick	I wouldn't mess with ya.
Patrick	I'm bloodthirsty. See?  Want some?
Patrick	Uhh, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Good night, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Oh, sorry.  Did you get your net yet?
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, did you get Ol' Reliable back yet?
Patrick	Wow, thanks, SpongeBob!
Patrick	I've said too much already.
Patrick	I'm in here. Be out in a second.
Patrick	Nothing in my other hand.
Patrick	Good morning, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob. What are you doing?
Patrick	OK, bye!  Hello! Who are you?
Patrick	I don't know who you are, but I'm not giving you this jellyfishing net.  I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars, not for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't even sell it for a dollar.
Patrick	SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. There was this scary guy with a mustache asking a lot of weird questions.
Patrick	How could you think that?
Patrick	I'm not your best friend. I'm just a no-good jelly netting thief fish!
Patrick	You're giving me Ol' Reliable?  I accept your apology!
Patrick	Squidward, you look a little different. Wow. Have you been working out?
Patrick	For me?
Patrick	But then you... Uh, what'd you do again?
Patrick	This chewing gum is my most beloved possession, and I'm giving it to my bestest friend, on Best Friends Day.
Patrick	Aww, don't be so hard on yourself, SpongeBob. I love my gift. In fact, I'll go play with it right now. Come on, Robo.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, whatcha doing?
Patrick	Hmmm. Bold yet understated. Brilliant idea, SpongeBob. Keep up the good work. Come on, Robo, let's find more belly button lint.
Patrick	By the way, your house looks a million times better.
Patrick	Enough already. Sheesh. So, you were saying something, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Uh-huh.
Patrick	SpongeBob's having a party without me?  Hmph! Throw a party without your best friend? Oh, we'll just see about that.
Patrick	Thank you, my good man.
Patrick	Well, in that case, we'll need even more lights!
Patrick	Barnacle Boy!?!
Patrick	Huh? What? Huh? No!!  What's making that noise? Hu-huh?  Oh.  It's you again.  Okay, joke's over.  Alright, you got me. Now cut it out.  That's it!  Stop your ringing, mister! I'm warning you. Stop it! I said quit it!  Where's it coming from? Make it stop.  You've got to help me find out where that ringing is coming from.  Hey, come back! Oh, fine. I'll ask someone who cares.  SpongeBob, where's that ringing coming from?  Breakfast!  Come to Patrick!  Tartar sauce. I'm out of food again. All I have is these lousy cans with pictures of food on them. I wanted real food not pictures!  Oh. The food is in the can. Okay, come on out. Come on. Oh, yeah.  Okay, breakfast, get on the plate. Come on. Nice, comfy plate just for you. Come on, get on there. Hello? Anybody in there?  No answer. I'm coming to rescue you.  Having a little trouble reaching you.  You stupid cans.  Oh. Food. Ah, my favorite time of the day. Breakfast and a little morning television.
Patrick	Hiya, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Well, I guess you won't be needing this alien repellent for your trip!
Patrick	Wow. How do you think we get inside?
Patrick	Woo-hoo! Winner! Yeah! High score!
Patrick	More! More!
Patrick	Hold on, buddy!  Hey, we stopped falling!
Patrick	All right!
Patrick	You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud.
Patrick	Stinky.
Patrick	Eww, gross.
Patrick	I didn't even know!
Patrick	SpongeBob, what are we waiting for?
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, I'm hungry.
Patrick	Oh, I'm gonna take off then. I don't think my arm can stand much more of this.
Patrick	Yeah, see?  Here's a present and your cake.
Patrick	Actually, you've only been here 20 minutes.
Patrick	I said he's having a moment! Now leave him alone!
Patrick	SpongeBob?
Patrick	I'm sorry. Oh, maybe if you just...
Patrick	SpongeBob! What is that?
Patrick	Uhh, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Sure do! Well, I gotta go sit in my hole. Catch ya later, pal.
Patrick	Sorry. Hey, wanna play a game of pirate wrestling?
Patrick	I've got an idea!
Patrick	You're a spy?!  I wanna be a spy, too!!!
Patrick	What's he doing now?
Patrick	Can do!
Patrick	It's for you.
Patrick	I am. You need to be quiet. We're on a secret mission.
Patrick	No, thank you.
Patrick	Not so fast!
Patrick	Hey, Squidward. Parcheesi?
Patrick	SpongeBob, you gotta see this. It's an emergency broadcast on my TV.
Patrick	Really? Me too!
Patrick	Yeah, I can't wait to ride it.
Patrick	Oh, I know! Let's go on some of the dumb kiddie rides first.
Patrick	Nuh-uh.
Patrick	I guess that ride was too much for the little guy.
Patrick	And I went three times all by myself.
Patrick	Want some?
Patrick	Oh, yeah?  I thought we'd settled this the last time!
Patrick	Yep.
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.
Patrick	We survived the Fist o' Pain!
Patrick	Plankton says he needs our artistic vision.
Patrick	SpongeBob, how about another game of  tie your best buddy in knots.  My turn.
Patrick	Oh, barnacles! What am I going to do with all this dip?
Patrick	Let's do it again.
Patrick	He's probably happy about his new glasses.
Patrick	I want you to pull yourself together, okay? And then I want you to--
Patrick	He's too proud.
Patrick	What did I miss?
Patrick	We're gonna win the trophy.
Patrick	Whoa.
Patrick	Thanks.
Patrick	Oh.  Nothing satisfies like a good story.
Patrick	Well, whatever it is, it's mine! Unless I don't want it!  SpongeBob, what do all these words say?
Patrick	I want to send in a poem, and everyone would love it, and I would be a star!
Patrick	I wish not to be disturbed, SpongeBob, for I am about to erupt with a masterpiece.
Patrick	I think I wrote a poem once.
Patrick	I've never told anyone this, I wrote a poem once.
Patrick	If you're serious, I can do this. I'm even gonna use my brain.
Patrick	That's the creative process at work!  Ready to go to the post office?  I need to mail in my masterpiece.
Patrick	Yeah! And me too! Now sit down and get comfortable.
Patrick	That was awesome! Did you like it or did you really, really like it? Give me your completely honest opinion of how great it was.
Patrick	I can't wait to see look on their face once they hear this.
Patrick	Carry me?
Patrick	Oh, yeah. I forgot.
Patrick	Fan club?  Yee-whoo! We should sing them a song!
Patrick	Uh-oh.
Patrick	Tejas!
Patrick	Wa-hey!
Patrick	I've been bit by a vampire flea!  No!  I'm gonna turn into a vampire now!  It's already happening! Ah, ah!
Patrick	Wah!
Patrick	It's gonna be all right.  We will help you.  Okay, you know what? None of this would have happened if you didn't come back with your infestation! All you've brought us is fleas, and trouble and pain and itching and a rash. And pain and fleas and itching and... pain. So... much... pain. So much pain. And as for you.  If you hadn't thrown this party, we wouldn't be in this mess.
Patrick	You're right. I have an idea. SpongeBob, you get on Sandy's shoulders.  Uh-huh. Good. Now, I'll get on top of you!  Ah...  Ahhh... Much better.  Whoa!
Patrick	This is SpongeBob's delicious...  Wai... I 'ant eat 'is 'onut...!  It's SpongeBob's!
Patrick	Ah, don't watch that tape..!
Patrick	...The attic!  Wait... I don't have an attic!   Oh... Ooh! I know! the attic.
Patrick	No!  I took it, SpongeBob! I took your donut...! I'm sorry!
Patrick	Oh... Thanks, buddy!  Hey, Wanna share it?
Patrick	A-a-and these old phone books?
Patrick	"""Why thank you, Sandy, I would love one. [TAKE PATTY.]""  ""Too bad SpongeBob isn't here. These are his favorites. I sure wish he'd come home. [TAKE BITE.]""  I can't do it! SpongeBob! Come back!"
Patrick	If I can't have you as a friend, I'm gonna make you a trophy! I even picked out this nice jar for you!
Patrick	Patrick itchy!
Patrick	I'm ready.
Patrick	It Is?
Patrick	I hope it doesn't break until we get a little closer to the ground.
Patrick	Antis, Antis...SquarePantis! Probably belonged to your ancient ancestors.  SpongeBob SquarePantis, you must wear the ancient crest of your ancestors for it is your birth right!
Patrick	I'm Patrick, I'm Patrick, Patrick-Patrick-Patrick! And I like um, uuuuh,  I don't know what I like.
Patrick	Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'm coming to help you!
Patrick	Yeah! We almost popped the most prized possession of all Atlanteans!
Patrick	We destroyed your most prized possession!
Patrick	We sure did!
Patrick	Oh, sorry, SpongeBob. I just came over to borrow some jelly.
Patrick	We're here. Hey, what did I bring jelly for?
Patrick	I don't know.  What's happening to me?
Patrick	What's that?
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	How do I do that?
Patrick	Yup.
Patrick	SpongeBob, you're a genius!  Oh, no, there's one left.
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob. Hey, cool glasses. Can I try them on... oh!  SpongeBob, your eye. It's all black and swollen. How'd you mess your eye up, SpongeBob? Did somebody hit you? Where is he? Yeah, we'll settle this like men. We'll sue him.
Patrick	What did you do?
Patrick	I know exactly what you mean. You whooped him with your eyes closed.
Patrick	I'm gonna miss you, buddy!
Patrick	Yep!
Patrick	The food coma is setting in.
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	I... I like the other island better!
Patrick	What so?
Patrick	Gotcha.
Patrick	Oh for crying out loud SpongeBob, I didn't rush you when it was your turn!
Patrick	Aahh, good times.
Patrick	Hey SpongeBob.
Patrick	Something smells good. What are you cooking SpongeBob?
Patrick	You seemed kinda tense, so I drew you a hot bath.
Patrick	This isn't a bed!
Patrick	What?
Patrick	Beware! Let it be known to all far and wide, The mollusks are coming! Tally, ho!  The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! THE MOLLUSKS ARE COMING!
Patrick	It's too bad nobody listened to him.
Patrick	Another year older.
Patrick	Opposite Day? Hey, I've heard of that!
Patrick	Meow.
Patrick	Isn't it beautiful?
Patrick	Why, thank you, Mr. Squidward.
Patrick	Robert, Robert...uhh...Ronald, Ronald, Ryan.
Patrick	I wonder if I can order pizza with these things.
Patrick	I don't know, buddy!
Patrick	That's just Squidward sunbathing again.
Patrick	I'll say.
Patrick	No! Let go! I wanna drive!
Patrick	Now what?
Patrick	Oh, OK. What's an abyss, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Order... uh... up!
Patrick	SpongeBob, look!
Patrick	Where's your best friend now, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Noooo!!!! You're not my best friend!!!
Patrick	Well, duh, SpongeBob. It's only the most significant event in Bikini Bottom history! Long time ago, the town was divided into 2 groups  Those who spent their time washing their hands like softies
Patrick	Never have, never will.
Patrick	Here, I'll get it.
Patrick	No, thank you.  I happen to like my various smells and germs.
Patrick	Fine, me too!
Patrick	Do you give up yet, SpongeBob?
Patrick	There, you look good now.
Patrick	Who, me? My teeth are fine, see?
Patrick	My beautiful pit stink, it's gone! The gloves are off now.  It's booger time!
Patrick	Raw onions?!!  That does it!!  See this?
Patrick	Stinky, little feet
Patrick	Stay back, I'll do it!
Patrick	Slather toe jam on my armpits?
Patrick	Squeaky clean, squeaky, squeaky
Patrick	Oh, just a birthday cake for my mom that I spent all day baking. (Deleted) I'm gonna go back and make a 2nd b-day cake that my mom will like. Idiot Boy!
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	Huh? SpongeBob!  Oh, I knew I'd find you, buddy! Look at you. You haven't changed a bit. Let's go home and eat a gallon of seanut butter.
Patrick	You may not remember the weasel but you haven't forgotten your best friend, have you?
Patrick	We're not just neighbors.
Patrick	You bet! Now, where do you want these extra buns?
Patrick	That's it!  Come right in!
Patrick	Nothing at all?
Patrick	You're not worthy for instruction in the immobile arts. Leave my presence!
Patrick	Oh, hey Squidward, if you see SpongeBob, can you give him his brain back? I was borrowing it for the weekend. I'll just set it here.  See ya!
Patrick	I found out where boogers come from
Patrick	Yeah?
Patrick	And unlike your nasty, little wig  Mine is real!
Patrick	I'm on it.
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	What? Oh, oh it's you. Hey, how's it going buddy?
Patrick	Uhh... I don't know.  I'm funny.
Patrick	Yeah!  Ah. Much better.
Patrick	Hey, I broke my butt.
Patrick	Whatever that means. Hey, SpongeBob, what do you say we charge into Jellyfish Fields nets a-blaze?
Patrick	Look at my tongue.
Patrick	But first, I'll need a garden hose and a flatbed truck and I'll need you to remove your trousers.
Patrick	What's happening? The final transformation.
Patrick	Go away.
Patrick	Yeah. Everyone needs at least one day away from...
Patrick	Mm-hmm. I see. Well, I'm pretty booked today, but I think I can fit you in.
Patrick	Hmmm... interesting.
Patrick	So?
Patrick	There appears to be a little bit of swelling.  This garbage compress should help that go down.  That doesn't look good.  Yeah, but my shift is over.  Call me in the morning... if you can still dial the phone.
Patrick	He's only a block away.
Patrick	But what's that have...
Patrick	Where were you SpongeBob? That was awesome!
Patrick	Come on SpongeBob! What are you waiting for? Let's go!
Patrick	Don't you mean, cost us our lives SpongeBob?
Patrick	SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!  You were right SpongeBob! I went too far! I went too far!
Patrick	I don't know SpongeBob, this looks pretty dangerous.
Patrick	His mother must be so proud.
Patrick	Me first! Me first!
Patrick	What? Did somebody say something?
Patrick	Oh, it's you. You don't look too good.
Patrick	Hey, that's quitter talk Mr.! You're going to that party tonight! What you need, is a makeover!  A little Kelp Jerky? Open wide.  What do you think?
Patrick	Can't talk, working.
Patrick	Oh, sure thing pal. Hey everybody make some room! The floor's all yours. Knock 'em dead kid.
Patrick	Okay, Okay, jeez. Try to help a fella out. I'll just have to eat this ice cream cone instead.
Patrick	All done.
Patrick	Okay.
Patrick	Quite an improvement, don't you think?
Patrick	You're a saint, SpongeBob! A saint!
Patrick	Yeah, you'd be ugly again.
Patrick	Well, now his body is too small.
Patrick	Yeah! Yeah! You chase us!
Patrick	So?
Patrick	Give me! Give it here!
Patrick	Yeah, but all my friends have noses. You, Squidward, Sandy, even Mr. Krabs!
Patrick	Okay! Let's see. Hmm
Patrick	All these years I knew I was missing out on something, but I never thought smelling could be this good!  What is that horrible smell?  Onion rings?  The scent! Nobody told me about bad smells!  What is it now?  I'm going to have to re-think this whole smelling thing.  I made it. At least here at home, I can't be attacked by those wretched odors.  Bad smells are all around me!  I can not live in these conditions!
Patrick	To do what should have been done long ago. [delost?] Sweet Neptune, imported cheese!  This is in-excusable!  Yuck!
Patrick	You!
Patrick	This air freshener should finish the job.
Patrick	Take a bath, fleabag!
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	What?
Patrick	Good question.
Patrick	But we hear-ed what you've done.
Patrick	What's up?
Patrick	Yeah. You and Gary don't have a chance.
Patrick	Woof, woof!
Patrick	Almost up!
Patrick	Om.
Patrick	Will there be nachos there?
Patrick	Uh...
Patrick	Look! He's on top of that big... drinking fountain!
Patrick	This wind feels like broken glass mixed with razor blades!
Patrick	Time for those lessons to pay off!
Patrick	Sorry, SpongeBob. That wasnt me.
Patrick	I got the TV remote stuck in my throat!
Patrick	Well, SpongeBob, I think I might go catch a movie.
Patrick	Ill give you a hint: whats white, round, and comes out of clams?
Patrick	No, being called Patrick.
Patrick	Well, just dont take too long. We were just about to start playing with it.
Patrick	The last of what?
Patrick	Well, what he said was, How many times do I have to tell you not to stand there? But I knew what he meant.
Patrick	Really?
Patrick	Ice cream?
Patrick	Good day. Uh, your shoes untied.
Patrick	SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	Oh, the same thing us sea stars are usually doing, I guess. Laying up against a rock.
Patrick	Well, why didnt you say so, buddy? Ive been waiting for someone to go break in my new volleyball with!
Patrick	I don't know. What do you think it is?
Patrick	No, you peek first.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, how do I look?
Patrick	Whoo!
Patrick	And to pretend wrestle.
Patrick	What was that?
Patrick	A fist? Where?  Oh, yeah, that's definitely a...
Patrick	Hey, good one, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Good catch!
Patrick	Squeeze.
Patrick	No, I'm thinking about buying this book on counting. Three, four. What's gonna happen next? FIVE? Holy super-happy-fun-time! This book's good! I'll take it! One, two, three...
Patrick	It sure does the job, all right.
Patrick	Okay. Thanks, buddy.
Patrick	SpongeBob, you can't always expect my usual brand of stupidity. I like to mix it up. Keep you on your toes.
Patrick	I'd give you my most valuable possession?
Patrick	Well, good. 'Cause my landlord changed the lock again.
Patrick	Now, now, SpongeBob I know you wanna help, but you're my guest.  There! Nice and shiny!
Patrick	Oh! Pardon me! That hit the spot!  Hey! Look at that!  Sundown already? Well, you can have your card now. I hope you get as much use out of it as I have.
Patrick	Well, how about these?
Patrick	Oh! Hey, SpongeBob? Can I borrow one of those cards?  I locked myself out of my house again.
Patrick	Oh, well, can't you just skip a day? Just call in sick. Always works for Squidward.
Patrick	Oh! There's always the catch.  I need brain fuel! Ah! SpongeBob, how am I gonna feed my brain when all you have is your fancy bubbly water? Well, it'll have to do.
Patrick	Uh-huh.  Why?
Patrick	This is a shortcut.
Patrick	Ice cream!
Patrick	Hooray!
Patrick	Hold on.
Patrick	You still have your underwear.
Patrick	Thanks, SpongeBob. And it wasn't your fault either.
Patrick	Dog-pile on Squidward!
Patrick	We don't use our pinkies.
Patrick	After you, Brother SpongeBob.
Patrick	Hm. It's genius. But, I see one flaw in your plan.
Patrick	Roooo!
Patrick	But you'll have to pass the initiation again.
Patrick	You just missed the fire.
Patrick	No.
Patrick	SpongeBob?  No, you're not! SpongeBob has square pants. Now, leave me alone, you mysterious stranger.
Patrick	Your house? This house belongs to SpongeBob SquarePants. At least it did before he left us.  I wish I could see him one last time.
Patrick	Wow! That Mermerang really likes you!
Patrick	Certified!
Patrick	And Pat Boy!
Patrick	Everything! It's even fun just to say the word! Shee-uf-fle-boarde!
Patrick	Oh... ya, I forgot.  Well how come I didn't get a trophy?!
Patrick	Exactly. And with no one patrolling the town, who's gonna stop those youngsters from loitering?
Patrick	You're chewing too loud!
Patrick	Ohhhh!
Patrick	Oh, a, oh, actually, I think he was about to say Squid...
Patrick	No way! He's making that up! It was him!
Patrick	Uh-uh.
Patrick	Well, I don't know. Suits my needs.
Patrick	Yeah, we're sorry, Squidward.
Patrick	Uh, yeah, Squidward, it's...
Patrick	There it is!
Patrick	What are you worried about?  He looks better already.
Patrick	It kind of looks like...
Patrick	Look!
Patrick	Oh yes, Mr. Squidward's ghost! Please don't haunt us!
Patrick	What do you hunger for, master?
Patrick	Yes, your ghostliness!  This is fun.
Patrick	Where?
Patrick	We're going to go shopping?
Patrick	That again?
Patrick	Never mind! I've got an idea.
Patrick	Happy trails!
Patrick	Nice landing!  Darn, I missed! SpongeBob, look out for my body!
Patrick	There's nothing to be afraid of SpongeBob. It's just a little worm. See?
Patrick	Something tells me they don't like each other.
Patrick	That it is.
Patrick	Who're you talking to, buddy?
Patrick	"""Happy birthday""! It's today! My birthday's today!  Well, you surely must remember what you're gonna bring to my birthday, right?"
Patrick	I was just buying some birthday hats for my birthday party.  You didn't forget my party, did you?
Patrick	You finally made it!
Patrick	Well, what're you waiting for, buddy? Serve up the cake so I can tear into that present!
Patrick	No, no, you can't borrow my birthday present!
Patrick	Yeah, I'd like to know also! What kind of a birthday present is this?
Patrick	Why don't you just take it off so you don't have to go to work today?
Patrick	I'll show you, SpongeBob! I'll get a job and a hat!
Patrick	Sounds complicated, but if it gets me a work hat.  How's this?
Patrick	I did it! Did you see that Mr. Krabs?
Patrick	Sometimes when I'm nervous, I forget how to stand!
Patrick	I'm fine.
Patrick	I feel like a million BUCKS...
Patrick	Thanks pal.
Patrick	Ready!
Patrick	I dunno, Mr. Krabs.
Patrick	Thanks, Squidward! Oh, my hat. Gotcha! All right, back where you beloooong, aaaah! .
Patrick	You're giving me a raise.
Patrick	Thanks, SpongeBob! You're the best!
Patrick	No.
Patrick	Uh-uh.
Patrick	We hadn't thought of that one.
Patrick	Here it is!
Patrick	Not...open?
Patrick	Uh, no thanks. I'm good down here.
Patrick	Uh-huh.
Patrick	Huh! I'm not moving.
Patrick	We need to find a hiding spot where they'll never find us. And I know just the place.
Patrick	Yay! Oh, this is so awesome.
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	Yeah. Right, SpongeBob. I let you down, we find the light switch, and everything turns all peachy!
Patrick	Are we gonna hide in here for the rest of our lives?
Patrick	Let's get some!
Patrick	With Neptune as my witness, may you never experience the unholy terrors that are inside that store. Hey, they're open!  I love toys!
Patrick	The beach! Just you and me!?  So am I ready for the beach SpongeBob?
Patrick	Ohhh...hmmm... How about small plastic disc that you toss!?
Patrick	Like what?
Patrick	"That sounds  un-boring!"""
Patrick	Well, I don't need any help.
Patrick	Now this'll show SpongeBob that he's not the only one who can build a castle! Let's see SpongeBob destroy this castle!
Patrick	Now we're even... again!
Patrick	Whatever.  No no no no no.  Oh hello! And goodbye.
Patrick	The question is... will you be!?  No fair!
Patrick	Ohhhh. What happened?
Patrick	Yes, I can!
Patrick	CHUM IS... ME...
Patrick	It's kelp juice, you want some? . HEY! What kind of friend are you?
Patrick	It's about your sign. These words make my head sad.
Patrick	Oh right, congratulations, you have zero customers!
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	You got it boss!
Patrick	Oh... Gotcha. Hmmmmmm.
Patrick	"I know but I'm ""burned out."" See? Anyway, you can send my check to my home."
Patrick	A high school diploma?
Patrick	Well, duh. I don't want to miss my shows.
Patrick	Neighbor hug!
Patrick	I'm freaking out!
Patrick	And I'll just write my... myself down here for... forgiving up, too. Uh, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Through the freezer?
Patrick	Owie!
Patrick	No. Just kidding!
Patrick	Oh, SpongeBob, That reminds me. We should probably check the weather report before we go.
Patrick	You can say that again.
Patrick	I guess Squidward's not part of nature.
Patrick	That's better.
Patrick	He's right. You play rock, paper, scissors for it.
Patrick	Darn it! I'll get you next time.
Patrick	I'm not seeing anything there.
Patrick	Cannot complete jigsaw puzzle! Difficulty level too advanced. Rate of brain activity increasing. Ageing process by 30 years per second.
Patrick	Tell us.
Patrick	Yes!
Patrick	Oh, I almost forgot! Here's your Chum Kebab!
Patrick	Hmmm
Patrick	Are you going to take us for a ride?
Patrick	It's still standing.
Patrick	Tell me about it, I never get free food here.
Patrick	Ah no, but I like your idea better!
Patrick	Well SpongeBob that's...
Patrick	Wow!
Patrick	It varies.
Patrick	Doubt it.
Patrick	Upsy-daisy! Downsy-wounsy! Upsy-daisy! Downsy-wounsy!
Patrick	Hey SpongeBob, have you seen my rubber duckie?
Patrick	What do you need SpongeBob?
Patrick	Okay, ya know what, SquarePants? That's quitter talk. And are you a quitter?
Patrick	Hey SpongeBob, how was work?
Patrick	Bummer. Hey, ya know what? Forget this place. Let's go to the carnival. That's the funnest spot in the ocean.
Patrick	Thanks.  Woohoo!  Now you try.
Patrick	SpongeBob?
Patrick	You ruined my cotton candy!
Patrick	Okay, if that's how you feel... I won't help you anymore!
Patrick	SpongeBob! Snap out of it! It's me, your best friend, Patrick!
Patrick	Well, at least we're together! Heh. Hey, should I get the glue?
Patrick	Gotta... Have... Crunchity... Munchities...
Patrick	Nothing, it's just empty.
Patrick	I know, SpongeBob! Just do what I do when  looking for a job.  Kick back, watch some T.V.,  and chug down a carton on Drinkable Sausage!
Patrick	Why don't you get a job as a billboard?
Patrick	Why don't you find out?
Patrick	All right!
Patrick	Cuter than a regular Krabby Patty?
Patrick	Oh, crud! That's everything I got! .
Patrick	"I'm familiar with the concept of ""sharing""."
Patrick	Hey!  Where's the toy?
Patrick	Am I interrupting?
Patrick	Remember?  Sharing is the most wonderful feeling in the world, like dancing with a magical seahorse through an enchanted kelp garden  Remember those words, SpongeBob?
Patrick	No.
Patrick	Uh, I'm not home right now! Please leave a message! Beeeep!
Patrick	Looks fake to me pal! Bye-Bye now!
Patrick	I was too, see?  Nice dismount!
Patrick	Gary said that? You're off my friend list, Gary!!
Patrick	Mm-mm!
Patrick	Mm-mm!
Patrick	One.
Patrick	Most definitely.
Patrick	If I can't have it, no one can!
Patrick	Nuh-uh!
Patrick	Have you learned nothing about sharing?
Patrick	What is it?
Patrick	Is this a trowl?
Patrick	Your beard will just grow back.
Patrick	And Patrick! We're ghoooooooosts!  Ooohhhh!
Patrick	My eyelids...
Patrick	Invisible to the world!
Patrick	I don't get it...
Patrick	Must be all the pressure.
Patrick	Yup!
Patrick	Yeah, something.
Patrick	Well, I kinda feel the movement coming on myself.
Patrick	You bet! And it's highway convenient, too, according to that big sign!
Patrick	So what you're saying is, that if they go though with their plans, to build this new superhighway through Jellyfish Fields, that every single specie of flora & fauna that makes this place their habitat will be forced out of the ecosystem that they have formed, effectively being destroyed?
Patrick	Oh, it's when a bunch of people go walkin' on a street, an-
Patrick	It's a wig!
Patrick	You mean like a parade?
Patrick	Does this?!
Patrick	Im sure how to respond to that.
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	Great! You're going as my trick-or-treat bag!
Patrick	SpongeBob, look at my new paper ghost!  Oooh, scary.
Patrick	Okay, are you ready?
Patrick	Perfect. Now that's scary!  Let's go scare somebody.
Patrick	Oh boy, that was something. Your costume really packs a punch.
Patrick	Are you ready, SpongeBob?
Patrick	I am not SpongeBob. Those are my street clothes!
Patrick	Oh! What?!
Patrick	I Can't watch!
Patrick	Thank you Neptune!
Patrick	How can I help you?
Patrick	Oh, yeah.  Hey, good one, buddy. You almost had me there.
Patrick	Wow, what a great show.
Patrick	Oh, staring contest! I thought it was a blinking contest and I was losing.
Patrick	A common mistake, my good friend.  Allow me.  Ok, time to open this.
Patrick	Eh, Im indifferent.
Patrick	Eh, pudding.
Patrick	Snow globes are always funny.  Hey, you want to smell my armpit? There you go.
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	Okay.  Uh, I'd like you to meet my friend, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Yeah.  He's gonna smash your house now.
Patrick	Wait just one minute. This is my friend. If you want to get to him, you're gonna have to go through me.
Patrick	It really crushes my heart to see him go.
Patrick	The annual jellyfish convention in Ukulele Bottom this weekend!  So, you ready or what?
Patrick	Will you clam up?!
Patrick	Have you found my cuff links?
Patrick	Whoa.
Patrick	You go ahead SpongeBob. I think I'm gonna hang with the ladies a bit.
Patrick	There I was, walking along, just minding my own business and then BOOM!  Some dumbbell put this thing in the way.  Whatcha doing?
Patrick	Two little kids?
Patrick	Ohh, don't worry, we're not little kids. We're all grown up!  Hey! A baby tooth!
Patrick	So we've been looking for it!
Patrick	Dah-uhhh! 42. No, triangle! Meatballs! Screwdrivers! Pajamas!
Patrick	Wait for it to come to us.
Patrick	Owww. Oh.  Huh, I found it!
Patrick	Well, how do we know if this one is a fake?
Patrick	Yeah, We almost messed up big time. Pheeeww.
Patrick	SpongeBob, does that guy look suspicious to you?  I think he might be spying on us.  Hey, where'd he go!? All this suspicious thing is making me hungry.
Patrick	With pleasure. Prepare for a thorough search, shorty.
Patrick	You may not be a butler, but are you a werewolf?
Patrick	"I found it when I was cleaning your shorts from your little ""accident"" earlier."
Patrick	What a cool view.
Patrick	Great, now what?
Patrick	You can't hide forever.
Patrick	Hmm. In that case...
Patrick	I'm on it.  Maybe shoveling in these black rocks will help.
Patrick	Hey. Hey, wait for me...  Hey, SpongeBob!
Patrick	No offense, but your yard gargles tartar sauce.
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob.
Patrick	No.  SpongeBob?
Patrick	You're it!
Patrick	They're dancing!
Patrick	That'll do it
Patrick	You're welcome.
Patrick	Wheeeeeeee!
Patrick	Hey buddy. You still got that bucket of cheese?  Oh no! He's... not right! Don't worry, pal! I'll help you!
Patrick	Uhhuh!
Patrick	Then teach me.
Patrick	Woohoo! That was awesome!
Patrick	What?! I...!  Barnacles!
Patrick	Yeah! I bet I can chop anything!
Patrick	Yesss...
Patrick	Hi-yah SpongeBob!
Patrick	Looks delish.
Patrick	Uuuuuhhhhh... Seaweed Surprise! Also!... uuuuuuhhhhh... Malted Coral Crunch!  Oooh... Ooh, also, Lipids and Creme!
Patrick	NO! It's more fun to chop! Hahahahahahaha!
Patrick	SpongeBob, just the man I was looking for. I wanted to thank you, buddy.
Patrick	You got it, buddy. No more karate chops!
Patrick	HIYA YA! Not the muffin display... YAAAAH!
Patrick	I'm trying to but this thing has a mind of its owwwnnnn...  YAAAAAA!
Patrick	SpongeBob! Oh no!  Ohhh, I'll never forgive myself  No! I'll never forgive you!
Patrick	And in the spirit of healing, I vow to use my hands only to join things together, starting here!
Patrick	Sometimes you've got to make sacrifices.
Patrick	What didn't? Hey, look, a yo-yo!
Patrick	50 years? What are we gonna do till then?
Patrick	Forehead on yellow.
Patrick	"Nice try, Squidward, but we both already got that hiding spot figured out.  Whipped cream!  Oh, this whipped cream tastes awful!  ""Sha-veeng g-el."" I've always wanted a beard!"
Patrick	Trying to have a relaxing evening.
Patrick	Shocking!
Patrick	Oh, like that time when I was feeling depressed, and you let me eat all... I mean feed Gary for a week.
Patrick	A smoothie
Patrick	Ow!
Patrick	Oh man! That was the best time I've ever had!  Oh. Hello, SpongeBob. Did you enjoy not going to Glove World! with me?
Patrick	I don't know!
Patrick	I'm so confused!
Patrick	SpongeBob! Where are you?
Patrick	Hi, uhh...
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	Dozens?
Patrick	I didn't know hide-and-seek had so much mathematics.
Patrick	Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I do! I do know how to play!
Patrick	Hide and seek: a game played by two or more players in which one player chosen at random counts aloud to a pre-determined number while the remaining players hide. Upon reaching said number, the counting player now embarks on a search for the other players.  The search continues until all players are located and a winner is determined.
Patrick	Because... I don't have any socks!
Patrick	Seven, eight...
Patrick	Do you hear that? No what is that? Oh, it's SpongeBob. Why is he counting? I guess I'll just go home, maybe or later he'll want to play a game or something.
Patrick	I still have one question.
Patrick	Ewwww! We're all covered in slime!
Patrick	What are those things?
Patrick	Can't talk, Running!
Patrick	Uh, is this a trick question?
Patrick	It's in his eye!
Patrick	Oh, no. After you, old buddy.
Patrick	How did you know?
Patrick	Oh! What will his answer be?
Patrick	Aw, man! Pulled out the big guns. Color. Color.
Patrick	Oh, tricky, tricky. Hmm, right, or, left? Right-handed!
Patrick	Tartar sauce!
Patrick	I thought for sure I had that one.
Patrick	Oh! I got this one! Um, uh, can you repeat the question?
Patrick	Um, um, oh, jeez, trapezoid, pentagon, mormorphis...
Patrick	That was fast.  Don't worry buddy, there's plenty of fish in the street car.
Patrick	This is my worst nightmare!! I don't have a drink!
Patrick	I'm coming SpongeBob!
Patrick	Let's see. Where could SpongeBob be?  Aha!  Con-grat-ulations! You have-uh-ooh-fouuunnd-uh your friend!  Oh, SpongeBob is right behind this door! I'm coming to get you buddy!  SpongeBob?! Where-? Oh there you are!  Hang in there! I'll free you from your shackles!  You're okay now buddy! Go to your happy place! .
Patrick	Wow! I see you are a magician. But that voodoo does not erase what you just have done.
Patrick	You told me to sit on it.
Patrick	Are you gonna finish that?
Patrick	Oh, this game's too hard!
Patrick	I'm it!  SpongeBob!  Hang on, buddy, I'm coming! AHHHH!
Patrick	Ooh, shiny and smooth.
Patrick	Hmm, well, let's see.
Patrick	No. It's just a secret that everybody knows about.  What's wrong, SpongeBob?
Patrick	And alas, even the joyous shrieks of children cannot lift my sunken heart!
Patrick	And just when everyone was staring to find out about it, too.
Patrick	Oh! Ooh! Can you smell yourself think?
Patrick	Need a little extra cash if you know what I mean?
Patrick	A mobile is parked right in my front yard!
Patrick	Maybe we could visit him, later.
Patrick	Dinner is served.  Don't try to eat it. It's plastic.
Patrick	So, do you hang out here often?
Patrick	Cause I'm expecting some very important company.
Patrick	Sam took care of me when I was just nursing on coral. She was my... my... my... rock!
Patrick	...Sam!
Patrick	Wow, you pack a wallop, sis. Sam, this is my best friend SpongeBob.
Patrick	Hey great idea! I'll just go and get some tools and-
Patrick	Shame on you two! Look what you've done!
Patrick	That's the spirit, Sis.
Patrick	No I don't. Not even a teensie, eensie, teensie bit. I see now that you've turned against my sister, you've turned on your best friend as well!
Patrick	SpongeBob, why are you still saying mean things about Sam?
Patrick	Not the rock!
Patrick	Bye sis.
Patrick	Ow!
Patrick	Dumb rain! Doesn't anybody know I'm the sheriff in these parts? Hey, rain! You better stop that!
Patrick	Join us on the back nine?
Patrick	Moving my ball.
Patrick	Oh, it is just a game, which I am gonna win.
Patrick	Looks like we're tied, three shots to three.
Patrick	I have no idea what you're talking about.
Patrick	Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, hold on there, fella. It's not over yet.
Patrick	Oh!
Patrick	Don't worry, I'll get it.
Patrick	Uh-oh.
Patrick	Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hotter. Red hot! Red hot!  Wait, My mistake. You're right. Oh, Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hot. Red hot. Red hot! SpongeBob, red hot!  Wrong again.
Patrick	I was just freshening up. These fancy fixtures are touchy  Hot! Red hot! Ah! Cold! Cold!
Patrick	Play it where it lies.
Patrick	But I thought we weren't betting.
Patrick	Rain or shine, SpongeBob. Rain or shine.
Patrick	Found it! Thanks for the reminder, SpongeBob!  See ya again next spring.  Whatcha got in your trash can? Huh! You're throwing this away!!?? The wrapper of the gum I gave you yesterday!!??
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	Higher!
Patrick	When in doubt, pinky out.
Patrick	You're just being shy. Don't worry, buddy. You're doing fine.  I won't let you blow... this.  WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS?!  There's no water in here!
Patrick	Hi SpongeBob.
Patrick	Okay. Bye SpongeBob.  Oh!  Shoot, that was my last quarter.
Patrick	I hear ya. I hope I win so I can buy all the Krabby Patties I want! It will be the run of the heavy artillery: Gooey Worms!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Good idea.
Patrick	SpongeBob! Come on!  Let's get outta here!
Patrick	We gotta bust him out, quick! I'm gonna sit on him!
Patrick	Great, now we're stuck.
Patrick	Hahahaha!
Patrick	Hi, SpongeBob!
Patrick	AHHHHHHHHHH!
Patrick	I do?
Patrick	Show me! Show me! Oh please, please, please! Pretty please! Pretty please!
Patrick	New clothes?
Patrick	Oh, right!
Patrick	Why certainly.
Patrick	Boring!
Patrick	Let's shall!
Patrick	What?
Patrick	She's beautiful!
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	Okay.  Uhhh...
Patrick	SpongeBob, can I have a hall pass?
Patrick	All right, all right.
Patrick	You're gonna have things thrown at you that you wouldn't believe. You gotta be ready. Now try again.
Patrick	SpongeBob SquarePants, what a mess you've made of my classroom.
Patrick	Try again.
Patrick	Yeah, you do look pretty terrible.
Patrick	Go on, buddy.
Patrick	Wait, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Oh, that reminds me.  You forgot these.  Whoa-ho! Oh, they really work! Heh!
Patrick	Oh man. I'll never make art like you and...Squidward!
Patrick	Whoa. Slow down, SpongeBob.
Patrick	I shall make the attempt!  Privacy, please?
Patrick	I'm an artist!
Patrick	Is that good?
Patrick	So long, my trusted, yet untalented friend!  One for you! And one for you! And one for...  I've run out of rocks to put googly eyes on! I've run out of rocks!
Patrick	Uuuuuummmmm! Uhhhhhhhhh! I'm thinking about having a Krabby Patty.
Patrick	Maybe, I don't know! I'm in a creative slump!
Patrick	Oh, you can borrow mine!
Patrick	Of course, it's so obvious now! How did I not see it earlier? Squidward's a genius! I know now what I must do!
Patrick	Why is he so mad, Squidward? I was just following your advice!
Patrick	Mm, probably not. Needs more glitter.
Patrick	Hashbrowns!
Patrick	Please, no interruptions.
Patrick	That's it! I need a vacation.
Patrick	Wh-what's that?
Patrick	Who?...What?...Why?
Patrick	Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Patrick	I know a guy who knows a guy who went to the doctor once, and the doctor's office is a horrible, horrible place!
Patrick	Yes! It's a device so sinister, so icy cold when it touches your bare flesh, it...  Ssssss!
Patrick	Help, I'm shrinking!  No! Please don't hurt me!
Patrick	Sure, patient SpongeBob.  Hello, Sandy?
Patrick	Oh yeah, yeah, the rabbit. Don't bother, Sandy!  Oh, SpongeBob, quick, Sandy's coming! We've got to make sure you're well, or she'll take you to the doctor!  Don't touch me, I'm sterile! Scalpel, please.  Feeling better?
Patrick	Feeling better?
Patrick	Uh-oh, it's Sandy.  There's no one home.
Patrick	This is my mobile home.
Patrick	What do you mean? He's fine.
Patrick	I'll save you!
Patrick	SpongeBob?
Patrick	Yeah, it really calms my inner demons.
Patrick	It's probably just one of those fake haunted houses, you know, for babies.
Patrick	A little to the left.  A little help?
Patrick	Oh, come on, don't be such a baby!  Wow, so lame!
Patrick	Did you say something, SpongeBob?
Patrick	I think it's coming from that guy!
Patrick	Sing us a song, robot!
Patrick	Nope!
Patrick	Where's my pizza? What kind of pizza joint are you running anyhow?
Patrick	Houseboat full of ghosts!
Patrick	Think?
Patrick	Well, I thought mine seemed a little flat.
Patrick	Wow. This void sure is relaxing!  Hey! I've got a doughnut on my head! Come here, you.  Hey! Get back here!  Why is this happening to me?
Patrick	No, chocolate! No, a bagel! No-no-no-no, pancakes! No-no-no...
Patrick	Let's do this!
Patrick	Check.
Patrick	Thanks for nothing, Squidward.
Patrick	...Yeah, so?
Patrick	This is gonna be so super awesome!
Patrick	Are you going off the grid?
Patrick	What's that?
Patrick	You can't get to my stomach now, white coral ball.
Patrick	Hmmm... I wonder what we should do first.  You need to work on your handwriting, SpongeBob. I don't need this anyway.  Oh! I know! Let's go for a walk!
Patrick	Oh, hey, friend! What's up?
Patrick	He's safe with me.
Patrick	Whew! SpongeBob was right. You need a bath!  Oh! I almost forgot.  Snail food!
Patrick	All right.
Patrick	Well, make up your mind! Is it water or fire?  Okay, Gary. If you don't come to the bath, then the bath's gonna come to you.  That's a good boy! Now, suds up!
Patrick	SquareyPants' house.
Patrick	"""Snail Tales""? I thought it was called, ""Meow, meow, meow."""
Patrick	Pretty please?
Patrick	Hooray!
Patrick	Um...Tasting it.
Patrick	Not do anything.
Patrick	It wasn't me!
Patrick	Did you bring back any souvenirs?
Patrick	Hooray!
Patrick	"Two words, SpongeBob ""na"" ""chos."""
Patrick	I would like two extra cheesy nachos with a side of cheese and two vanilla coral shakes.  Actually, make that two cheese coral shakes. And instead of whipped cream on top, I'll take cream cheese on the bottom. That's it for now.
Patrick	My turn.
Patrick	I wonder if hot sauce is bad for our eyes.
Patrick	Why don't you just breathe water like a smart person?  Guess you're just too dumb.
Patrick	She's totally losing it.
Patrick	Get what over with?
Patrick	Hurry up, SpongeBob. I'm no doctor, but I don't think squirrels are suppose to be blue.
Patrick	But how are you going to get up there?
Patrick	Hey, who did that? Hey! Oh! Ghosts!
Patrick	SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?
Patrick	There you are.  Happy Valentine's Day! Here's your present.
Patrick	Is it ready now?
Patrick	Oh, come on, please!
Patrick	You got me a carnival? Mine! All mine, mine, mine, mine.  Mine, mine, mine! All right, everybody out! This is my carnival!
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	This tent?
Patrick	Heh, you're a sly one. I can't find here in the carnival...because it's on top of Mount 'Climb Up and Fall Off'.  It wasn't there either!
Patrick	No...no...eh-gee! Holy mackerel! Is it hot up here or what!
Patrick	I've been thinking. At first a handshake doesn't seem like much, but really it's the thought that counts
Patrick	So as I was saying...
Patrick	Heart on stick must die!  Heart on stick must die!
Patrick	You broke my heart! Now I'm gonna break something of yours!
Patrick	Uh-uh.
Patrick	Nuh-uh. I'm gonna say this once and I'm not going to say it again, so pay attention. I am not, I repeat, not going to turn around for any reason...ever!
Patrick	Aw SpongeBob, you didn't have to get me anything.
Patrick	Notice anything...  Different? Huh? Huh? A hint!
Patrick	Pretty please?
Patrick	I mopped the floors! I shined the mirrors! I scrubbed the sinks.
Patrick	You're the prettiest button I've ever... Huh? Monster!
Patrick	Sorry, button.
Patrick	Do you mind? Some of us have nothing to do tomorrow morning!
Patrick	X-rays tickle.
Patrick	Mmm! Freaky Clone Jelly Relish!
Patrick	Put him through.
Patrick	Sandy, don't hang up!
Patrick	Oh, SpongeBob's pineapple is rotting and falling apart all around us... we're doomed.
Patrick	Wrong! A pineapple needs a sweet, but tangy flavor.
Patrick	I'm starving.
Patrick	Okay. Once upon a time there was a sleepy little boy.
Patrick	"It's called ""The Land of Perpetual Excitement"" You know, It's a ""get out of bed"" story."
Patrick	Get up be active! Get up be active! Get up don't lie down! Get up don't lie down!
Patrick	Well, what, what, well, I don't know what you want from me, it's not like I have some magic wand to wave.  Or do I...
Patrick	SpongeBob, I see you're serious about this now. I didn't want to do this, but I'm gonna let you in on a little family secret. Old grandma suffered from severe toe barnacles.
Patrick	Coffee.
Patrick	Thanks for having lunch with me, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Funny faces make me laugh!
Patrick	Huh, fine. You?
Patrick	Gosh, you're right.
Patrick	Phee!
Patrick	Aydh!
Patrick	Gloriously disgusting, sir.
Patrick	: Hey SpongeBob!
Patrick	All right! We did it!
Patrick	I can't come out. SpongeBob I'm taking a shower.
Patrick	Close Glove World!?! Has the world gone mad?!
Patrick	A penny saved is a penny gloved!
Patrick	For all time's right sake.
Patrick	So many fun memories on this ride.
Patrick	Beats me. Let's go ride the Ferris Wheel.
Patrick	Then you mean...
Patrick	I uh, oh if you say so.
Patrick	We've come this far why start now?
Patrick	I know what we can do. Let's take a trip to Glove World! and cheers us up.
Patrick	I think so. Yeah i'm here.
Patrick	Mr.Owner Mr.Owner! Can I wear the glovey glove costume? Please, please? I just wanna try it on. And also this hat you let me earlier is turning to get little worn out. See?
Patrick	I thought he gave it to me.
Patrick	Yeah, it's the sound of total silence.  Plus tumbleweeds.
Patrick	You bet!
Patrick	At the bottom of Glove Lake. Where no one will eeeeeeeeeveeerr find it!  SpongeBob?
Patrick	Hey, a cookie!
Patrick	Gotcha!
Patrick	Cough him up, you monster! Come here, you!  Die, giant patty, die! Patties should not eat my buddy!
Patrick	Well, this will never do! You gotta think bigger! Everyone should know about the... uh... Krusty Krab. We need an ad blitz of monumental proportions! Everywhere you look, you should see the name..the Krabby Klam.
Patrick	Hold on to your shorts! I got it!
Patrick	Somehow, I thought that would be more effective.
Patrick	Huh! Oh, it's SpongeBob!  Hey, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Well, we're not playing! We're working!
Patrick	Based on a real treasure map.
Patrick	But I don't even work here!
Patrick	I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...!  land...
Patrick	This one, sir.
Patrick	I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks.
Patrick	Yeah...
Patrick	SpongeBob?
Patrick	I think that.
Patrick	Somebody left this thing laying around the parking lot.
Patrick	Hey thanks again fellas! Nice guys like them don't come around much these days. They even redecorated the tour busmobile for us!
Patrick	Wow...you're good at guessing...
Patrick	Um, could you give me a hand?
Patrick	Wow!
Patrick	Did you see that?
Patrick	Extreme!  Hey, who's holding the other end?
Patrick	Exercise?!  Eww, I didn't sign up for this!
Patrick	Dumpster diving!
Patrick	Hey, where are the Drasticals?  Here they come!
Patrick	What the...? Oh hey, it's Solitaire! I love this game! I take a touchdown!
Patrick	Uhhh...  Sand.
Patrick	Fear not, Patrick-Man is here.
Patrick	Shush SpongeBob! My identity must be kept secret! My work here is done. Patrick-Man is off! The city needs my help!  Oh, I almost forgot, can I get a Krabby Patty?
Patrick	Halt! Patrick-Man is on to you! Thief! Stealing is bad! Bad!
Patrick	Let's see you try to bust outta that, boat thief!
Patrick	Something a non-hero civilian would never understand.  I'm about to unmask one of Bikini Bottom's biggest foes! Right here in the Krusty Krab. And I've intercepted his evil schemes!
Patrick	Oh, right.  Gotcha!
Patrick	Protecting Bikini Bottom from a scoundrel!
Patrick	SpongeBob, you're looking at a superhero. So naturally, I will rely on my superpowers,  and throw some stuff!
Patrick	Lunch!
Patrick	What's this?
Patrick	They're on aisle 3, next to the most delicious snail treats. Follow me!Here they are! Tasty Time snail treats.
Patrick	I love this thing! Let's turn it up!Huh?Where did it go?
Patrick	Yeah. it makes me feel baby-ish. Oh, Look at me I'm a baby.
Patrick	Hey little Squidward. Ready to have some fun.
Patrick	He does.
Patrick	Taking care of a baby sure is hard
Patrick	Show me what you got at Glove World!!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob?
Patrick	What's wrong SpongeBob?
Patrick	I still can't read the signs. I wanna go home.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob...
Patrick	Oh.  Hey, you're floating too! What happened?
Patrick	Sorry!
Patrick	No, not really. I drifted off.
Patrick	Yeah, these goo bubbles won't bounce themselves.
Patrick	Oh, I want to play the drum!
Patrick	Oh, they shine!
Patrick	Help!
Patrick	Hey again, SpongeBlob!
Patrick	Really?  Do I need deodorant?
Patrick	What?! SpongeBob SquarePants, we have been friends for a long time, and you've asked me to do some crazy things over the years. Breaking into a bank?  Has to be the coolest!
Patrick	It's as close as I'll ever get to having shoes.
Patrick	This lock won't know what hit it!
Patrick	And he'll fry them into fish sticks! I can't watch! Is the scary part over?
Patrick	No problem.
Patrick	But that's when the Fisherman comes out!
Patrick	Wait a second. Y-You mean, I gotta walk all the way home alone?
Patrick	Thanks, Squidwar...
Patrick	Uh, someone's here?
Patrick	Not our bestest buddy! We gotta save him! Okay, with 33. I need you to go long. You're going down, Fisherman!
Patrick	Then can we eat some furniture?
Patrick	That good enough for ya?
Patrick	No.
Patrick	Oh, that's okay. See you, SpongeBob!
Patrick	Maybe it's just a squirrel thing..
Patrick	Well, let's get some Texas and bring it down here!
Patrick	Yeah. What's so great about dumb ol' Texas?
Patrick	I'm Texas too! Get a dog little longie! Get a dog!
Patrick	What's the difference?!
Patrick	SpongeBob!
Patrick	Should I start running now?
Patrick	Free French fries?
Patrick	"I can't think of any more food that starts with the letter ""c"", SpongeBob."
Patrick	"Oh!  Hey, buddy! Are you ready? Ready for your first day of glorious unemployment? Or as I like to call it, ""fun-employment""!"
Patrick	Hey, you're good at this. Next on our i-tin-er-ary, a brief mid-morning siesta.
Patrick	Free lunch with friends!
Patrick	Hey! You can't talk to my friend like that!
Patrick	There's always a shortcut!
Patrick	:  Yes!
Patrick	:  These guys talk funny words.
Patrick	: Oh, wow! I'll take seven!
Patrick	: Will the tie let me order the executive treatment?
Patrick	: Thanks! I'll take one executive treatment my good man.
Patrick	: No!  No!!!  No!!!  Not 4-B!!! NO!!!!!
Patrick	:  Where am I?
Patrick	: What if I had a meaningless chart?
Patrick	:Oh.
Patrick	: You do?
Patrick	: Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	: Oh, wait! Oh, is that what I think it is?!
Patrick	Huh. Well, what about those baby snails?
Patrick	My mouth is warm.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob! This guy found this snail in his garden and he didn't know what to do. So, I told him how you take care of snails.
Patrick	Meow.
Patrick	Meow, help! Meow, help!
Patrick	I isn't Patrick?
Patrick	I like to eat!
Patrick	Gotta warm up my taste buds first.
Patrick	I don't
Patrick	Hey.
Patrick	What's that?
Patrick	It's over SpongeBob, I can't go on.
Patrick	I don't get it! What's an audit?
Patrick	I don't think this game is ripe.
Patrick	Then I could make a game?
Patrick	"Well, you know how hard ""Tic-Tac-Toe"" is and how it always takes so long to play?"
Patrick	"Oh, yeah! An O! And the first person to get two in a row draws a line through them and says, ""Tic-Tac""!.  You start!"
Patrick	"Squidward, I got a new game! It's called ""Rock, Paper, Butter""!"
Patrick	I know what to do!
Patrick	Good evening. Please step into my gamatourium.
Patrick	It's called... Patrick! The Game!
Patrick	Ok! Now, onto rules of how to play the game.
Patrick	You go to jail.
Patrick	You have to roll a six.
Patrick	"Oh boy! You landed on ""Do a Surgery""!  Now, pick a surgery card."
Patrick	Wait, how'd he get out of jail?
Patrick	Starving! Starving sea star time!
Patrick	"Not so fast!  No player may declare himself ""Automatic Winner."""
Patrick	Ooh! I could use a mint! Mmm!
Patrick	Oh, yes. Please.
Patrick	Pretty please? Pretty please? Pretty please?
Patrick	Oh! It's like a dream!
Patrick	I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge.
Patrick	I'm in charge.
Patrick	Uh. Huh? What?
Patrick	Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotcha.
Patrick	Um. Uh. Your.. your bowl is bigger!
Patrick	Well, I wanna trade back!
Patrick	I'll take those my good man.
Patrick	Who's in charge?
Patrick	Oh, that's a pity.
Patrick	Hey!
Patrick	No, you open it!
Patrick	I blame science! Stupid science!
Patrick	I declare a thumb war!
Patrick	Gee, thanks, SpongeBob. That means a lot.
Patrick	Uhhhhhh, turn over.
Patrick	Ungaw!
Patrick	It's okay, I hate work anyway.
Patrick	Life is but a walking shadow. Ha-lube-lube-lube-lube-lube... []
Patrick	Sold? Where am I gonna live now?
Patrick	He shows up on television, and buys your home and there's nothing you can do about it.  Now I am doomed to walk the seas without a home.
Patrick	Hi, Squidward!
Patrick	Really weird!
Patrick	Cause my house is a rock?
Patrick	I missed my house, and I was hoping I could move back in.
Patrick	Prove it!
Patrick	They need a band. I'll go talk to the guys that live in my old place, and see if they can come over to play along!
Patrick	I know!
Patrick	Digging.
Patrick	I don't know, but it must have been pretty good to make him cry like that.
Patrick	It's harder to walk, but worth it.
Patrick	With real rocks!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, now that I'm finished doing whatever it is I'm doing, you wanna go play?
Patrick	Oh, I don't know.
Patrick	Oh, now I gotta start over! Ooh, someone fix that broken robot.
Patrick	What am I doing again?
Patrick	That's it. I can't take it anymore. Everybody out!
Patrick	SpongeBob, what?
Patrick	I missed you too.
Patrick	But I have to speak at a shareholders meeting tonight. How am I gonna say nice things about frozen patties now that I know they're filled with sand?
Patrick	...Made with sand!
Patrick	Watch this.
Patrick	Okay. Hmm.
Patrick	Can I have some more?  It's hard to eat off this side of me.
Patrick	I want more Nutty Butter.
Patrick	"Uh. Well, it's like Sandy said, ""Something, something, something, science."" And who are we to argue with science?"
Patrick	Don't worry. I made more Nutty Butter with the rest of the nuts.
Patrick	Hey, that's me!
Patrick	What's wrong?
Patrick	You were Fry-Banshee?!
Patrick	No, I'm not.
Patrick	What a ride!
Patrick	Oh ho! Yes! Yes!
Patrick	Hey!
Patrick	100%.
Patrick	I can't believe you thought I would eat it!
Patrick	Oh boy!
Patrick	The Krabby Patty won! It won!
Patrick	Dying? Oh, oh! You didn't read the whole letter!
Patrick	Watch out!
Patrick	Fly first class, check!
Patrick	I am!
Patrick	Thanks for helping me finish my list, SpongeBob.
Patrick	I don't understand the question.
Patrick	Oww!
Patrick	Well, now that my all over hurts, I'm not thinking about my mouth.  Ow! I guess that didn't work!
Patrick	Slow down, SpongeBob! This place is scary enough without you going crazy with the beads!
Patrick	That's not right!
Patrick	Tooth Island?
Patrick	Oops.
Patrick	Ow!
Patrick	That's okay, SpongeBob. I think I can manage.
Patrick	Not wanted. That fixes it.
Patrick	What's that?
Patrick	I'm ready, Doc. Do what you have to do.
Patrick	SpongeBob?
Patrick	There really is a Tooth Ferry!
Patrick	Hey SpongeBob, look what it says here.  Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease but all have failed.
Patrick	Hold on, almost there.
Patrick	Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any...  Ouch.
Patrick	He'll settle for one.
Patrick	Hey, that sounds pretty good.
Patrick	Good morning, Krusty Krew.
Patrick	Two sticks?! That's against the rules! You can't change the rules, SpongeBob, just because I'm winning!
Patrick	I want it! I want it!
Patrick	Boo!
Patrick	Well, maybe he fell in the toilet. I'll check!
Patrick	She spit in his face!
Patrick	Only the dismal abyss of black nothingness.
Patrick	Here, brains!
Patrick	I'll take it!
Patrick	Okay. SANDY!
Patrick	You're right!
Patrick	Yeah. You'd better do something or whatever.
Patrick	I heard him say something negative!
Patrick	Yeah. Not bad. But next time, we won't go so easy on ya!
Patrick	"Sounds good to me, ""me."""
Patrick	Why?!
Patrick	Mmm! Mmm!
Patrick	Ah! It's a monster with SpongeBob's voice!
Patrick	Tell my parents I love them.
Patrick	Oh, yeah. I should probably...
Patrick	Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie!  Wake up, little Squidward, wake up!
Patrick	Ooh, we've tried everything under the ocean and we failed! If only we could just crawl up inside Squidward and play him like a puppet.
Patrick	Okay.
Patrick	Wow, you sound more like him thanthan Squidward!
Patrick	I guess I never actually thought of the moment where we'd have to play it.
Patrick	Hey, kids, I'm a
Patrick	They tore off my head.
Patrick	I love delicious stuff. My turn!
Patrick	Mine, mine!
Patrick	Oh. Thanks!
Patrick	Ahh!
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob? Do you think this is working?
Patrick	This contract tastes legitimate, but I don't believe it!
Patrick	Ooh!
Patrick	My turn!  I'm losing my footing!  Oof! I've survived a deadly fall unhurt!
Patrick	Sting me, sting me, sting me!
Patrick	Actually, you better take two, since you kind of a klutz.
Patrick	Yes!
Patrick	It's not?
Patrick	Catch!
Patrick	Sounds reasonable.  Uh, I'm going to need to borrow a quarter.
Patrick	Oooh.  Ah!
Patrick	Squid is number one!
Patrick	Guess what? The carnivals in town. Come on, let's go.
Patrick	Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese!
Patrick	Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel...
Patrick	Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey?
Patrick	Ready.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way.
Patrick	Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us.
Patrick	Hello? Does somebody have a can opener?
Patrick	Ahhh! Best day ever!
Patrick	Brain freeze! I can't eat it all! Ah, I've never been more disappointed in myself.
Patrick	Ow! Okay, SpongeBob, you ruined everything.
Patrick	Poke. Poke.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob! What's up?
Patrick	Now what, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Uh, actually... I have a confession to make.  I don't know how to tie my shoelaces.
Patrick	Are you sure you know how to do it?
Patrick	No.
Patrick	Oh, hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Come again, sir!
Patrick	No, this is Patrick.
Patrick	Uhh...
Patrick	Uhh...  Okay! I've got it.
Patrick	Aaaah! Let us out!
Patrick	Ahh!
Patrick	Yes, I am.
Patrick	Well, maybe it's just because you're ugly.
Patrick	SpongeBob, can I borrow some bath beads?  SpongeBob?
Patrick	Just do what I do when I have problems.  Scream!  Come on buddy I'll help you.  Okay now, say it.  Say it.
Patrick	You're ugly and what...?
Patrick	Louder.
Patrick	People respect self esteem.
Patrick	You look at it!
Patrick	That looks great!  Oh, I gotta go to the restroom!  I'm out of soap, can I borrow-
Patrick	Oh... Oh! I caught the ugly!
Patrick	That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people. Now look at me!  I'm almost as ugly as you! I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do.
Patrick	Ahhhhhhhh, what a relief...
Patrick	Well, I had some of your sundae.
Patrick	Yes?
Patrick	Tsk, tsk, tsk.  Apply the sauce.  I... Will not... Be separated... From... This... surfboard!  Rock! Separate, separate!
Patrick	I feel so floaty! Hey, why are we, huh?
Patrick	An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award.  Jellyfish, I got an award.  Island, I got an awar...  I gotta show SpongeBob.
Patrick	SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name.
Patrick	I can find it. Is it in here?
Patrick	That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.
Patrick	Doctor?
Patrick	Then let's go.
Patrick	Tartar sauce.
Patrick	Like that?
Patrick	No, this is Patrick.
Patrick	Huh? Oh, Fishpaste!
Patrick	I'm never going to get an award, now.
Patrick	Exactly as you do. Oh, no, I broke it!
Patrick	Then I took the lid off and I thought I broke it.
Patrick	Yup. If I'm gonna be an award winner, I've gotta dress like one.
Patrick	Uhh, me, too.  Ow!
Patrick	Stop it.
Patrick	There's no award for that.
Patrick	Me, too.
Patrick	My turn!
Patrick	Oh, great!  What's it for this time?
Patrick	Is that really the  origin of King Neptune?
Patrick	I think I might need that.
Patrick	GO! GO! GO!
Patrick	What?
Patrick	"Bikini Bottom Legends. It's a chapter called ""Things to do when encountering a legendary creature"". It says to be polite.  Offer a gift, oh."
Patrick	SpongeBob, went to get more giant paper. Uhhhh...Patrick. P.S. Happy Leif Ericcson Day! Yingin-hinga- dinga!
Patrick	I think he means you, SpongeBob.
Patrick	I can try.
Patrick	That they taste nice!
Patrick	Yay!
Patrick	I also have a name!
Patrick	Hey, that was mine!
Patrick	I don't get it.
Patrick	We stayed out in the sun so long, that I turned pink!
Patrick	It's-
Patrick	You can't tell from the picture, but that whole mountain is made of sugar.
Patrick	This Halloween, I'm gonna dress up like Patrick.
Patrick	How do you make a ball out of feet?
Patrick	Well, where's Patrick? What have you done with me?!
Patrick	...SpongeBob, they're spitting into my mouth! Ugh, this is probably how landlions feed their young.
Patrick	Uh, I don't know.
Patrick	You know what's weird? When I was taking my siesta, I dreamed you were at this building.
Patrick	It is what's inside that counts.
Patrick	I would make a bad ballet dancer because I can't stand on my toes.
Patrick	She's a beauty. She is... trs belle!
Patrick	I'd never been on top of the water before! I got sea star sick.
Patrick	I am?
Patrick	I'm pretty sure it is.
Patrick	False advertising.
Patrick	I like to boogie!
Patrick	He was nice!
Patrick	Right! It's me!  It's my birthday! And it is happy!
Patrick	SpongeBob, that just means they're hungry. Come on!
Patrick	If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere!
Patrick	My favorite ride was the Devil's Drop!
Patrick	Pet-sitting? Won't that hurt them?
Patrick	You found me!
Patrick	Me too!  And then we're gonna play tag and then we're gonna color and then we're gonna build a house of cards!
Patrick	What is that thing?
Patrick	I am?
Patrick	Tartar sauce.
Patrick	He's gonna eat Squidward and Mr. Krabs!
Patrick	Pretty scary, huh?
Patrick	Gotcha.
Patrick	About the what?
Patrick	You'll find the answer in your heart. Or, is it butt?
Patrick	The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.
Patrick	You don't mean...?
Patrick	Let's hear it for SpongeBob! Hello? Where'd everybody go? Did I miss something? Did you see my butt?
Patrick	[] What?! That's insane!
Patrick	Are you sure?
Patrick	Now you're talking. Hey, waiter, we need another one over here.
Patrick	7!
Patrick	You're hot.
Patrick	What is it?
Patrick	Are they laughing at us?
Patrick	Going on.
Patrick	Are we there yet?
Patrick	Where do you think it is?
Patrick	Ooh! Ooh! Wait!, I wanna do the distraction!
Patrick	Whoa.
Patrick	Guess what I got.
Patrick	I'm getting two today. One for me, and one for my friend.
Patrick	Sir, yes, sir!  Locked and loading!
Patrick	Finland.
Patrick	Uhh... I just remembered! I don't work for Mr. Krabs.
Patrick	No Krabby Patties?  NOOOO!!
Patrick	I...need...Krabby Patties!  Vandalizing stuff.
Patrick	Correct! It  you! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob.
Patrick	A team? Oh, oh, pick me, pick me, pick me!
Patrick	What? Huh? Who goes there?
Patrick	Uhh... Squidward?
Patrick	I bring a message from the dawn of time!
Patrick	Well, it's not fair. You have feet. Sandy has feet. Squidward has feet.
Patrick	Maybe this guy knows where we are. He looks smart. He's got five heads.
Patrick	Oh, hey Squidward.
Patrick	I wanna be on a new team. This one's broken.
Patrick	Oh, yeah, sorry!
Patrick	Me too.  Inflatable pants! What's your idea?
Patrick	SpongeBob, sometimes we have to go deep inside ourselves to solve our problems.
Patrick	Huh?
Patrick	Don't touch me, I'm sterile!
Patrick	I'm sorry that happened to you, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Have I ever not been right?  You're a man now, SpongeBob, and it's time you starting acting like one.
Patrick	No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
Patrick	Tell her like it is, SpongeBob, no more baby stuff.
Patrick	All right!  Rewards, huh?
Patrick	D'oh! My wittle finger!
Patrick	EEEEEEEEE...
Patrick	Hey, you got the same reef blower as me!  Tag, you're it.
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	Can I get a large #1, extra size?
Patrick	Are you Squidward now?
Patrick	Who are you people?!
Patrick	But I don't work here!
Patrick	I know what I want to do today!  I need some money.  Uh.  Oh.  Oh...   I don't have any money.  SpongeBob, I want a balloon really, really badly!  Really, really badly!
Patrick	Right!
Patrick	And the moon and the sky and under a car, behind the dumpster!
Patrick	And with a whale!
Patrick	Ga-heh!
Patrick	Confess?!  Are you out of your mind?! Do you have any idea what they do to people like us? We're not talking about some dumb mail fraud scheme or a hijacking here.   We stole a Balloon!   And they're going to lock us up forever.
Patrick	Goodbye, Bikini Bottom.
Patrick	Hey, if we're underwater, how could there be a...
Patrick	Oh!
Patrick	And the bitter cold, it's bracing, isn't it?!
Patrick	Uh, let me try:  Uh...hey, punk.
Patrick	You, too!  I wish we had something to eat, though.
Patrick	Thanks SpongeBob. I think I'll eat it now!  I think I'll eat it now.  Ow! Who?  Where'd my candy bar go?  I must have dropped it.
Patrick	You stole my candy bar!
Patrick	Yours? You mean mine.
Patrick	Well, you would know... liar.
Patrick	Stop it!
Patrick	Oh,  that's it!
Patrick	No, you are!
Patrick	All right! Which one of you flatfoots stole my lollipop?  I mean it.
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	Yippee! A writing stick.
Patrick	Santa! Haha. Where's Santa?
Patrick	A star on top will complete all the scenery!
Patrick	Wow.  A wrist watch.
Patrick	We better put these on.
Patrick	It's a vast, swirling wonderland of sparkling white pleasure. Let it fill your senses with cascading, fluffy pillows of excitement and comfort as you've never felt before.
Patrick	Take it off. No one's looking.  SpongeBob, did you hear that?
Patrick	Hibernation must mean the opposite of beauty sleep.
Patrick	That's not disturbing.  is disturbing!  Hi there, SpongeBob. My name is Patback.
Patrick	Please, Sandy, I can't afford dry cleaning!
Patrick	Hey Sandy, does it work?
Patrick	Nice paneling.
Patrick	I say I'm Dirty Dan!
Patrick	I'm Dirty Dan.
Patrick	I'm Dirty Dan.  Screaming will get you no-
Patrick	Did you win?  Hi, SpongeBob!  Okay, SpongeBob, you can be Dirty Dan. I just wanna be Patrick!
Patrick	Barnacles.  Is it spring yet?
Patrick	Maybe she just ignores it.
Patrick	Come on, do it! I'm freezing here!
Patrick	No, I'm warm.
Patrick	Hi SpongeBob, what are you doing?
Patrick	It tickles!
Patrick	Well, I don't mind SpongeBob. In fact, why don't you Gary stay over at my house tonight?
Patrick	Blah blah blah blah blah
Patrick	Come on Gary, let's play a different game.
Patrick	Well, well, well I guess that answers that question.  So long, SpongeBob. Me and Gary got stuff to do.
Patrick	And uh, SpongeBob, could we borrow some soap?
Patrick	I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But Gary's with me now. You had your chance and you failed. You have to stop living in the past. Face it SpongeBob, you're only hurting yourself.  It's what Gary wants, and what Gary wants is me! Right, Gary?  He only liked me for my shorts!
Patrick	Maybe he doesn't like us.
Patrick	Merry Christmas!
Patrick	Firmly grasp it in your hand.  Firmly grasp it.  Firmly grasp it!  That oughta do it.
Patrick	Yeah, you got it Squidward! Yeah, you're doing it Squidward! See who'd you been missing?
Patrick	It's in the bag!
Patrick	There's always tomorrow!
Patrick	Jellyfish are awesome!
Patrick	Touch.
Patrick	SpongeBob, as a friend, I must say that's really geeky.  Oh my gosh! Jeffrey Jellyfish! Wait, Jeffrey! I have to touch you!
Patrick	...and BoyPatrick
Patrick	Huh? MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA...
Patrick	FRUH-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRO!
Patrick	Oh, I love that episode.
Patrick	Return what to who?
Patrick	That makes sense to me.
Patrick	Oops. Gotta start again.
Patrick	No! SpongeBob, tickle him!
Patrick	Let go of it, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Well, that's good enough for me. I guess he's reconstituted.
Patrick	Good, I thought it was my skin.
Patrick	Well, this is an invisible boat, right? So, you need an invisible license.
Patrick	Whoo-hoo!
Patrick	SpongeBob, five minutes.  Hel-lo... Sandy. Me Patrick. Do you un-der-stand?  Squirrels.
Patrick	She says land creatures are best.
Patrick	Sandy's a girl?
Patrick	Hey! We are not chicken!  Huh! My popcorn!
Patrick	I may keep a second rock up here.
Patrick	Well, I'm outta here. Thanks for nothin', SpongeBob.
Patrick	No way! Only a jerk would upset a gentle giant. Right, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Hey, let's investigate this crime and catch the lowlife who's responsible!
Patrick	Oh, hi, SpongeBob. I'm just continuing my investigation of the great Clamu Caper!
Patrick	This is it! All of the clues are coming together. I followed these footprints right to this exact spot and then, right where you're standing, I found this bag of peanuts! Ha! Oh, I'm so close to solving this crime, I can almost taste it.  Boy, crime fighting sure makes me hungry, and this yellow popsicle hits the spot!
Patrick	Dum, dum, dum dum, de, dum...
Patrick	How about...
Patrick	SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
Patrick	Probably.
Patrick	And I got this hat!
Patrick	Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
Patrick	How does he do that?
Patrick	Wait, I have an idea!
Patrick	Yeah.
Patrick	Three. Take it or leave it.
Patrick	Uhh...
Patrick	Uhh...  Okay! I've got it.
Patrick	Aaaah! Let us out!
Patrick	You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!
Patrick	Go touch it.
Patrick	Pretty good, SpongeBob! But it's lacking basic construction, and your perspective leaves a lot to be desired.
Patrick	Your art can never hang in a museum.
Patrick	My turn!
Patrick	You're right, SpongeBob.
Patrick	He's beating up Squidward!
Patrick	I'm not going in there
Patrick	Where's the leak, ma'am?  Yurrgh!
Patrick	Oh... but it looks good on you, SpongeBob! Heh heh.
Patrick	Here's your present.  You're welcome.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?
Patrick	He still looks kind of creepy.
Patrick	First, I have to put away my secret box.
Patrick	Like what?
Patrick	WOW! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh.  Tell me some more secrets!
Patrick	Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret.  Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am it's sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the secret of the box.  Nobody! Not even Squidward's house.  It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna  SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box! Now, hand it over!
Patrick	Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever?  The most amazing...  mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom.
Patrick	Duh... who's there?
Patrick	It's the Clam Burglar! And he's stealing my secret box!  Hand over the goods, Secret Box Bandit, and prepare for the most unpleasant pillow fight of your life!
Patrick	That's it, SpongeBob! You have crossed the line. As of right now, this friendship is OVER!!!
Patrick	A secret string!
Patrick	Is mayonnaise an instrument?
Patrick	You're welcome.
Patrick	Come on, SpongeBob!
Patrick	SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay.
Patrick	NEED... FURNITURE!
Patrick	I don't know what to do, SpongeBob. You gotta to help me!
Patrick	Yeah, but turn it over, there's a letter!
Patrick	That always cheers me up.  But not today.
Patrick	Math is power!
Patrick	Why wouldn't I recognize my own parents?
Patrick	Hooray, the idiot's here! I mean, I'll get it!
Patrick	"He means ""shake"".  No, SpongeBob, no! Shake hands!  No, SpongeBob! Grab my dad's hand.  Grab it with only one hand!  Good boy! Now move your arm up and down!"
Patrick	Only on Wednesday.
Patrick	Aw, he said my name.
Patrick	Oh, were those too complicated for you? I'll try dumb-ing them down a bit.
Patrick	And don't worry, I'll keep this warm for ya!
Patrick	Janet? Marty? Who are you people?!
Patrick	"""Krabs..."" Uh, isn't that the red sweaty guy you work for?"
Patrick	Why, yes it is, SpongeBob. This  day is particularly  lovely!
Patrick	Nice  day we're having, isn't it Squidward?
Patrick	Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing.
Patrick	My turn!  Hooray! Escalators! Yay!  Up, up, up!
Patrick	Eels...
Patrick	"But, you said """"!"
Patrick	Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!
Patrick	I'm sorry too, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Hey, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Be a fry cook? Is that all I gotta do? That'll be easy!
Patrick	Tssss...
Patrick	I cannot believe what I am hearing!
Patrick	I'm gonna get a job as a fry cook and it'll be easy!
Patrick	I've been working for the Chum Bucket for almost five minutes.
Patrick	He's not?
Patrick	Because you told me to!
Patrick	Forget the Chum Bucket. This is personal.
Patrick	I a thousand times never liked you!
Patrick	Yeah, pal. Let's go home.
Patrick	Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!
Patrick	Well, you're still yellow! And you know what else is yellow?
Patrick	I did?
Patrick	Clarinet? I love music!
Patrick	Hey, buddy. I warmed it up for ya.
Patrick	Where are ya, ol buddy?
Patrick	Can I have some now, buddy?
Patrick	Hey, Squidward!
Patrick	Hey, Squidward!
Patrick	Hey, Squidward!
Patrick	Me and SpongeBob are friends again!
Patrick	We should take Bikini Bottom, and push it somewhere else!
Patrick	PUSH!  Push!
Patrick	What?
Patrick	Oh, what do you want to be a lifeguard for? Nobody really likes those guys.  Being a lifeguard is so dumb. All they do is blow, blow, blow on their stupid whistles, rub, rub, rub that white stuff on their noses and show off their gross misshapen bodies!
Patrick	Help, help!  I can't swim!
Patrick	Can't swim! Butt hurts! Ice cream!
Patrick	Help, I'm drowning! I've got butt cramps! I want ice cream and now its dark!  Help, help! Help me, I'm drowning! Help!
Patrick	And I still don't have my ice cream.
Patrick	Squidward, you and your nose will definitely not fit in!
Patrick	Ready!
Patrick	It's not?
Patrick	The shell has spoken!
Patrick	Hmm... Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
Patrick	It's spring!
Patrick	Yeah, hey Mario. Let me get a large double olive, double-
Patrick	Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I was just talking to my old community college buddy, Flats.  I bumped into him at the soda store, isn't that funny?  It must have been years since we've seen each other. Well, let me get going. He's got to go back to school soon. He says he's got to kick somebody's butt.  Hello? Is this Pizza Castle?
Patrick	I thought it wouldn't work.
Patrick	Let's play Mountain Climbing Adventure!
Patrick	Uh... check!
Patrick	I am the lizard king! Whoo!
Patrick	Hold me.
Patrick	Nooooo!
Patrick	That's easy. All you need is a box.
Patrick	Here I am!
Patrick	Beep-boop-bee-boop.
Patrick	Oh, well.
Patrick	A Squidward action figure!  Let me play with him!
Patrick	Oh...  and then comes a giant fist!
Patrick	Let me take a look at it. Hmmm. You know what the problem is?
Patrick	Well alright then. Let 'er rip!  It worked!
Patrick	You know what's funny? My pickle started out in a jar, and now it's in one again! Heh. It's like a pun or something. Heheh.
Patrick	Get out of bed.
Patrick	Patrick SquarePants!
Patrick	Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?
Patrick	No, no, get in the boat!  Give her the apple.
Patrick	Freeze, mister!  Big toe.
Patrick	Right.
Patrick	Well, it sounds like it's all your fault.
Patrick	Hi.
Patrick	Yeah.  This is serious, SpongeBob. Someone's after me. I think I better leave town.
Patrick	Thanks, buddy.
Patrick	Huh?  Ha! You missed me!
Patrick	I don't think I can make it! Please?
Patrick	PLEASE!
Patrick	Come on, SpongeBob, let's go knock each other's brains out!
Patrick	You said  were SpongeBob, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Then it's war!
Patrick	I think Squidward's taking this really seriously.  That last one had his clarinet in it.
Patrick	That looks like the toilet plunger I threw out yesterday.
Patrick	Patrick Star, you are one smart shopper.
Patrick	Oh, so it's Mega Weenie Monday?
Patrick	Hey, that's not a bad idea! You can call me a couple of bad names, we rumble, next thing you know, you're in the Salty Spitoon.
Patrick	Okay, but I must warn you. I happen to be a world championship... uhh...  ...kick boxer.
Patrick	I thought the Corps would help me straighten out my life, sir!
Patrick	I see you got the paper.
Patrick	Ah, but it is you  that is messing with me.  That's what's messing with us!
Patrick	Well, we can't just leave him out here.
Patrick	Let's try a donut.
Patrick	Do something, SpongeBob!
Patrick	I know, good thing there's two of us.
Patrick	It sure is cute when it's asleep.
Patrick	Well, good night, SpongeBob.
Patrick	Ahh! Wish I could, but I gotta get going.
Patrick	Phew, what a day.
Patrick	Oh yeah, your break. Uh, tomorrow, I promise.
Patrick	Tomorrow for sure.
Patrick	Just one more minute, I gotta...
Patrick	He's only this big.  How many diapers could he possibly use?
Patrick	I have no idea! What kind of a father am I?! Oh!  I'll make it up to you, buddy. I promise!
Patrick	Six o'clock.
Patrick	Oh, that was some party!  Oh, hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Junior. What? What?
Patrick	Oh wait, wait, let me guess. I give up.
Patrick	He got hit in the head with two coconuts!
Patrick	Yeah, overtime, pal!
Patrick	You just keep going on working and working!
Patrick	No.
Patrick	This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume.
Patrick	Yeah, SpongeBob?
Patrick	Good, just don't pay me.
Patrick	And mount them on the wall.  Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob!  CAREFUL, SPONGEBOB!!
Patrick	Can you move it along, I'm all out of time cards.
Patrick	Nonsense!
Patrick	Oh, now I see it!
Patrick	Nope.
Patrick	Oof! Oof! Oof!
Patrick	I don't see where you're going with this...hey, a dollar!
Patrick	Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Have mercy! Have mercy!
Patrick	Boo!
Patrick	Can I use mine one last time?
Patrick	We need 'em! We need 'em!
Patrick	Oh yeah, whoo! That's what I'm talking about. Oh, yeah! Yeah, the colors! whoo!
Patrick	Yes!
Patrick	Never never never never ever never ever never
Patrick	Cowabunga!
Patrick	Yay! Champion of the deep! Woo!
Patrick	Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, reunite!
Patrick	Dark knight?!
Patrick	Hooray!
Patrick	Whee!
Patrick	I'm waiting.
Patrick	Pizzazz, yeah.
Patrick	Yes, sir!
Patrick	Hup, hup, hup, hup.
Patrick	Oh.
Patrick	There it is!
Patrick	You planned this?
Patrick	I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
Patrick	Woo hoo!
Patrick	Squidward had a Krabby Patty--
Patrick	Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty!
Patrick	Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Patrick	Happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts...
Patrick	Let's do this!
Patrick	Good-bye!
Patrick	Runna-way Mermerang!
Patrick	Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite!
Patrick	Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick...
Patrick	It's Coming?  Oh, boy!It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!
Patrick	Aaahhhhhh!!!! . Aaahhhh!
Patrick	Whew!
Patrick	All right!
Patrick	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Patrick	Change us back! Change us back! We don't like being ghosts! I don't want to be a ghost!  Change us back! Change us back! Change us back! We don't like to be a lie again!
Patrick	Gagagaga!
Patrick	Yay!
Patrick	Yay!
Patrick	Please! Please, let us in!
Patrick	I'm it! I'm it! I'm it! I'm it! I'm it! I'm it! I'm it! I'm it!
Patrick	Sorry, Squidward.
Patrick	We are!
Patrick	Again!
Patrick	No!
Patrick	Oh, no!
Patrick	Nooooo!
Patrick	The grand What?
Patrick	Treasure?  We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!
Patrick	Captain Krabs?
Patrick	And one for all.
Patrick	Extreme what?
Patrick	Squidward!  Squidie. No!
Patrick	Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Sandy's surprise is at the Krusty Krab!
Patrick	Cameras?
Patrick	Thanks!
Patrick	Cool toilet!
Patrick	Eew!
Patrick	Whirly brains! Whirly brains! Whirly brains! Whirly brains! Whirly brains!
Patrick	What was that?
Patrick	By the power of Neptune, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy unite!
Patrick	Justice restored!
Patrick	Hmm...
Patrick	Yay! Life insurance!
Patrick	Wait, what's moxie?
Patrick	Wow!
Patrick	Squidward!
Patrick	...blastoff.
Patrick	Ahh! Mother of pearl. Fire on the poop deck.
Patrick	AAAAAAAAHHH!!!!
Patrick	Bye, Sandy!
Patrick	Goofy Goober's Ice Cream Party Boat!
Patrick	Okay!
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	It's shaping up to be a wonderful holiday. Not your normal, average, everyday.
Patrick	Even all the trash, on Christmas it smells so sweetly! This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas to me!
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	Up, up, and away!
Patrick	Let go!
Patrick	A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
Patrick	Bad word?!
Patrick	Mmm-mmm...!
Patrick	You  care!
Patrick	Squidward!
Patrick	Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Again! Oh, yeah! Again!
Patrick	To the club!
Patrick	Yeah!
Patrick	See you later then.
Patrick	Wow.
Patrick	See ya later, Squidward!
Patrick	Yay!
Patrick	It's the police!
Patrick	Hooray, we're spy buddies!  Spy buddies.
Patrick	...and explosive diarrhea.
Patrick	We did it!
Patrick	Deal.
Patrick	Raah!  Help! Help! Help!
Patrick	Ew!  He inked!
Patrick	We don't know.
Patrick	You're welcome!
Patrick	Jellyfishing make me feel all right!
Patrick	That was fun.
Patrick	Squidward! Squidward!  Squidward!  Squidward! Oh, Squidward!  Squidward!
Patrick	You are, Squidward!
Patrick	Ahh, whew.
Patrick	Ahhhhh...  ahh...  ah...
Patrick	Ugh!
Patrick	We sure are excited!
Patrick	Your welcome!
Patrick	We promise Mr. Krabs.
Patrick	Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah. You're a Goofy Goober, yeah. We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah. Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah!
Patrick	Help! Help us! We're drowning!
Patrick	SpongeBob! There you are!
Patrick	There you go.
Patrick	All right, let's go!
Patrick	You fools!
Patrick	Oh, okay-kay, come on now, don't be all scared. I'll walk you home.
Patrick	Yeah., goodnight! Just don't think about the Fisherman!
Patrick	The Fisherman!
Patrick	Hey. Good idea. Let's trade.  Here you go.
Patrick	What are you doing here?
Plankton	Eat my microscopic dust, Krabs! Your secret formula is finally mine!
Plankton	Can I have the secret formula?
Plankton	AH-HAH!
Plankton	Curse you,  Kra-a-aillllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Plankton	Leave me alone.
Plankton	Henchmen?
Plankton	That's okay. I'm no different than the millions of other Plankton in the sea.  The Plankton family has always been pushed around and stepped on. Wait! That's it! Acting alone, we're powerless, but united, the Plankton family could be a real pain in the fanny!  Krabs may think one Plankton is no problem, but let's see him take on two, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand!  But why stop there? I'll gather every family member from every corner of the ocean. The entire Plankton family under one roof! Krabs won't stand a chance against the staggering intellect of a million super-smart criminal masterminds!  They're here! Welcome, brethren!
Plankton	Alright! I get it! I mean, uh, come inside. Make yourself at home.  I'd like you to meet my computer wife, Karen.
Plankton	All right, as I was saying...  Okay, we all know Sheldon's a funny name.
Plankton	Help me get the secret formula and you can have as much root beer as you can drink!  Victory, thy name is Plankton!
Plankton	What army? What army?! Look around you, Krabs!
Plankton	Silence!  I think you'll find we're more than capable of figuring it out for ourselves. Oh, boys?  That's it, a little to the left...
Plankton	Begging won't help.
Plankton	...Three teaspoons of chopped onions...!
Plankton	Open 24 hours, eh? I knew he couldn't resist staying open later than me.  My evil plan is working perfectly. He'll run his employees into the ground, and when SpongeBob's mind finally cracks from exhaustion, I'll get him to tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula.  Why aren't you laughing?
Plankton	Eh...no.
Plankton	Let's start with a simple exercise.
Plankton	No, I mean ingredients. What are the stinking ingredients?
Plankton	Spatula.
Plankton	Potato
Plankton	Oh, o.k.  I'll be over here, then.
Plankton	Now, keep your eyes on this watch.  When I count to three, you will fall into a deep sleep. 1...uh, 2...uh, 3.  I can't believe it worked. Now, when I snap my fingers, you will awake and tell me the formula.  Hey, wake up!  Hmm, what else is loud and obnoxious?  Why won't you wake up?!
Plankton	No! It's a lie! Therapy doesn't really work. You're still sick! Very, very sick!
Plankton	Plan, shman. I'm going to wing it. What's the worst thing that could happen?  I'm in. That was easy. Maybe today is the day I'm going to steal the Krabby Patty formula...
Plankton	Well...if you transfer the Krabby Patty formula to me, I'll forget your gross negligence.
Plankton	Oww, oww! My wittle arm!
Plankton	Then came the fateful day that I paid an innocent visit to the deathtrap known as the Krusty Krab.
Plankton	Mr. Krabs, can you identify this item?
Plankton	To, you know. Say hello to my once good friend, Mr. Krabs. What?
Plankton	No, no, no, no!
Plankton	Hey!
Plankton	Fine, I'm wrong and you're right.
Plankton	You're a W.I.F.E.. Wired Integratred Female Electroencephlagraph.
Plankton	Hmmm, I guess she's not a poetry fan. [heart] Poetry, love notes--nothing's working. Perhaps something personal.
Plankton	No. I program the robot. Did you enjoy the gift I sent you?
Plankton	I've reservations for two, tonight.
Plankton	Hello, my dear. I must say you look ravishing tonight.
Plankton	It's on the back of the phone book! Come on! I paid a lotta money for that ad!  Never mind, Never mind. I'd like to hear about you.
Plankton	This delectable creature is your mother?
Plankton	That's more like it.
Plankton	What are you talking about?
Plankton	Somebody call heaven because I think an angel's gone missing.
Plankton	Would you marry me?
Plankton	What is this? There's somebody else, isn't there?
Plankton	No, no, not really. I mean, not at first. I mean uh...honey bunch? Uh-oh.  Oh, well, 'tis better to loved and lost then never to be loved at all!
Plankton	Psst...  I, Man Ray, have returned from the murky depths to seek my revenge and banish your souls to the nether regions. Their defenses are strong, but they are no match for my Man Ray ray.
Plankton	All right, SpongeBob, but you're squandering my talents.
Plankton	I have presented you with a monetary offering as custom dictates. My wish, ne my command, is to be taller. Just a little? Just big enough to crush my enemies, like the vermin they are!
Plankton	There's no pulling, Krabs. Can't you see my peace offering?
Plankton	What's the point? Do you know when the last time I had a customer was?
Plankton	I'm serious, Krabs. Soon the Chum Bucket will be a nice little store for bric-a-brac and bubblegum.
Plankton	Come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye. We have a big day ahead of us at the Chumporium Gift Shop.
Plankton	But I found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula. And I found it all right here in novelty items.
Plankton	Well, if you don't believe me, that's your problem not mine.
Plankton	What's this?  Hey, Krabs!
Plankton	Eugene?
Plankton	Sure.
Plankton	Oh, come on. Just fall back. Trust me, I'll catch you.
Plankton	I can't believe you would even think...
Plankton	Yeah, baby! This is it. Yeah! Whoo!  I got it! I got it! My diabolical, extremely convoluted plan worked! I should've been a politician.
Plankton	Really?! Wait a minute! That's my job!  Blast it! It's bad enough I have to compete with this joker. Now there's this?! KelpShakes.
Plankton	They're everywhere.
Plankton	My eye, my eye, my eye!
Plankton	Krabs, pipe down. You're gonna soil our plans if you wake up the watchdog.
Plankton	Let's beat it!
Plankton	It's easy. Just smile and hand the cashier the money.
Plankton	Oh, believe it, Krabs. Now let's get to the lab and find out what this stuff is made of.  What's the secret ingredient, Karen?
Plankton	Really? Let me try that.  Actually, there is a bit of a pungent aftertaste.
Plankton	Look at us!
Plankton	It's good to be home.
Plankton	Happy Birthday Krabs!
Plankton	Yeah. You can buy things with it.
Plankton	Skill, schmill, Krabs, baby. Who needs skill when science is on your side? We'll make that burger, and when we do, we will rule the school!
Plankton	Just look at them, Eugene. The very people who ridiculed me are now feasting on my recipe.
Plankton	Stop! You're gonna bust it!
Plankton	Lies!
Plankton	Most of it's true, except for what really happened! We had created the tastiest burger. That's when things became unsavory.
Plankton	This isn't about money, Eugene.
Plankton	Now that's a handsome looking burger.
Plankton	Well, it was your fault the patty was tainted.
Plankton	I think not, Rag Boy.
Plankton	Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir.
Plankton	You wouldn't have that recipe if it weren't for me.
Plankton	I'm sorry, Krabs, old buddy.
Plankton	Excuse me?  Do you have anything in a size negative five?
Plankton	Whew. Huh?
Plankton	Or perhaps a bran muffin?
Plankton	Do your worst, Krabs!
Plankton	No, SpongeBob, I always...
Plankton	You've got the easy part. I'd like to see you do my job.
Plankton	That's right. run, Krabs. For I have found your Achilles heel. I'll freeze you out of business and I'll do it using your thermostat!  What the--? Oh, no. Code red! Abandon ship!  No matter. In four to six hours, I will have my revenge.
Plankton	Yes, flee that frozen wasteland. Warmth and joy have left your lives.  Hey, buddy. you want to eat The Chum Bucket?  Fine! At least Krabs' place is deserted. Hey! The customers are coming back.  I don't understand. What's bringing them back?  What the--?
Plankton	I'll be right back.
Plankton	Fascinating. Well, got to go.
Plankton	Yes, I'm going to make it.
Plankton	I'm not giving up yet, Krabs. I've still got my secret weapon.  The thermostat!
Plankton	Oh, brother. Just look at this place. Might as well be a mausoleum. Abysmal. Oh, well. at least it's structurally sound.  Forget this! I'm sick of not having any business.
Plankton	Oh, I know. Why don't you paint the entire Chum Bucket?
Plankton	Amazing. I didn't have to trick the tall one.  My plan is falling right into place. With those three boobs preoccupied, stealing the formula will be a snap!
Plankton	Secret formula, here I come.
Plankton	I can't wait to see Krabs' face when he discovers that I've absconded with The Krabby Patty secret formula.
Plankton	Can't you two do anything right?! I give you one simple task after another andJust forget it. It was foolish of me to think this plan would ever work when nothing else in my life is panned out. Telemarketinglife guardingcreative writingall such bitter failures.
Plankton	I just need to sneak past Krabs, and I'm home-free.  Where could that stingy crab be?  Still don't see him.  The safe! I'm in the clear, baby!  It's beautiful.  No, no tears. Not yet.  There's work to be done.  Ha-ha! At long last!  And the secret formula isone bottle of molting lotion, take passport photo, get new safe . This isn't the secret formula! It's a to do list!  Huh? What happened to The Krusty Krab? Huh? What happened to The Chum Bucket?!  Curses! This isn't what I meant by renovation.
Plankton	Don't nag me, Karen. I've had a long day.
Plankton	How'd you know it was me?
Plankton	Never! Never! I'll never get Krabs' formula! Mr. Krabs is too stupid and is too powerful! If only there were a way to render him helpless!
Plankton	I've done it! Nothing can stop me now! My goo goo gas will transform Krabs into a tiny helpless infant!  The key to the Krusty Krab. This is easier than I hoped.  He's a little bigger than I imagined.  Ow! Ow! Ow!
Plankton	Fools, you'll never hold me! Your primitive shackles are no match for my genius.  I'm free! Free!
Plankton	Yes.
Plankton	Now you're just talking gibberish. What I really need is to spray Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.
Plankton	That's right, SpongeBob, I'm back! And you won't stop me this time.  What? SpongeBob's a baby but Krabs is back to normal  It seems the second dose acts as an antidote! [he is turned back into a baby again] One squirt equals baby, two squirts equals adult!  Or is it three squirts for baby and four squirts for adult.  Barnacles, I've run out of gas!
Plankton	This!  What's the matter, baby? Are you gonna cry?  What the heck happened to you? This isn't baby gas! It's senior citizen spray!
Plankton	This baby gas is worthless! At least you're way too old to stop me from stealing a Krabby Patty!
Plankton	That was almost too easy.  No! I demand you geezers release me!
Plankton	Excuse me, what aisle did you get that from?
Plankton	What is it now, Karen?
Plankton	Everyone say your ABCs!  Now when you turn into babies,  you stay babies! Hey, Krabs, catch!
Plankton	Yeow!  Huh? I don't believe it! Krabby Patty Formula! He's teething on it!  Give it here, you big stupid baby!  Ow.  I've got it! Just like taking candy from a baby! Get it, Krabs? I'm taking candy from   Hey! What are you doing?  Uh-oh.  Ahem!  Mama's evil little genius needs a
Plankton	These Atlanteans leave a room full of the most advanced weaponry unguarded? No wonder they got lost.  Oh, my! There will be no one to stop me this time!
Plankton	I'll destroy all of you--
Plankton	Never trust kids, Squidward. Never trust kids.
Plankton	Wha...?!  Thanks, babe. You're too good to me.  A Mermaid Man action figure...And a Barnacle Boy eraser?!  Look at me. I'm Barnacle Boy. Look at me. I'm Mermaid Man.  Krabs!  Sure! Why didn't I think of this before? If Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy can build Krabs up, they can tear him down, too.  Ding dong.  Hello, boys.
Plankton	, you two look like a couple of ladies' men, am I right?  I knew it! Just look at that heroic chin.  Those chiseled features.  That bra.  But what's this? Dandruff?
Plankton	Wise decision, gentlemen.  Hey, what do we have here? You fellas look a little peaked.  Hmm, this shouldn't be. I wonder.  Say, this isn't Professor Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo! It's Professor Plankton's  Mind Control Shampoo!  With conditioner. Time to prepare for your next role, fellas, as my zombies!
Plankton	They're terrible! You hate Krabby Patties.
Plankton	Yes. Yes!   It's working.
Plankton	Food? Oh, yeah. Never thought I'd get this far.
Plankton	Those nincompoops are better salesmen than I suspected.
Plankton	No.
Plankton	I think it's time for you to lose some weight, fatty. That's what this is.
Plankton	Yes! Yes!
Plankton	Don't give another penny to those fast-food phonies. That's right, they stole my idea. My, my, my... [the end of the periscope breaks off, he falls down and rolls into some wet mud]
Plankton	What?
Plankton	Excuse me, gents! But what's with all the hullabaloo?
Plankton	Curse you!
Plankton	Cops, I need you!
Plankton	Good morning, Mr. SquarePants!
Plankton	After everything I've done for you.
Plankton	Hi, SpongeBob.
Plankton	Gahh!  Are you out of your mind? Er, I mean, that was a delightful song you were singing.
Plankton	What band? I don't have a band.
Plankton	Hmm? Uh yea, great.
Plankton	Uh, if you guys don't like the name, uh
Plankton	The best kind of lyrics are the ones that are deep and revealing. Something only you know  Secret recipe.
Plankton	Nope
Plankton	When nobody's there?
Plankton	You will never speak of this to anyone. (Scene skips to in front of the Krusty Krab.) Come on, come on, hurry up.
Plankton	What, no, I was in it for the music, man!
Plankton	I, the amazing Plankton, with the use of prestidigitation...  ...will make a Krabby Patty disappear before your very eyes.  First, I'll need a volunteer from the audience.
Plankton	Greetings, citizens of Bikini Bottom. Behold my imperial Chum Coliseum!  I vow to introduce to this fair city, culture, in the form of hand to hand grappling!  I intend to enrich your lives culturally, by exhibiting the moist spectacle of gladiators in mortal conflict!  My corporate underwriters told me to mention that it's free!  Come one! Come all! Remember, kids love gladiators.
Plankton	I can still feel the burns, which is why I removed all molten liquid from this maneuver. And it's why this time, I will be the one with all the customers. And Krabs will be the pathetic one, in an empty restaurant, stuck with a computer for a wife.  Uh, sorry, honey.
Plankton	Now, release the opponent.
Plankton	This is ridiculous! I order a simple brutal mauling for my denizens, and I get a circus act! Time for phase 2!  Chum on a stick! Get your fresh chum right here! Some chum for you miss?
Plankton	You don't get this kind of entertainment with a Krabby Patty, do you?
Plankton	Oh, just the usual ingredients. Some jellyfish squeezings, whale blubber, sea horse snout, and a sprinkle of anchor rust.
Plankton	Finally, victory is mine! I win, I win, I win!
Plankton	Wh-what did you say?
Plankton	What?
Plankton	Elaborate.
Plankton	What happens after we eat 'em?
Plankton	What's that?
Plankton	N is for anywhere, anytime at all!
Plankton	And after that we frolicked through the flowers and then we...
Plankton	You can't rush these things, you know.
Plankton	SpongeBuddy! Yoohoo!
Plankton	It's not what you think.
Plankton	How long what?
Plankton	What are we eating this time, Karen?
Plankton	Is this a joke?
Plankton	Okay, you caught me.
Plankton	Try it, tell me what you think.
Plankton	I don't know anymore.
Plankton	What?
Plankton	Did you see that? I didn't even have to threaten his life! He loved it!
Plankton	Well hello, Nat.
Plankton	Is it okay?
Plankton	What? You're coming back again?
Plankton	I'm just saying, I no longer need to conquer you, Krabs. I've got my own winning recipe now.
Plankton	Say, Nat, do you have any friends?
Plankton	What have you done with Karen, you brute?!
Plankton	Good thing I sprang for the dual spoon installation.
Plankton	Ha-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-huh?
Plankton	I should have known! Why would anyone ever eat my slop?
Plankton	: Why? I haven't done anything.
Plankton	Oh, come on Karen, please!
Plankton	We don't serve Krabby Kola, we carry Bucket Bubbler and Chum Cherry Blast.
Plankton	"Honestly, I don't think anyone in Bikini Bottom would know a decent meal if it looked them right in the eye and said, ""Hello! I'm a decent meal, wonderful to meet you! Please pay money for me and then put me in your mouth so your old pal Plankton doesn't lose everything he's spent his entire life working for!"""
Plankton	My eye is burning and I don't know why!
Plankton	I'll show you woman!
Plankton	Feast your, uh, screen on this.
Plankton	They're supposed to do that. Next, Behold! The Noxious Enterprises Super SPU-31 Liquid-Cooled Mobile Processing Unit, a mind staggering combination of both power! And refinement.
Plankton	Okay here we go!!! Are you going to make me get the picture down again!!!???
Plankton	Dear Neptune!
Plankton	You know Karen, with you around, I'm beginning to wonder how I'm still alive.
Plankton	Okay team, listen up. We're on our own now so we don't have anything holding us back. Now I know you all look upon me kindly since I am your creator, but the last thing the Chum Bucket needs is, if were going to be victorious, is a bunch of soft, uh, software. Does everybody understand?
Plankton	Heh heh heh. Now let's see Krabs stop this. I'll show him. I'll show them all!!!
Plankton	Uuhhhh, moron! Okay, I'll make it simple: Krabs give me secret formula or I bring big boom boom to the Krusty Krab. Got it?
Plankton	Oh curse you cruel fate. Once again, you've left me covered in the sticky goo of my own folly. Only this time, I'm all alone.
Plankton	What you gonna do, machines these days, right? Umm, listen sweetie, I'm sorry about what I said. Truth is, I could never replace you honey-bunch. Lets go home hun?
Plankton	Okay, Karen. Which one's better?
Plankton	For the Chum Bucket! Where you can enjoy a nice helping of chum.  Oh, boy this is so...  ...good. The chum is.
Plankton	What would that be?
Plankton	Hello sir, and welcome to the Chum Bucket! Er, sir?
Plankton	Uh, I'm sorry
Plankton	Zero
Plankton	Apparently, dumb sells chum. And I believe I've just found our Advertising Director.
Plankton	No? How 'bout your little friend? Hi SpongeBob!
Plankton	I'm gonna see how our advertising guru is doing.  What brilliant slogans have you come up with this week Patrick?
Plankton	HEY EVERYONE! CHUM IS FUM!
Plankton	Karen, babe, you don't need help when you have a catchy slogan like mine.
Plankton	We're having a board meeting here! We need ideas!
Plankton	Nothing can stop me now!
Plankton	Check? You want money for those stupid catchphrases? Anybody can sell to my idiot customers  They're buffoons, morons, they'll buy anything I sell them. They're the dumbest of the dumb,  the stupidest of the stupid,  they're dummies, dweebs and doodoo dunderheads. I can keep that rabble right where I want 'em! Huh?
Plankton	And now the smell of defeat so deeply penetrates my soul that my very skin is permeated with its foul stench.  Thanks for asking.
Plankton	I command you to!
Plankton	Special day?
Plankton	Enough with the riddles, woman! Just tell me what this proud moment in my life is!
Plankton	What??? Sorry. I wasn't listening.  Well, you can tell me later.
Plankton	Uh, I didn't buy Karen anything.
Plankton	My loove?
Plankton	L...
Plankton	Llll...uhhh...vuh!
Plankton	Uhh... well, uhh  she does make a lot of beeping sounds.
Plankton	Me me me me me me me... ...Me me me me me...
Plankton	Ready? But what do I sing?
Plankton	No, I'm just nervous. I don't know what flying insects have to do with it.
Plankton	You really liked it?
Plankton	Get your hand off my wife!
Plankton	That's Fantastic. Where's that formula?
Plankton	Yes!
Plankton	Oh No.
Plankton	Ow!
Plankton	It's just no use!
Plankton	I am.
Plankton	SpongeBob!  Why must you always ruin my plans?
Plankton	What? You just went in a circle. Why didn't you just stay in the Krusty Krab?
Plankton	My pen is out of ink.  Okay, okay, go ahead.
Plankton	Please, Krabs, no! I can't take it anymore! No more launching, please?!
Plankton	So, everything, that means I know where it is!
Plankton	Turn on the navigation system, honey! Let's get this show on the road!
Plankton	Well, let's just dig deeper and go around it!
Plankton	It's just a shame no one else can see it!
Plankton	Oh, I'll take that!  Eat your blackened, twisted, money-grubbing heart out, Krabs!  I'm even profiting off of your most loyal ally! I'm running out of space for this stuff! Got an empty safe I can borrow, Krabs?  But seriously, this is getting really heavy.
Plankton	Krabs, you can't just slither down here and steal all my customers! It's unethical!
Plankton	Fine, Krabs, have it your way!
Plankton	I can't make it. We're doomed!
Plankton	No more skulduggery of any kind.
Plankton	What? We're still working together, come on! You're helping me steal your formula!
Plankton	And eat at the Chum Bucket or perish!
Plankton	Perfect, he's headed for the front door. Now it's time to make my exit.
Plankton	What's going on? Where am I?
Plankton	Wow! Wait a minute, that's it! I think I found out how to get the Krabby Patty formula once and for all!
Plankton	As serious as a shark attack.
Plankton	Watch where you're standin', coral brains!
Plankton	Uh, what are y-y'all talkin' about, SpongeBob? It's your old pal, in the livin' fur.
Plankton	Yeah, but this is yer old buddy Sandy Cheeks.  Why, you and me are as closer 'n two catfish in a skillet.
Plankton	283 seconds. I can't believe I'm getting all this straight from the source. How could this get any easier?
Plankton	Okay, I'll stand on thata' side for a better view.
Plankton	Almost there...
Plankton	Gah!
Plankton	Only from my cold, dead feelers!
Plankton	Hey, I was watching that!
Plankton	Looks like this failure has a customer. Hello. Are you lost?
Plankton	Groan.
Plankton	Yes.
Plankton	Mmph!
Plankton	There he is!  Get out of the way! This is it!  Move it! Ha, ha! You're mine!
Plankton	Thanks to your brilliant aim, honey, I'm stuck inside that fool of a fry cook.
Plankton	Heh, heh, special sauce. Wait, soap is the special sauce?
Plankton	Huh?
Plankton	Enough with these petty carnal senses. If I'm going to get the Krabby Patty recipe, the brain!  Honk!  Ugh!  Hi, friend.  Superficial Greetings? What kind of idiot--  Personal Opinions? Knock-knock Jokes? No, no, no, no! This is all useless! I'm gonna have to go in deeper.  Ugh.  Where am I?
Plankton	Aagh, all of these secrets are lame! Wait a minute. What's this?  The secret recipe isn't in the brain? It's located in the heart. How cheesy.  Ugh. Uh.  The Krabby Patty recipe. Yes, yes, yes! Here it is!  My mouth is watering.  My taste buds are tingling. Mm, mm. oh, yeah. It feels so good. I can feel it all the way to my finger....stumps. All of the ingredients coming together in perfect harmony. And it's all mine!  Hwuh. Okay, that was weird. Like I was saying, the Krabby Patty recipe is the delicious sole property of the Krusty Krab. Hwuh. What's happening to me?  It's all warm and fuzzy! It's ---  It's ---  It's beautiful!  All of the delicious ingredients living in perfect harmony.
Plankton	The Krabby Patty recipe is the delicious sole property of the Krusty Krab.
Plankton	Wyaagh!  What the?  This is the most bizarre precipitation I've ever slipped and fallen in.  Eeeaugh! It reeks!  But it tastes delicious!  Darn it, I almost had an idea!  Oh, I do. I do have an idea! !
Plankton	Sorry to disappoint, Krabs, but I've done no such thing. I'm simply using a gift somebody left me to make my chum taste good.
Plankton	Next Chumstomer in line, please!  Hello?
Plankton	You're right! And it's packed with flavor!
Plankton	Well I'm taking a bath.
Plankton	Because I'm already outside, you bumbling barnacles! Open your eyes for cryin' out loud!
Plankton	Well, that certainly was an interesting series of words that just tumbled out past your teeth and lips, but frankly, my dear sponge, I don't give a barnacle.
Plankton	Seems as though the ayes have it. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got superhighway preparations to be attending to. Toodles!
Plankton	Uh lower, a little lower, yeah, that's it!  Now who could that be during my hour of triumph?  How appropriate.
Plankton	Karen, is that you??
Plankton	Wait! I didn't count on all of you working together!
Plankton	You will be re-re-doing it when I'm through with you!
Plankton	Well I constrict you to reconsider.
Plankton	Well, we'll see what Mr. Feather has to say about that.
Plankton	Bl bl blubber?
Plankton	Don't say it!
Plankton	That should keep her out!
Plankton	See for yourself!
Plankton	Yes, Karen. I can hear you. Could you please bring it up? I can't risk stepping into the light. The whale might see me.
Plankton	Gastric acid?  No!  I can't take it! Oh, this is driving me crazy!
Plankton	Forget it kid. I'll just wait for the next bus. Go on back to the Krusty Krab and enjoy yourself.
Plankton	What difference does it make? There's no point ever since I've been tortured by that blasted whale.
Plankton	No, of course not.
Plankton	You don't scare me, Krabs.
Plankton	Doesn't feel so good on the other end of the stick, doesn't it scaredy pants? I feel wonderful!
Plankton	What?
Plankton	: Oh, Grandma, you know I always have more pudding for you!
Plankton	: Well, Grandma, that's the sweetest, most tender...
Plankton	: Thanks, Sonny! I'm just going to take it home; I left my bifocals there.
Plankton	: I want to know all about your lifeyour job, where the secret formula is...  I mean...
Plankton	: Oh, I had the most horrible dream of my life! I was dressed up as...! Holy mother of Neptune, it's true.
Plankton	: I want to know all about your lifeyour job, where the secret formula is...  I mean...
Plankton	: Nope.
Plankton	: Would I? Uh, yeah, I would. Uh, SpongeBob, would you mind terribly if we used the rear entrance? I'm a little shy around new people.
Plankton	: Never mind. Just get me into the
Plankton	: Nothing, go ahead! Let's see how this decoy floats your boat. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Plankton	: Why he?
Plankton	: B-But-But-But I...Grandma, I can...
Plankton	Owwwww!
Plankton	The Main Drain? What are you to bothering me for? I mean I-I don't know where the Main Drain is. It's a myth anyway, it doesn't exist.
Plankton	We were the two ding-a-lings who pulled that plug.
Plankton	Ow.
Plankton	Looks like it's starting to roll my way for a change. And nothing dares stand in my way!  Uh-oh.  I knew I'd make it?
Plankton	Oh, drat.
Plankton	Okay, butler, you may have hoodwinked the sponge, but I ain't no pushover!
Plankton	Uh, I-I mean, give SpongeBob back the key.
Plankton	Yeah, have a better look.  And thanks for the key!
Plankton	It's too easy.
Plankton	I can explain, Eugene. I, uh, I was just keeping it warm for you. Yeah.
Plankton	Curse that Krabs and his cheering crowds! Big whoop-- a stupid time capsule.
Plankton	Secret recipe, where are you? Aha!
Plankton	Okay, now what's he saying?
Plankton	A fresh batch ofooh, this is good. This is really good!
Plankton	I have no idea, that's why I'm asking you what he said!
Plankton	Good morning sir! My name is Sheldon R. Shellcleaner, owner and operator of Super Shell Cleaner Vacations Unlimited. Can I ask you a question? Are you tire of your dirty shell resulting in tireless hours of...
Plankton	...all yours! Now I know what your thinking but I got you covered!  A temporary shell will be provided for you to wear while yours is being cleaned, and all of this is free of charge of course.
Plankton	Ugh...
Plankton	No I'm not.
Plankton	Karen! Oh, sorry. I thought you were someone else.
Plankton	If I could just have a...  Krabby Patty before I go...
Plankton	Yes!
Plankton	Good day, sir. I'm just here to sample some of your delicious Krabby fare.  Whoa, hold on there, fido!  I'm going! I'm going!
Plankton	Because today I have completed my greatest invention. Behold!
Plankton	It worked! In this new gaseous form, I will be able to silently squeeze through the cracks of the Krusty Krab. Ehahahahaha!
Plankton	Hey! Cut it out!
Plankton	Eh? Did you say transporter?  Interesting.  Hey! Maybe if I combine this device with my own invention, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine! I mean, I think I have the right parts in my lab, eh?
Plankton	Haha, yes.
Plankton	No, not that doohickey. THIS doohickey! Just plug your teleporter into my device, and with our combined power we shall conquer the world!
Plankton	What! He'll just get in the way!
Plankton	Oh, boy. Try again!
Plankton	Shall we activate it together?
Plankton	Yes! My plan worked! And now I have no further use for you two goody goodies!  Using your technology, I can teleport myself directly to the Krusty Krab and the Krabby Patty formula [singing in high voice] will be mine! [laughs evilly]
Plankton	Aren'tcha gonna try and take it back from me?
Plankton	Hey!
Plankton	No, not that. It's coming from this way.  Aha. That delectable odor is coming from that shack.  Must know more.
Plankton	Get used to it, Krabs. Your Krabby Patty is old news. Once I steal the Flabby Patty recipe your customers will be eating at the Chum Bucket.
Plankton	Won't!
Plankton	I've so got the drop on that dunderhead Krabs.
Plankton	You'll be hearin' from my lawyer is what you'll be hearin'!
Plankton	I get to cut in line, so move aside. Move aside!  What is this world coming to when a fake restaurant critic can't get cutsies?
Plankton	Yeah, I don't see that workin' out.
Plankton	Not so fast, Krabs!  Hahahaha!
Plankton	We co-op-er-a-ted.
Plankton	In fact, I think it's time we repay him, don't you?
Plankton	Hey. Hey! Go around! Go around!
Plankton	Chum Nuggets...get them before  my arm falls off...
Plankton	I see you...  Zap!  Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty.  Crush!  Lick, lick!
Plankton	Waaaaaah!  Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh?  No! No! No! Not the face!
Plankton	You don't stand a chance, Krabs! Karen and I--I mean, my worm and I, are gonna whip your tail fin!  Right, worm?
Plankton	Hehehehe!  Locked?! Ugh.[takes out cutter]Good thing I brought this along.[tries to cut safe, but the cutter slides to the ceiling with Plankton, spins 3 circles, makes two holes in ceiling, falls off, cuts off Plankton's antennae, and rolls away]I'm gonna need something with more firepower.
Plankton	Secret formula, you are mine!
Plankton	Keep your pants on out there! I'll get your Krabby Patty just as soon as I get this bottle open.
Plankton	Hahaha! I got it now, Krabsy.
Plankton	Yowza! Ow! That hurt on so many levels... Okay, I give up. You win again, Krabs.
Plankton	Hehehe!
Plankton	I better go while the going's good.
Plankton	Morons!
Plankton	No, computer-brain. The skinny one may have been the gateway to the secret formula all along. As a veteran employee, he must know the secret formula, too.
Plankton	Yes.
Plankton	I hope you don't mind me painting on your property, but the light here, it's simply transcendent this time of day.
Plankton	There's nothing a little duct tape and surgical tubing can't accomplish.  Ow! I knew I should've used pipe cleaners. Hello, I'm your long-lost relative. Can I have the secret formula?
Plankton	None of my tactics are making any impression on him whatsoever.
Plankton	Wait, don't irrigate me. I've come to hear your music. It soothes the place my soul would occupy if I had one.
Plankton	Sweet mother of Aphrodite! Please make it end!
Plankton	Encore, encore, encore!
Plankton	Skinny arms a flappin' long nose looks real swell. Shiny head is bulging he plays really well. On the fact that he's a genius you can surely bet. This strange-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet. To hear his music playing is like, uh, music to my ears. His delightful melodies reduce grown men to tears. If you haven't heard this mollusk play you ain't hear nothing yet. This funny-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet. No one does it better. He's the best there is. When you ask him how he does it he says...
Plankton	When you're not sharing your songs of joy and splendor, one might find you working a shift at the Krusty Krab, correct?
Plankton	But... surely, you've been near the grill. You must've seen something.
Plankton	But then I'll never get my hands on that secret formula.  Uh-oh. My professional-grade earplugs! No!  Come back, I need you!  Stop playing this infernal pipe! You're killing me!
Plankton	You do? Oh.
Plankton	"""A meeting of the minds to discuss the ultimate downfall of the Krusty Krab!?"" This sounds too good to be true!"
Plankton	Silence, red one! Withstand my slides!
Plankton	Now we're cooking with blubber! My second honeymoon, it started out as any romantic getaway would. With five days of round-the-clock surveillance...
Plankton	No, of course not!  Just think of it as our second honeymoon.
Plankton	See it?! It almost split me in half!
Plankton	Let me give you a hand with that, honey.
Plankton	Is that Kelp Cheese?
Plankton	AHHHH!
Plankton	Sleep well, babe, he he he he.
Plankton	You're not getting away this time!
Plankton	AAHHHHH!  Alright, alright! I give up! I know what I'm beat!
Plankton	From the same place this is going, the Chum Bucket laboratory! Nice doing business, Krabs! he he he he!
Plankton	Bu...but I don't think that's such a good...
Plankton	No! I probably never will.
Plankton	Karen, my dear, I think you're onto something. Looks like it's time for an upgrade!
Plankton	Karen, what am I doing wrong?
Plankton	2 eyes, huh? I think I know a cry baby who fits that description!
Plankton	Get a grip!
Plankton	Hi, SpongeBob, great to see you, buddy!
Plankton	Formula, what formula?  I forgot the formula! I can't imagine what got into me.
Plankton	Aww, it's a little puppy doggy!
Plankton	Ah, a few blobs of ink doesn't prove a thing. I'm as evil as ever, I'll prove it right now by stealing the Krabby Patty secret formula.
Plankton	Oh no.
Plankton	That's right Krabs. Unbelievably, I found it lying on the ground!  So I'm giving it back to you, take it.
Plankton	My life of evil is over.  Hey, why is it so dark in here?
Plankton	Yes, thanks to you I'm evil again, and as a token of my appreciation I'll give you all a rousing send-off with my infra-red security security attack lasers!  Oh well. Depth perception's overrated anyway.
Plankton	Heh, heh, heh, that was almost too easy. Plankton old boy, you're home-free!
Plankton	You gotta be kidding me!  Hello? Hello? Open up! Open up!
Plankton	Interesting. It appears I've won more than I bargained for.
Plankton	Me, you imbecile!
Plankton	No, you have! Criminal Accomplice!
Plankton	You may thank my new and original idea, darling.  Free samples!
Plankton	I just said they're free!
Plankton	It's not fair! If Krabs gave away free samples he wouldn't get this treatment!
Plankton	Oh, that wasn't me that was... uh... my... brother-in-law, yeah, er, Flankton.
Plankton	Sweet and delicious victory, you are mine!
Plankton	Almost done.
Plankton	Computer wife, don't start with me! This plan is foolproof I tell you. FOOLPROOF!  Not only will I soon grasp the formula, but I'll get rid of your bad memory as well.
Plankton	I'm afraid so. But can you blame me? She's got triple the processing, all the latest software, and a sleek space-age design.  The whole package.
Plankton	Oh, why did I program her with a jealousy scheduler.
Plankton	Huh, what happened?
Plankton	Hey, what's the hold up, Karen 2? That secret formula's not going to steal itself you know.
Plankton	Ow!
Plankton	I hope this works. Oh Karen, please wake up! I promise never to take you for granted again.
Plankton	Two of you? Heh, well that is strange.
Plankton	Hello, yes. I have a complaint.
Plankton	Hmm.  There are exactly five hundred thousand...  Three hundred...
Plankton	Yeah.
Plankton	What?
Plankton	Drat.
Plankton	Okay, we get it already.
Plankton	Yeah, that's what it says.
Plankton	Fine.  Can I go now?
Plankton	Keep it moving, nice and orderly. Hey, Eugene, want a free Krabby Patty? Just guess how many customers I can fit into the Chum Bucket.
Plankton	I'm way ahead of you, Karen!  There is one element in the known universe that can turn even the nicest sap into the biggest jerk they can be! And I, Plankton have discovered it. Behold! Jerktonium! I'll give everyone in Bikini Bottom a present of the most innocent of all goodies. The fruitcake! Each and every slice will be laced with Jerktonium! Once ingested, no one can help becoming the biggest, creepiest, meanest jerk ever! Then Santa will realize that Sheldon J. Plankton isn't so bad after all! And then I'll get what I  want for Christmas, the Krabby Patty secret formula!  And now for the main ingredient, JERKTONIUM! Okay, Jerktonium, do your stuff! It's complete! Ha ha! The Jerkmaker 9000 will make doling, outraging fruitcake a breeze! Now, who's gonna be my first victim?
Plankton	So, how do you feel, kinda cranky?
Plankton	Hmm... He must have gotten a piece without Jerktonium! Here. Have some more.
Plankton	You know what? Knock yourself out.  Stupid hunk of-tonium! My gift to Bikini Bottom. Boy, oh, boy.
Plankton	Success! Soon all the Bikini Bottomites will be jerks! Now I just need to figure out what to do about old SpongeBoy.
Plankton	Uh-oh.
Plankton	Well, the smell doesn't make me wretch...  Hey, that ain't bad at all!  It's actually amazing!  This is gold in the form of chum! Squidward, my friend, you'll be the toast of Bikini Bottom! This recipe is going to make you a star.
Plankton	What's the hold-up? You said it took exactly 24 hours.
Plankton	What?! Oh, you're not pinning this on me! You said you didn't care if it was ready or not!
Plankton	Boy, I don't know what it is, but I feel like there's something in the air! Today is the day I finally get a Krabby Patty!
Plankton	Ahhhhhhhhhh!  OOF!
Plankton	You might as well close up shop right now Krabs. Your customers won't miss a thing
Plankton	My restaurant. My laboratory. My evil inventions. All about to be flattened! Just give me a moment to say my goodbyes.  Farewell, stench-vision goggles. Farewell, Chum Bucket replicator. Farewell, hypnotizer helmet. We had some diabolical times together, didn't we?  So long, sonic cannon that destroys every known material in the universe.
Plankton	Not to worry, my lady. I have a plan.
Plankton	All right. My wife's not for sale.  But everything else must go!  Well, wifey. Looks like it's time to proceed to the next phase.   Who wants free money?
Plankton	Oh, not me, your bureaucraticness. I completed my petition.
Plankton	But that's not fair! .]
Plankton	Hello sir! I'd like to purchase the Krusty Krab restaurant you have in your...where is it?
Plankton	Really?
Plankton	Pests!? What are you talking about?  AN URCHIN!!!  I HATE those things! This won't do at all. I can't steal the Secret Formula with that varmint running around!  I propose a truce Krabs: I'll help you get rid of that creature and I'll promise not to steal the Secret Formula until it's gone. Crook's honor.
Plankton	Ok. Maybe the Death Robot wasn't the best idea...
Plankton	Oh brother...
Plankton	Fine  H-h-hey there handsome! You're cute!...for a parasite. Woah there, buddy! Why don't we start with a nice romantic stroll? Outside, far away from the Krusty Krab! And the Secret Formula... Ok! OUCH!  Hey! What kind of an urchin do you think I am!?   What could be worse than being romantically pursued by a ravage sea urchin!?  A HUNDRED URCHINS!!!
Plankton	Yeah, yeah! Keep your shirt on!
Plankton	Do you mind?
Plankton	I mean the file?
Plankton	"I'm not even sure what ""that"" is..."
Plankton	Wait! Put me down!Uh oh... You can't eat me! I'm Bikini Bottom's most evil genius!
Plankton	Are we at the airport? Ahem! HEY! Gather 'round fellow convicts! It is I: the one and only Sheldon J. Plankton, evil genius!
Plankton	Ok gang! We need to bust out of this joint! Any thoughts?
Plankton	Chum? What use is chum?
Plankton	Really? Maybe I overlooked chum's hidden potential! Fellow ne'r-do-wells: If its chum you want its chum you shall have! Luckily, I happen to know the recipe! IT'S TIME FOR A JAILBREAK!!!
Plankton	Subtropical, vegetal matter!
Plankton	Sigh. IT'S TIME TO BREAK OUT OF PRISON, YOU DOPES!!!
Plankton	Uh oh... It worked!
Plankton	I gave you your freedom, now bring me the Krabby Patty Formula!
Plankton	EUREKA!
Plankton	Hey! Watch where you're pointing that thing buster!
Plankton	Just like clockwork. The twerp approaches. Time for phase three.
Plankton	Well, there is only one. And some say it has magical grilling powers.
Plankton	Feast your absorbent eyes on this!
Plankton	"Yes, a legend has been fulfilled today. Go forth, SpongeBob. Wouldn't want you to miss the lunch rush.  Or as I like to call it, ""Phase 4."""
Plankton	Well I can! The mystical SizzleMaster can do all!
Plankton	Drat!
Plankton	Dang it! I need SpongeBob to trust me behind that grill for this plan to work. Hmm. Oh! Hey SpongeBob!
Plankton	Sure!
Plankton	Karen! I thought I told you not to put smell sensors on the spatula!
Plankton	You deserve a break. And I've been able to handle everything else for you, so...
Plankton	Hey, I got an idea!  I can mix up some new patties in a jiff. If we just go get the Krabby Patty secret formula.
Plankton	Y-y-yes!  Wait how much disulfide?
Plankton	Oh, hardy-har-har!
Plankton	Ah, sweet karma. It can come from the most boneheaded of places.  Wait a second. What are those bouncing blobs of goo?
Plankton	I can't find this thing anywhere.  Come on, now. Think, Plankton.  If you were a giant bubble of dangerous goo, where would you be?
Plankton	What did you say?
Plankton	Well, that's for me to know and for you to clam up!
Plankton	That's right, come to Papa.
Plankton	Hello, down there, Krabs! Look, I brought you a pretty balloon! And in return, you can give me the Krabby Patty secret formula!
Plankton	You heard him, Bikini Bottom! It's time to kiss clean goodbye!
Plankton	Uh-oh.
Plankton	I can't believe it! After all these years, it's mine!  I'm so happy, I could just burst! This bubble that is!
Plankton	Guess who?
Plankton	Sure I do.
Plankton	Oh, just setting up the rest of the activities.
Plankton	Have you seen the calliope?
Plankton	Oh, don't bother to read it. Not on such a fun day.
Plankton	Unbelievable!
Plankton	Okay, have it your way. I don't mind bulldozing over each and every one... hey! Put me down!
Plankton	Oh, hi, SpongeBob.  I'm cryin' because I've got these two ice cream cones, but I only need one!  I don't know what to do with the other one!
Plankton	Isn't it great to get the things you desire? Like that ice cream cone, for instance.  You can have anything you want with a little training.
Plankton	Wonderful.  SpongeBob, don't let that guy sit on you! Assertiveness lesson #1: tell him to get off!
Plankton	Don't say it!  There's the guy who took your ice cream. Don't you want it back?
Plankton	Great! Now let him have it!
Plankton	You see how wonderful life can be, when you're maniacal?
Plankton	Now look what you've done! Tell that guy to go fall in a ditch!
Plankton	Forget it! I guess you don't have what it takes to be a stand-up guy.
Plankton	Okay, but this is your last chance!  Look at all those beach hogs soaking up your sun rays. Do you have what it takes to get a tan?
Plankton	SpongeBob that was genius! Look at all those kite fliers blocking your view!
Plankton	Oops.
Plankton	SpongeBob, stop! Before it's too late! Your kindness is bringing everybody back! Get back!  Wait!
Plankton	No...  My weapons!  Ouch!
Plankton	Er, money's not everything, you know.
Plankton	Yuhh!  This gives me an idea.  Owww!
Plankton	Ugh. Well, I finally did it I kissed a crab!
Plankton	Perfect!  When we're married, he'll  to tell me the secret formula!  Yeah!
Plankton	(Girl voice) Come on, Krabs  Let it all out!
Plankton	Get a hold of yourself, Krabs.
Plankton	Oh I love office parties. We got roller chair races and karaoke. Hey! I know a gag we can do. Copy our faces on the new copy machine!
Plankton	Alright. Party's over. Go home!
Plankton	"You'll be fine if you take tomorrow off.  Hello, SpongeBob CopyPants. Can you say ""Secret formula""?"
Plankton	Excellent! Now, off you go! Wait!  Just keeping track of my copy.
Plankton	But you can't work. You have yellow jaundice!
Plankton	[] Karen, did you know you're married to a genius?
Plankton	And stay away from any other SpongeBobs!
Plankton	Neptune's puddle! Now that SpongeBob's been corrupted by the other 2! What I need is a legion of Bobs. A full-lined blitz cream of Bobs. [] March! March my pretties and learn the formula!
Plankton	Uh, well, that's pattonly ridiculous!
Plankton	Quickly man! Before you fade, what's the formula?!
Plankton	Geez, What a cheapskate. I can't believe I failed again!
Plankton	One SpongeBob is more than the world can handle anyway. You're a unique snowflake.
Plankton	Eh, spoke too soon. Comeuppance in three. two... [] OW! Right on my keys!
Plankton	Riddle me this, computer wife, what's hollow, full of lies, and leaves a bad taste in your mouth?
Plankton	"This will be a good one, ""You stink."""
Plankton	Hello! Did someone say copepod?
Plankton	Don't worry secret formula, I'm comin' baby!
Plankton	Oh yeah?! What are you going to do about it Eugene?
Plankton	Finally, now is my chance to strike.
Plankton	Aren't you gonna try and stop me?
Plankton	Yes, you fools!
Plankton	That formula will be mine!
Plankton	I hope you like percussion, Eugene. Because these drumsticks really go bongo!
Plankton	Oh, you're right, Professor Krabface! I'm much too simple-minded to look there!
Plankton	Ain't that the truth? Hey, nothing gets past you. One could say you have the formula for honesty.
Plankton	Shell polish, slime deodorant, chew toys...
Plankton	Hello, sir...  Hello, sir! I'm selling Sweetie Patrol cookies! We have a lovely assortment of fungi and algae flavors.
Plankton	I forgot how much I hate pineapple.
Plankton	Nothin' in there.  Ooh, look at that.
Plankton	Where is it? Where is it? I know you're in here! You're not foolin' anybody! I went to college!
Plankton	Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Plankton	Ha! I lost him! Now, I'm lost!
Plankton	Ha, ha! I got it! I got it!
Plankton	Yes.  Yes he would! As dumb as Patrick!
Plankton	Sweet gashes molasses!
Plankton	Leave me be woman!
Plankton	Yeah!
Plankton	I know you're cookin' up something special in Home EC, Eugene! I want that formula!
Plankton	Not again!
Plankton	Hand over that secret formula, Krabs!
Plankton	Wait, what?! Acting class?!  No!!
Plankton	It was okay. He got my face right, but that voice is terrible.
Plankton	What a great idea.  Ugh!
Plankton	Hey, SpongeBo Whoa! I see you've got yourself a little problem with the cooties.
Plankton	Time to crash this lousy party. Get it? Lousy? Louse? Oh, I'm good.
Plankton	Great.
Plankton	No one asked you!  Are you happy now, Karen?
Plankton	I will not get out! This is my restaurant and no one can make me...  leave!!  Ow! Karen, baby. Come on, sugar lips, you know I'm sorry for everything I said.
Plankton	So is it cool if I crash here?
Plankton	Okay, fine!
Plankton	Yes!
Plankton	Hey! What? Get off! GetOh!  Oh, that's the spot.
Plankton	Me, aggressive?! How dare you?!  Maybe you're right. I can be a big jerk sometimes. I command you to help me be a nicer person!  I mean, will you please, please help me be a nicer person so Karen will take me back?
Plankton	Fine, but if he kisses me, I'm gonna lose it.  Ugh. After you.
Plankton	How dare you reject my act of kindness! Yah!
Plankton	Fine. Your color pink is not so repugnant.
Plankton	It's no use, SpongeBob. I'm just too brilliant to be nice! I'll never get Karen back now.
Plankton	That's a great idea! I'll cook up a scheme to make her jealous and crush her spirit!
Plankton	Yes, hello. I would like your most romantic table for myself and my beautiful date, Shelby Naughtica, the robot.
Plankton	Ugh.  Oh, my dear, Shelby Naughtica, you are the most beautiful woman I've ever laid my eye on.
Plankton	No! The whole point of this scheme was for me to get Karen back, and now you're ruining it!
Plankton	Now, Karen, take it easy!
Plankton	Ha-ha-ha, you fool! Now I will rule the streets!
Plankton	Whoa, big fella!
Plankton	Secret formula, ho!
Plankton	Open for business, baby!
Plankton	And the Krabby Patty is made of...
Plankton	Yes!
Plankton	No, Karen! That's just not gonna work anymore! Don't you see? We're done here.
Plankton	Forever.
Plankton	Yes! My plan is almost complete!
Plankton	Oh, I know you won't, Krabs, because I'm at the Krusty Krab right now stealing that formula.
Plankton	In your face, Krabs! Ha!
Plankton	So you're the real Krabs and SpongeBob.  Gimme that!
Plankton	(singing to real tune) O come, all ye fearful, cower as I crush you!
Plankton	(singing and marching to notes) De de de de de de de de, de de de de de de de de, de de de de de de-
Plankton	Is this thing... Hello?... Can't get it to... Greetings! It is I, Plankton! Boy, I'll tell you, Karen is really working my last nerve right now.
Plankton	And does she ever help me steal the secret formula?
Plankton	My evil genius video diary, by Sheldon J. Plankton.
Plankton	That's good, but I really want a wild one.
Plankton	Okay, that's not funny! You haven't heard the last of me!
Plankton	"Can your normal super villain do that? I don't think so!  Alas, the world is not ready for a talent like mine, but I'll get there some day.  You better watch your back, Justin Bottomfeeder.   ""N"" is for anywhere at anytime at all down here in the deep blue sea.  That's the stuff."
Plankton	What? It's just an ordinary Krabby  Oh, my goodness!
Plankton	Hold on.
Plankton	Well, the inside is done and ready for action.
Plankton	Again. Again.
Plankton	This is the Jellyfish Trauma Center, dunce. What do you think hap
Plankton	Ha-ha, I like it.
Plankton	That's it?  You'd better cough up that secret formula or else!
Plankton	You can't do this to me, Krabs!  !  Ouch.
Plankton	It's that thick-headed Krabs! He'll ruin everything!
Plankton	This is it, Plankton. Gently, now...
Plankton	Do you doubt me: Sheldon J. Plankton?  Okay, take Cousin Marvin there. He may look like a dumb, tiny plant, and he is, but dumb Marvin has planktonic plant frames make up nearly half the oxygen you're breathing right now. And you thought rainforests were doing all the work. You love all this big stuff, don't you? That's why you watch all the fancy TV shows. Ooh, look at the cute penguins! They're just like us.  Yeah, laugh it up, Flippy, because none of that stuff would exist without plankton, like me. I'm a zooplankton, a tiny animal just like all these guys.  Hi, Mom! Mom! So, my friends and I, we eat the Dumb Marvins. Then, small fish eat us, bigger animals eat them all the way up the food chain. Even the blue whale, the biggest animal that's ever lived, usually likes nothing more than a great mouthful of stupid krill. What this means is no plankton, no sea life, no Krabby Patties, no sushi, no SpongeBob, that wouldn't be bad, no NOTHING!! Do we feel important to you now: the food you eat, the air you breathe? Come on, people!  All right! Hold on, I'm not finished. Crude oil, ancient dead plankton buried in the rocks. You'd be shrimped without that, right? Without all the driving, and the flying, and the electricity.  Ooh, look! You can see us from space. We win, WE WIN!!
Plankton	Yeah, A to Y. You know, the alphabet.
Plankton	Oh! Oh! Ohhh! It's evil. It's diabolical.  It's lemon-scented. This Plan Z can't  fail!  So enjoy today, Mr. Krabs, because by tomorrow, I'll have the formula. Then everyone will eat at the Chum Bucket, and I will rule the world! All hail Plankton. All hail Plank...!  Ow!
Plankton	[] No, I am not on my way over  to the grand-opening ceremony. I'm busy planning to rule the world!
Plankton	I got it. I got it!
Plankton	Step right up. Plenty for everybody.
Plankton	Bucket helmets for everyone!
Plankton	Evil Plan Z is way ahead of you, baby. I've already hired someone to take care of those two. He's a vicious, cold-blooded predator!
Plankton	We'll see about that, Inspector Looselips.
Plankton	Yeah.
Plankton	Bullseye!
Plankton	It's gonna take a lot more than potatoes to bring this baby down!  Or maybe not.
Plankton	Mayo?! Well, it's gonna take a lot more than mayo to stop-
Plankton	Well, Krabs, I guess you've won. I've spent every penny I've ever made trying to put you out of business...  ...except this one: my last penny.  Besides, what could I do with one measly cent, anyway?
Plankton	Never mind. Maintain radio silence.  He-he, finally!  A pressure plate, eh, Krabs? Amateur hour.  Hmm...  Perfect.  Not a bad likeness.  Good enough to fool that idiot Krabs. Easy, easy.
Plankton	Wait a minute... Molecular deconstruction? I proved that to be a scientific impossibility 7 times!
Plankton	W-What are you gonna do, Krabs? Pour hot oil on me? Or put bamboo shoots under my nails?
Plankton	Jimmy who?
Plankton	Oh, thank you, Squidward!
Plankton	Not now, Hun! I'm ranting/raving.  All right, what is it?
Plankton	I told you, Krabs! I don't have it!
Plankton	Hmm... Get the secret formula, you say? Excuse me, I...need a moment. With that formula, I could rule the world!
Plankton	Te-amwork.
Plankton	Team.
Plankton	Hands in the middle? No, no, sounds idiotic. Besides, the two of us are no match for that cranky mob.  We could probably use a few more... te-am-works.
Plankton	I don't know, SpongeBob.  What exactly does this clown bring to the te-am?
Plankton	Revolting!
Plankton	We better get out of here until things cool off.
Plankton	Don't worry, SpongeBob. We'll find the secret formula and everything will go back to the way it was. You know, all happy and junk.  Now let's try and get some sleep.
Plankton	Good night, indeed.  That's right SpongeBob, sleep. You're hiding that formula in there somewhere.  Huh?  Well, here goes nothing.  Huh? What... is this place?
Plankton	I'm sure it was nothing.  Now, go back to sleep.
Plankton	What do you think I was doing? Looking for the secret formula.
Plankton	Whatever.
Plankton	All right, you can put me down  Well,  that's one minute of my life I'll never get back.
Plankton	Hmm. Yes.  SpongeBob, you're a genius!
Plankton	Hmm.  There she is, my computer wife. They've got her tied up in the back room. I've never seen this many people at The Chum Bucket.
Plankton	Hmm.
Plankton	Ya there?
Plankton	There's a guard over there, camera pans to show Patrick sleeping on a chair]  [Plankton sneaks over while mildly loud notes are played, Patrick yawns while changing his sleeping position. The notes are heard again, then the scene shows SpongeBob playing a tiny piano]  [whispering]
Plankton	Stop. Stop. Stop!  Let me get up there.  Help me.
Plankton	Eh, I never had it, but we're going to get it. We're gonna go back in time and steal the formula before it disappeared.
Plankton	Uh, I need it for the time machine.
Plankton	Whatever.
Plankton	According to my calculations, the Krusty Krab should be right here.
Plankton	What are you doing?
Plankton	No, this doesn't seem right. Should we call Bubbles?
Plankton	We only came back from the day after tomorrow, dim wit.
Plankton	Something moronic?
Plankton	Come on!
Plankton	You're the one who stole the wrong secret formula.
Plankton	YOU ARE THE WORST TEAMMATE EVER!!
Plankton	Where do you think  going?
Plankton	Everything works out.
Plankton	Well, here it is, the Krusty Krab. The reasons of my nightmare and despair. Yep, it's SpongeBob SquareHead, my least favorite idiot.  Yuck.  Blecch, it's that squiddy thing with the tentacles. That guy creeps me out. Will you look at those 2 loafers? Disgusting. I tell you,  I never been to the Krusty Krab,  Open 24 hours a day, 7 days or weeks for the holidays in during disasters.  Krabs! Ugh, how I hate you! I bet he never hears me and I get the peace of my mind, brother. And I'd throw my mind into my brain so he can't see, and I'd get the Krabby Patty Formula for sure. He keeps it in the safe, you know. Show us the safe!   Yeah, they won't show you that. that's a big secret.
Plankton	A pink shark? Oh, it's Patrick, the idiot best friend with that idiot SpongeBob who works with that idiot Krabs from the idiot Krusty Krab with that idiot safe... And the idiot secret formula waiting for idiot me to  Wait, that didn't come out right.
Plankton	Well well well, it was only a matter of time, here comes the hippies.  The nerve of that sponge dragging the poor seaweed under the ground. doesn't he know there's algae living in there? Some of my best friends are algae.
Plankton	Om, I wish they'd show the Krabby Patty again, om..
Plankton	I've never seen that weirdo before in my life, what's his story? All I know is another idiot is getting more screen time me.
Plankton	IT'S THE FLYING DUTCHMAN!!! Ooh, Krabs is gonna get it now, HAHAHAHAHA, Love it.
Plankton	Wow, I didn't see that coming. Neither did he.
Plankton	Hey, what happened? What did I miss? I thought everyone was in peril! WHAT A CHIP!!!  Everybody's happy? Everybody's dancing? Everybody is there but me! How come I never get invited to these things? The invitation probably got lost in the mail-- You know, you try to turn everybody in the town into zombie slaves a couple of times, and they never let it go. This proves my scientific theory is correct, and that theory is, Anybody who's not me,  That one's for free, no charge. I'm gonna go smash some atoms, that'll cheer me up.
Plankton	As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking.  You work for me now, SpongeBob!  Time to put on the official Chum Bucket bucket helmet.
Plankton	Ok, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty!
Plankton	Will you be quiet? I'm thinking! I've got it! To get to the SpongeBob, I'll show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give me what I want.
Plankton	Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?
Plankton	How's this, SpongeBob?
Plankton	Just a few more steps, SpongeBob. Ok, go ahead, take it off!  It's an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen!
Plankton	You ready to make some patties?
Plankton	Me too. You know what would really hit the spot? Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?
Plankton	I command you to make me a patty this instant!
Plankton	What? What!?
Plankton	Oh, please, have mercy, Krabs! I'll do anything! I beg of you!
Plankton	[first lines] Hear me Krabs. When I discover your formula for Krabby Patties, I'll run you out of business. I went to college!  Hey! Let me go!
Plankton	I just want to talk. You could say we're friends, right?
Plankton	You see? Everything works out. I have something for you. I've been keeping it in my secret compartment.  Ding!  Sparkle, sparkle.
Plankton	Gee, and I thought you were stupid.
Plankton	It should be in here... but where?  Where? Oh...  This will be the beginning of the end!  Ouch! Stupid brain...  Come back here you swine!  That's it brain, you're going down!  Yes, yes, that's grand.  And now, for my very elaborate and college-educated plan.  And now it's time for a little wakey-uppy.
Plankton	You pretentious little insignificant artist. Your snivelly creations are worth less than a protozoan's waste!
Plankton	You are going to hand-deliver it to me personally!
Plankton	Impressed? Now let's reveal that secret formula.  And this little piggy brought home a Krabby Patty.  This little piggy will help me drop it in. Any last words, SpongeBob SecretPants?
Plankton	Yes... yes... YES!  Come to papa!  Oh boy...
Plankton	Then become part of the greatest musical sensation to ever hit Bikini Bottom.
Plankton	Correct!
Plankton	I love messing things up.
Plankton	...your carapace!
Plankton	Other way!  Imbeciles.
Plankton	Too late! Ready or not, here he comes. Quake with fear, you mortal fools. Bow down before the awesome might of...
Plankton	He's not really your friend.
Plankton	Then get mean!
Plankton	Win this one because I told you to.
Plankton	Now get up there and show him how the common man prepares his frozen dairy treats!
Plankton	Ooh!  You're all mine you sweet Krabby Patty. Ooh hoo-hoo-hoo! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!  Initiating launch sequence.  Krabby Patty, here I come!
Plankton	Oh, can it, computer wife. Can't you see I'm exhausted? Why don't you go make yourself useful and synthesize me up some grub?
Plankton	At last!
Plankton	Why- why not?
Plankton	Review?
Plankton	I thought I sent you away, Cretin.
Plankton	What?
Plankton	Uh, sure kid, you're uh... you're on register now.
Plankton	So what do you want me to do about it?
Plankton	Just tell Daddy what you want! Oof! He's very busy!
Plankton	Me?
Plankton	Oh, what now?
Plankton	Who's back? What?  What was that?
Plankton	Krabs? What the barnacle is going on here?
Plankton	I don't understand. Is there a gas leak in here?
Plankton	What's this? Drops of rain frozen into ice crystals? I shall harness their energy and rule the world!  Ahh... oh, stop! I wish to rule you!
Plankton	But, but that's my chum-fueled antennae massager!
Plankton	Secret recipe, you say, huh?  What's in it?
Plankton	Ha-ha-ha! That's right, Krabs! Now, we have a secret formula, and it's in a bottle, and you can't have it! Ha-ha!
Plankton	That's right, Plankton! My robotic Patrick has lured you and that delicious patty into my fiendish hands! Now hand it over!
Plankton	Here comes the paddle ball! I've got you right where I want you!
Plankton	Oh, what a beautiful sight! Weapons as far as the eye can see. But which one will be right for me? How do I pick? Which one will do the trick? Which is best to guarantee eternal rest? So many weapons! How do I choose? Look at this one with a beautiful fuse! And with this one I couldn't lose. That one will surely give them the blues... And this one here matches my shoes!  Come on, Plankton, just pick one and forget about your shoes! Eeny, meeny, minie moe, I pick you, now let's go!
Sandy	This song's got a great beat.
Sandy	Does this outfit make me look fat?
Sandy	Well, I guess it's up to me!  I'll sneak over...unseen...and catch them by surprise.  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!  Boom!
Sandy	See, that's why you must always pay attention to the mountain.
Sandy	Don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?
Sandy	Hey, SpongeBob, ready to go sandboarding again? SpongeBob?
Sandy	Just sitting in your house? Ain't you gonna get lonesome?
Sandy	SpongeBob, sooner or later you're gonna have to go outside!
Sandy	We've got to try something else!
Sandy	Trampoline!
Sandy	Clam wrestling!
Sandy	Wha...will you get out of here?
Sandy	No, really! You've got to come and save me!
Sandy	Ah! A real gorilla!
Sandy	I knew it was you guys! Alright, joke's over. Take off the sheets.  It is ghosts!
Sandy	Oh, it's easy if you approach it scientifically, SpongeBob. Now, what is laughter?
Sandy	You're in the hospital, silly. You broke your laugh box.
Sandy	I love my new job.
Sandy	Well, this here is my new matter transporter. It can move things from one place to another in the blink of an eye.
Sandy	I always did want to try a critter. Sure, why not? Get in there, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Well, I wish I knew how.
Sandy	Well, that's a darn shame. You know what, I was working on the blueprints for a new invention. But it's still in the embryonic stage.
Sandy	Uhh, well, I'm not quite done with it yet.
Sandy	Whoo-wee, there you boys are. Looks like I'm just in time.
Sandy	They're coming. They're coming. The chimps are coming.
Sandy	There's my nuttaccino machine. It makes a hot, frothy cup of any nut you choose.  And lastly, my fully automated nutcracker.  Oh, I can't even make a simple nutcracker!
Sandy	Will this bus take you somewhere when you've got nowhere else to go?
Sandy	I was about to be fired anyway. Thanks for trying to help, SpongeBob. You, too, Patrick.
Sandy	I accept.
Sandy	Karate Island? I've never heard of Karate Island.
Sandy	Yup. That's it over there.
Sandy	Oh, brother.
Sandy	All right, Udon, I'm on to you. This is as crooked as a dizzy sidewinder.
Sandy	I'm getting off this crazy train!
Sandy	Hold on, buddy!
Sandy	Taste these!
Sandy	Advanced hair-dryer style!
Sandy	Release SpongeBob.
Sandy	I won't give in to your timeshare vacation scam!
Sandy	You are in my book, SpongeBob. You are in my book. Now let me tell you about real estate. It's all about location...
Sandy	That wishing well sure does work.
Sandy	I never got a chance to talk to SpongeBob yesterday. I was laughing too hard.  SpongeBob? Huh?
Sandy	Neither can I, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Now do you see what I'm saying, SpongeBob?
Sandy	You did the right thing, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Now is my chance to try out my new invention-- The solution to your problem.
Sandy	Completely! As long as someone competent is behind the wheel. Hey, what's that?  Hi-yah! Sweet dreams, partner. Oops! I forgot to pack food for the trip. I've got to get some supplies from my treedome, and I need you to guard the submarine while I'm gone.  Do you think you can handle it, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Hi, Squidward.  Well, the submarine is safely inside you.
Sandy	SpongeBob, Patrick, can you hear me?
Sandy	Let's get you out of there, SpongeBob. All you need to do is locate the autopilot. It'll safely take you through your mission and then out the extraction point.
Sandy	Don't worry, it's temporary. Now, just sign this!
Sandy	They're hitting your central nervous system!
Sandy	The stomach acid levels are way too high!
Sandy	If you can make a big enough burp...
Sandy	Now burp, Squidward! Lives are on the line!
Sandy	Good work, guys. Mission accomplished.  Now all you have to do is...
Sandy	Knock... it... off.  It stopped? SpongeBob!
Sandy	What in tarnation?  Oh my gosh. SpongeBob? SpongeBob?  SpongeBob, open up.
Sandy	Well, your old pal, Sandy knows how to cut you down.
Sandy	I'm okay.
Sandy	It's a rocket ship, duh! I'll meet you downstairs and show you around.
Sandy	I need that drawer.
Sandy	All right. Y'all can ride in the cargo hold if you just...
Sandy	Aliens? Are you nuts? I've been to the moon, there are no aliens.
Sandy	Sometimes that SpongeBob is as dumb as a sack of peanuts.
Sandy	Hiya! Hey, SpongeBob, want to do some karaaaaaa...!
Sandy	Cameras that fit up your nose, high-powered magnifying glasses, and my favorite, the knockout ray.
Sandy	Hi-yah!  Hey, SpongeBob, you didn't forget about our plan to go a-choppin', did you?
Sandy	What a schnook.
Sandy	Well, something's making my skin crawl.
Sandy	Aww, guys, you shouldn't have.  A new itch board? I mean, a new snowboard? Boy, I sure can't wait to scratch this down chafe mountain.
Sandy	Creepin' critters, feels like somethin's bitin' me.  I've got a flea? Well, I ain't gonna take that without a fight.  Hi...yah!  I'll get ya.  SpongeBob, my suitcase. Hurry.  I'm ashamed to say this, SpongeBob, but while I was in Texas, I seem to have picked up a flea.
Sandy	'Cause he's hungry. When a flea bites you, it's 'cause he's sucking up your blood for nutrition.
Sandy	I need this.
Sandy	Hey!  Y'all got the aim of a cross-eyed armadilla.  Run again!
Sandy	Them varmints is tough. They're from Texas, phew!
Sandy	SpongeBob! That's It. Water!
Sandy	I'll give him a week.
Sandy	The Amulet of Atlantis?! Legend says, that when the two halves are joined, the path to Atlantis is opened! What are y'all waitin' for? Let's hitch them two dogies up! Go on Squidward!
Sandy	You know, LRH, I was born with a scientific curiosity and I was wonderin' if I could have a look at some of your scientific achievements?
Sandy	How's it work?
Sandy	They are just amazing! I used your invention room to make this!
Sandy	Maybe, if y'all use your feet!
Sandy	But Atlantis had that science stuff at which I was a whiz!
Sandy	Please don't make us leave!
Sandy	A fight? Well, there's no shame in losing.
Sandy	Jack M. Crazyfish?
Sandy	What the?  Whoa there! Calm down! Tell me what happened.
Sandy	Aahh, let's get you back home you little fella!  There you go!
Sandy	No way guys! This is a serious trip for hard-core survivalists only!
Sandy	It was no accident that you fell out of my truck, I was just testing your survival skills.
Sandy	Uh-oh! Next time I'll bring more granola!
Sandy	I sure do! My great aunt Rosie Cheeks was the first squirrel to discover oil. At Spindletop, Texas.
Sandy	"""Family Histories of Bikini Bottom"". Let's see, SquareHead, SquareShirt, SquarePants, Hey, looky here!"
Sandy	Back in them days, the whole place was run by that no-good gloot, Dead Eye!
Sandy	HUH?
Sandy	It's all done! My greatest invention yet!
Sandy	Patrick, where's SpongeBob?
Sandy	Gary? Gary?
Sandy	Squidward! Mr. Krabs! Y'all seen SpongeBob?
Sandy	Listen up, y'all! I got a plan to bring back SpongeBob.
Sandy	SpongeBob!
Sandy	There he is, guys!
Sandy	Now let's see what that little critter's up to.  New mayor of...  SpongeBob's mayor of New Kelp City!
Sandy	Well, I'm sorry I yelled at you, buddy.
Sandy	You must've lost your memory when you hit your head. You'll just have to come back with us to Bikini Bottom. The familiar surroundings will bring your memory right back.
Sandy	Here it is! You must recognize this place.
Sandy	It's great to have you back, Spongy.
Sandy	Uh oh.  Yall... darn it!
Sandy	Let's hogtie him and run him out of town on a rail.
Sandy	What exactly are you getting at, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Sorry, fellars, this is a private treedome.
Sandy	Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-
Sandy	Y'all be careful! Looks like some big waves a-comin'!
Sandy	Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Sandy	This weather sure is dangerous! I better be careful!  May Day! May Day! I'm goin' down!! Repeat: Down!!!
Sandy	Shucks. Now I'll never find SpongeBob and Patrick.
Sandy	Howdy, SpongeBob. How's it goin'?
Sandy	That is, if you want arms like these.  Or these!  Or these!
Sandy	Alright, put 'em up!
Sandy	This is it.
Sandy	Pardon me.
Sandy	Your secret workout. What is it?
Sandy	The big Mussel Beach anchor tossing competition. It's today! Everybody'll be there!
Sandy	Here it is-- the sign-in list.
Sandy	SpongeBob SquarePants.
Sandy	Beat that, SpongeBob!
Sandy	I think we finally found an exercise for you, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Not even for a game of badminton with me and Dale here?
Sandy	Well, howdy, stranger! I don't recognize you in those newfangled dungarees.  You must be SpongeBob FancyPants. Clothes really do make the man!
Sandy	Hey, listen, I was wondering if you could come by tonight.
Sandy	Just be here!
Sandy	SpongeBob?
Sandy	Some of you may be wondering why the test subject is disrobing. It is because...  What's under your gown?
Sandy	Without further delay, I will now initiate the protosequence.
Sandy	Aw, you overextended yourself.
Sandy	Sandy Cheeks here.  So, it was  you who stole my other radio, Squidward!
Sandy	Why, thanks SpongeBob. I sure am obliged. I love these things, but it's always a little tricky eating one. Pardon me.
Sandy	Whew! Boy, that's ripe.
Sandy	Mm-mmm! Nothing like a hot shower to make a squirrel feel like a new woman!
Sandy	What in tarnation!?
Sandy	Some low-life varmint stole my things and broke into my home! ! I'm gonna get that son of a guitar stringer!
Sandy	Chipmunk?! What is so funny about havin' my fur stole?
Sandy	That dastardly rustler's got to be somewhere in these parts.
Sandy	I better go underground.
Sandy	Unhand my pelt, you unknown varmint!
Sandy	Pwaaaaa!
Sandy	Cops! Thank goodness you've come.  Take this sicko away!
Sandy	What you need is a mediator. Y'all bet to sit down and work this out. Now the main problem in an argument is a lack of communication. You can only resolve conflict when you understand each other.  So I want each of you to state what is most important to the each of you right now.
Sandy	SpongeBob?
Sandy	Do you mind?
Sandy	No.
Sandy	Critters that you gotta wrangle.  Cowboy suits with perty spangles.  Boots with spurs that jingle jangle, that's a rodeo. Tight blue jeans you gotta squeeze in, but they sure look mighty pleasin'!  Big belt buckles are always in season!  That's a rodeo.
Sandy	Rodeo
Sandy	Rodeo!
Sandy	And dont forget who makes us laugh when were feelin down. The happy slappy, sunny, funny good ol rodeo clown.
Sandy	Huh?
Sandy	Aw, cactus! That ol bullfrogs got SpongeBob! Hang on, old buddy!  Next time, leave the rodeos to me.
Sandy	But this is an emergency! SpongeBob? Pleeaase?!
Sandy	Brainless?
Sandy	Golly! We've got to get this varmint off of you. Now, turn around...  and grab something heavy.  Now hold still.
Sandy	I think it's high time we got rid of this critter.
Sandy	Come on, Pat! We need your help!
Sandy	"Just as I thought. You're suffering from a condition known as ""Earworm."" You see, when your brain becomes stuck on a catchy tune, you're spectable with earworm infection and you've got a nasty one there."
Sandy	Oh, right. Squidward. You play that little doohickey.
Sandy	Oh, that's terrible news.
Sandy	Be careful!
Sandy	What's your mom's maiden name?
Sandy	Yes!  I need a sample of their slime! If I can analyze it, I might be deduce the cause of their behavior! And maybe we can stop them!
Sandy	No, I'll go! The whelks don't seem to be after land critters!
Sandy	Me too!
Sandy	I'm gonna get you tomorrow, SpongeBob!
Sandy	No it's not, SpongeBob.  This is!  Now, prepare for a long, merciless whooping!  Mmmm, my favorite.
Sandy	Hi-yah!
Sandy	Huh?
Sandy	We can find something to do that's almost nine times as fun.
Sandy	Yeah, you can say that again.
Sandy	Karate?
Sandy	One. Just one.
Sandy	Maybe just one more. Uhh, I'm kinda hungry.
Sandy	Thanks. Hi-yah!  Is that enough?
Sandy	Right!
Sandy	And, what else should we slice?
Sandy	I love karate!
Sandy	SpongeBob!
Sandy	Aw, nuts!
Sandy	I guess I never realized you were such a student of science. Maybe you could help me fix my nut transporter.
Sandy	Thanks, SpongeBob!
Sandy	Uh huh. Or I could combine your gasifier with my invention and gasify my nuts that transports them to Texas!
Sandy	Ready!
Sandy	Just a few more adjustments...
Sandy	Test 3!
Sandy	One!
Sandy	Aw, I knew Plankton was hatching an evil plan the whole time. So I just adjusted the controls to where he can't do any harm. Nobody fools a squirrel from Texas!
Sandy	Sandy.  So what do y'all call yourself?
Sandy	Why, that's my air helmet.
Sandy	Shee-oot. How about coming over tomorrow for tea and cookies then?  Don't be late!
Sandy	Course there's no water. Nuttin' but air.
Sandy	For me? How sweet!  You okay?
Sandy	I'm gonna to put these in a vase.
Sandy	Come and get it! Y'all gonna like this...
Sandy	Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target.
Sandy	Not a Parakeet! Para-  medic...
Sandy	Don't worry, he won't!  I will.  Yeeha!
Sandy	Ha! Slimeless snow vermin! You missed!
Sandy	Woo, wee! That was a close one, wasn't it, Mr. Krabs? Huh?  Of all the horn swabbles! The banit's trying to win us out so he can get the prize himself!
Sandy	Oh! Well, let's drop EVERYTHING, then!
Sandy	Naw, silly! I'm saying, Plankton set up a robotic dummy in his sled!
Sandy	Hold on, SpongeBob!
Sandy	Look, fellas, I know it's cold. But let's just push forward and keep a lookout for a frozen crab!
Sandy	He doesn't look so good. We better get him to the sleigh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob? SpongeBob! He froze up too.
Sandy	She's all fired up!
Sandy	No, eat me!
Sandy	Everyone will look so silly, you won't even remember you're nervous! Which is why I invented these.  Goggles that let you see people in your undies. Or, I could just make you a fake boating license.
Sandy	"""Please come by my house tonight. I'm having a science fair!"" Oh SpongeBob this sounds plumb good to be true!"""
Sandy	Yes, SpongeBob?
Sandy	What do you think of my moon wagon?
Sandy	Yep! I'm all packed up and ready to go. Wanna help me
Sandy	Nevermind. Can't stop the countdown now. Better strap yourself down. Looks like you're going on a mooncation!
Sandy	You can't bring regular food into space!
Sandy	Well, it's a good thing I've brought my special space suit designed for just this kind of situation! Now, try not to file anything else up while I'm saving our necks.  Aha! There's our problem.  Eh, could've used more nuts.  Okay. I've got her up and running, again. Now, can you please sit with your hands folded for a while, SpongeBob?
Sandy	That looks like a good spot.  Alright, SpongeBob. Now that our camp is set up, it's time for some moon crater boarding!
Sandy	Uh oh! Looks like SpongeBob's too light for lunar gravity. SpongeBob, grab a hold of this!
Sandy	Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get while there's still enough fuel to make it home!
Sandy	'm going to take this bull by the horns!
Sandy	Ruined? Oh heck no! That was the most fun I've had in a toad's age! Once I get my rocket fixed, you and me is heading to Mars. Now, let's go grab another one of them sheet cakes.
Sandy	Hiya, Patrick.
Sandy	Hello, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Uh-huh. Yeah. Since when does your house have feet?
Sandy	I'm taking you to the doctor right now.
Sandy	Now look what you've done, Patrick!
Sandy	I'll catch your ghosts for ya! It'll be easy with my new fangled critter-detector-catcher gizmo!
Sandy	This place looks like it hasn't been lived in for years.
Sandy	The Flying Dutchman?! You ain't afraid he's gonna want it back?
Sandy	Got ya, you little gremlin!
Sandy	Yep. I brought home something real handy.
Sandy	That's right boys. I wanted you to destroy my home all along so I can test this out this here rubble reverse ray blaster on some genuine rubble. I could've just smashed all this stuff up myself, but nobody destroys stuff up quite like y'all. You're not a failure SpongeBob, you're a scientist. (SpongeBob and Patrick laughing)
Sandy	Smarter, huh? Well, I'd love to try out your new-fangled bubbles, Patrick, but I've got to fix these air lines to my treedome. They're all clogged up and the lack of fresh air is making me woozy.
Sandy	Oh, no! I have only a few minutes of air left! I'm far too dizzy already. You'll have to drive, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Gimme that wheel, SquareButt. I know a shortcut.
Sandy	Yeah, yeah. Right after I grab a quick bit at the Krusty Krab. Yee-haw.
Sandy	I'm alive? And the treedome's full of air? And sort of dry? How'd you fellers pull it off?
Sandy	He just doesn't know karate, he IS karate.  He is the legendary karate master, Fuzzy Acorns. Fuzzy is here to test me for the highest belt in karate.
Sandy	Better run on home and practice SpongeBob! See you tomorrow!
Sandy	Huh?
Sandy	That was pretty low-down, Fuzzy. The way you humiliated my friend.
Sandy	You sure you don't need an air helmet?
Sandy	Now you're convinced!
Sandy	That's showing him, SpongeBob!  You gonna give him a belt Fuzzy? Or have you not had enough yet?
Sandy	I know what he needs! He just needs this!
Sandy	Come on in then.
Sandy	Okay, well was there something particular you wanted to see?
Sandy	Mmmm, chocolate. Mighty tasty. Patrick's gonna love the one you made for him.  Take me through the plan again.
Sandy	You are such a kidder, Sandy out. That SpongeBob...  Scallops...chocolate-eating scallops!
Sandy	Sandy to SpongeBob, I got my ox in a ditch here! I'm way off course! The scallops are eating the balloon! They're everywhere!  Aw, shoot! We're going down, SpongeBob! Switch to plan B!
Sandy	Alright, you rotten jelly clone! What have you done with SpongeBob?!
Sandy	Ew, I don't like mayonnaise neither.
Sandy	Greetings fellow Clone. I hate mayonnaise.
Sandy	It worked SpongeBob! Keep going!
Sandy	Let 'er rip!
Sandy	Cheeks residence
Sandy	That sure don't sound like nothing. What's all the ruckus?
Sandy	Well, I'm with you SpongeBob. And I've got the toolbox to prove it!
Sandy	Well of course we do silly. Firstly, every pineapple needs a solid foundation to keep it firmly in place...
Sandy	Well, this ain't the TV room, anymore. This is your indoor garden.
Sandy	Sorry, buddy. I-I can't understand you. You've got something in your mouth.
Sandy	Yee-haw!
Sandy	Hmmmm, this may get tricky. Y'all need to relax them facial muscles, what y'all need is a massage.
Sandy	Oh, Christmas, oh, Christmas is sweet mystery. I'll mix a dash of Christmas cheer with a candy cane and deconstructed alchemy.
Sandy	Problem? My only problem is I'm out of fruitcake. Only thing I've got left to eat are boring old nuts.
Sandy	You took food from Plankton and fed it to everyone in town?
Sandy	Hmm  You don't act jerky. For some reason it's not affecting you. It must be a combination of your tiny brain and pure heart. You're immune to Jerktonium, SpongeBob, but the rest of us will need an antidote. I'll set the analyzer to calculate the formula.  Why, this formula for the antidote don't make no sense at all!
Sandy	Yes siree! I swear by the power of Texas, I'm gonna break all the records in this here book!
Sandy	...108, 109, 110!
Sandy	Chum, huh? That's not too bad.
Sandy	Uh, SpongeBob, I changed my mummh...  MUST MAKE WORLD RECORD!
Sandy	Well, hurry up! I got record breaking to do!
Sandy	Thanks for all your help, cousins!  See you all next Christmas! Bye!
Sandy	Outstanding! Here, hold this.  How'd i do?
Sandy	What's next?
Sandy	Next!
Sandy	What?
Sandy	Come on, you don't need your helmet. This one's outside! Follow me.
Sandy	What's next?
Sandy	What's wrong with you?
Sandy	Oh, don't be silly, SpongeBob. I'm done with that book! I've beat every record in here. In fact, I've been finding the author who verified my evidence.
Sandy	Woah, oh, oh! Karate ain't for revenge. It's a delicate art that helps you protect yourself!
Sandy	Okay then! Let's get started with a little choppin'! Like so. HIYAH!
Sandy	Now that's how you do it!
Sandy	He's going to use my teachings for revenge SpongeBob.
Sandy	Alright! I reckon that yard is good and watered!
Sandy	Ye-HAAA! I told y'all had to do is know the movements of everyday to master karate!
Sandy	After all I'd said about never using karate for revenge.
Sandy	O-kay...  My scientific investigation has  revealed that deep beneath the lagoon floor is a volcanic pocket of super goo.  A crack has formed releasing bubbles of the goo to the surface which are toxic and very unstable. At any moment, it could lose its integrity and boom! It'll explode!
Sandy	You have been warned!
Sandy	Well, Perch, I won't really know anything until I run some tests but I can tell you it's pretty serious. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get going.
Sandy	Come on, guys. We still have more tests to perform. I need a sample. Be a darling and hand me that there bucket.  Ok, SpongeBob, put a little bit of that gloop into this analyzer.  This is worse than I thought.
Sandy	Well, Perch, it's my considered opinion that now would be a good time to--  --run like heck!
Sandy	Hold on, Patrick! We're here to rescue you!
Sandy	You know, in case I get stuck in traffic. Here goes!  Darn it!  Huh? What the--?
Sandy	Dang it! We'll never catch him at this rate!
Sandy	We've got you surrounded, Plankton! Now, come out with your antenna in the air!
Sandy	Thank Neptune for the Barg'N-Mart buck discount!
Sandy	SpongeBob, don't you want your water helmet?
Sandy	We are both mammals, but that is where the similarities end. Cats are no good scoundrels and I ain't never trusting one of them!
Sandy	Just out ofscientific curiosity, how do you hold your breath for so long?
Sandy	I knew Kenny was a fake!
Sandy	Can't you see? It's Texas.
Sandy	Aww, SpongeBob, I'm not feeling up to karate now.
Sandy	I ain't crying! My helmet just sprung a leak!
Sandy	Go away.
Sandy	Hey SpongeBob. Hey Patrick.
Sandy	I'm tired of fish food, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Don't you  take the name of Texas in vain!
Sandy	I'm warnin' you, SpongeBob!
Sandy	Hi-yah!  Y'all gonna take back what ya said!
Sandy	For me?!
Sandy	I'm staying!
Sandy	Very interesting.  Okay, next.  SpongeBob! I almost didn't recognize you.  You look awful! What are you doin' with these here freeloaders?
Sandy	SpongeBob, you're a mess. You're falling apart.  Come on now, SpongeBob. You need to pull yourself together. Get some structure in your life.  What you need is a new job.
Sandy	If you want to invent a game, you should study all the games you like and figure out what it is you liked best about them.  Then you can use those elements in the game you invent.
Sandy	What's it called, Patrick?
Sandy	Hmm... Remove finbone from player to your left.
Sandy	Don't go, Squidward!
Sandy	Nice play, Squidward!
Sandy	That-a-boy! I got you a ticket just in case!
Sandy	Sandy Cheeks. Day one of behavioral study of subjects in Bikini Bottom. Initiating observations,  now!
Sandy	Emotional state seems to be rising in anger. Eyebrows are now considerably burrowed.
Sandy	Eureka!
Sandy	It's easy. I observe you while you two act normal.
Sandy	Yes, yes. You both get an A+.
Sandy	When a subject is aware of being observed, it can affect his or her actions and create inaccurate data. Hmm...
Sandy	It's a guaranteed A+.
Sandy	Then off you go.
Sandy	Ok, team. For this experiment, I need you to count the grains of sand in each bucket. Then tell me if there are more black grains or more white grains. Or is it the same amount. Alright then. I have to run some errands, but I'll be back later.
Sandy	Time to initiate the first variable. One big bowl. One small bowl. Exactly eight ounces per bowl.  Free ice cream! Free ice cream! One day only! Get your free ice cream!
Sandy	Okie dokie!
Sandy	Here ya go!
Sandy	Sandy to Gary! Sandy to Gary! How serious is the situation?
Sandy	It's me! Sandy!
Sandy	Everybody gets an A+ and ice cream!
Sandy	This old thing? It's just something I threw on.
Sandy	Yeah, I know. But when you do it all the the thumbs-up loses its meaning. It becomes not special.
Sandy	Come now, it can't be that bad!
Sandy	Don't give up! Something to live for!
Sandy	Hey!
Sandy	It ain't autumn!   Oh, my tree is dying!
Sandy	Ah, growth pills.  Hi!  Nuts.  Ah-ha!  Yee-haw!
Sandy	I love squirreling away nuts, but this is just too much!
Sandy	Shertainly not! I mean certainly not!  Let's see what we can cook up. Aged Nut Brie. Ghost Nut Chili. How 'bout Nutty Butter? Seems easy enough to make.
Sandy	Hmm. Why don't you boys take some for the road?
Sandy	Patrick, what's going on here?
Sandy	Well, I don't want to let anyone down. I can make some more acorns!
Sandy	SpongeBob, here, scoops acorns onto my conveyor belt.  Then the tubes take them inside  where I turn them into Nutty Butter.
Sandy	Please, please no pushing! I'll make more! Remember, Sandy's the squirrel you can count on!
Sandy	Wait, you're the one who said I should feed my nuts to the people?
Sandy	What can I do ya for, SquarePants?
Sandy	What's got your behind a-buzzin'?
Sandy	Sure.
Sandy	Alright, SpongeBob. I tied ya up to a rope so you won't be able to go too far off course.
Sandy	Get outta here, Steve!
Sandy	Hmm?  Plankton, you look like the cheese that fell off the cracker. I bet you tried to get that formula again.
Sandy	What happened to your head, SpongeBob?
Sandy	What in Sam Hill?
Sandy	Zero as being everyone's collected by goo.
Sandy	Nuts?
Sandy	No things!
Sandy	Aww! This isn't working!
Sandy	And don't forget your last homework assignment!
Sandy	Excellent, Mr. Krabs!  Here's your final grade for acting class. A+.  I've really felt the fear.
Sandy	And it looks like you're not the only critters around these parks to lose your minds.  Hmm... And my detector is leading us directly to that house.
Sandy	This place has a ten-gallon case of the creepies. I wonder what's in...
Sandy	Alright! Now you listen to me, you twisted coot! You can't steal somebody's brain just because it flies into your yard! That's brain-napping! And it looks like I'll be the one callin' the police!
Sandy	I think I'm thinkin' what you're thinkin'.
Sandy	"That is me to a Texas ""T,"" SpongeBob! He nailed you too, Plankton!"
Sandy	Huh! Oh.
Sandy	Hi, SpongeBob. We need to talk.
Sandy	There he is!
Sandy	Okay, guys, SpongeBob imitates whoever he hears, so we've all got to imitate him to help him remember who he is.  This should help!
Sandy	It's not working, fellers! We need to combine our efforts and do an impression of SpongeBob all at the same time! Okay, all together now!
Sandy	Sandy Cheeks here documenting our big road trip. Let's go see what everyone's doing.  How's the trip so far?
Sandy	OK. So are we ready a little karate? Huh, big guy? Can you handle this? Do you think you're ready to witness these skills,  this footwork?  Is too fast for ya?  Too inventive? I just wanna warn you so far and get pretty physical. OK. Now show me your skills. Come on now, don't be shy. Let's see the old one-two!
Sandy	SpongeBob, went south for the winter. Love, Sandy.
Sandy	Behold! The uncharted caverns of Lameria. Now remember, SpongeBob, this place is filled with delicate artifacts, don't touch anything.
Sandy	Then that means...  Oh, boy.
Sandy	SpongeBob, no!  Look out!
Sandy	I didn't realize the Lamerians were a race of robots.
Sandy	Hey, Larry.
Sandy	Ain't he the funniest little Sponge you ever saw?
Sandy	SpongeBob!
Sandy	Your song is true. If y'all want to be my friend, just be yourself.
Sandy	And this here's Snakey.
Sandy	Shoot! Looks like a twister hit this place. Where is everybody?  Oh, hey there Wormy.  You weren't supposed to change till I got back. That oughta hold ya, little guy.  Howdy, SpongeBob.
Sandy	I'll have two Krabby Patties: extra ketchup, extra mustard, and hold the mayo.
Sandy	No more Krabby Patties? If I'd known that, I'd have chewed it slower. Huh?  What the corndog is that?!
Sandy	And I think I figured it out. Look!  When this came down from above, I knew it could only mean one thing.
Sandy	I done figured it out!  We have angered the sandwich gods and only a sacrifice will appease them!
Sandy	Y'all, those aren't porpoises.
Sandy	Hold on!
Sandy	Yeeee...
Sandy	There we go!  SpongeBob, I got all the leaves ra...  SpongeBob, what are all these leaves doing here? You said you were going to rake them!
Sandy	It's when I go to sleep for the whole winter.
Sandy	In one week!
Sandy	We gotta ride!
Sandy	What?!
Sandy	I got to say, I'm impressed with you, SpongeBob. You're making this the best pre-hibernation week ever.
Sandy	Ok SpongeBob, this one's going to be fun. We just whack each other with these giant ear cleaners 'til one of us falls off.  On your mark... get set...
Sandy	What is it?
Sandy	Found it, SpongeBob!  Come on. Best two out of three.
Sandy	Now get movin'!  SpongeBob?  Someone look up there.  Put your doors, and friends into it!  Come on! He could be anywhere in these sulfur fields!
Sandy	Well, look again!
Sandy	That's a good idea! Use the children to crawl into small places you couldn't normally reach.
Sandy	No you ain't!
Sandy	SpongeBob?
Sandy	What in the name of the Alamo is wrong with you, SpongeBob? Ain't you never seen a Christmas tree before?
Sandy	Howdy!  If y'all are watching this, that means I'm asleep for the winter. This sleep is called hibernation.  During hibernation, animals don't like to be woken up. So do not disturb.  That means you, SpongeBob.
Sandy	I'll get you two. You're nothing but pure evil! Just like newspaper comics...
Sandy	I'm gonna rip your arms off and.... flapjacks?
Sandy	You're gonna be wearing an iron lung when I'm through with you, Pinhead!
Sandy	Oh look, it's SpongeBob and Patrick!
Sandy	More lemonade, boys?
Sandy	Huh?
Sandy	Well, ac-actually SpongeBob, n-no. Those jokes are hurtful and you know it.
Sandy	Huh?
Sandy	Hey, uhh, SpongeBob?
Sandy	Y-y-you see? That's what I'm talking about!
Sandy	I haven't heard it! Good one, SpongeBob!
Sandy	Well, hoooow-deeeeeee!
Sandy	Ain't that purdy?
Sandy	Wa...llet? Watch? Waffles?
Sandy	What's that? You want more?  Okey-dokey! More water for the sea-critter!
Sandy	What?
Sandy	Yeah. And sweaty. Besides, I think we'd all know who'd get to the top first.
Sandy	I'd say I'm already halfway there!
Sandy	Too bad you forgot your umbrella!
Sandy	Why don't use ask my behind! That is, if you can catch it! What do you think of that, HydroPants?
Sandy	I thought y'all wanted a rematch.
Sandy	Gulf streamer!
Sandy	That land critters are better than sea critters!
Sandy	Squirrels can do anything they want to!
Sandy	[] Uh...uh...
Sandy	Well, you know...  I don't need to...  Grr... I'll show ya all! I don't need this suit!  And I don't need this helmet neither!
Sandy	All right, all right! You had your little laugh. But now it's my turn! Y'all think you're such hot stuff, don't ya! Swimming around with your fancy gills and such. But none of you wetheads could last a minute on my turf. Dry land!
Sandy	Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes!
Sandy	You know, everyone's best at something.
Sandy	Why, when I find out who caused that oyster so much pain, no more jiggery-pokery!
Sandy	SpongeBob doesn't have hair... or does he?
Sandy	I'll catch your worm for ya, that is, if'n you're willing to pay!
Sandy	Don't worry, SpongeBob. I won't be long.
Sandy	So's Patrick's belly button, but I ain't afraid of that neither!
Sandy	You do? Where?
Sandy	SpongeBob, what is the matter with you? Now, I'm gonna go give that legless rascal what-for, and there ain't nothing you can say to stop me!
Sandy	Ain't no way some dumb old sea worm's gonna make a meal of me. I'm too Texas tough!
Sandy	And who saves your yellow backside from certain destruction on a regular basis?
Sandy	Ain't nothin'!
Sandy	Worm sign.  He's in that cave.
Sandy	Almost done!
Sandy	Pardon?
Sandy	Later!
Sandy	SpongeBob!
Sandy	All right! You were right, and I was wrong. I was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Are you happy now?
Sandy	"No, silly! How about S for ""save our skins""?  Yee-haw! Now this is what I call a rodeo! We'll be nice and safe up here.  We did it!"
Sandy	What did you? For cryin' out. What did y'all do to me?
Sandy	Shee-oot, SpongeBob. How are we gonna go swimmin' when you're in a shirt and tie?
Sandy	Hi-yah!  Look, SpongeBob, we both brought our karate gear.
Sandy	"Back in Texas, we call ice cream ""frozen cow juice"". Excuse me for a sec. Hi-yah!  Thank you."
Sandy	Looks like a rip-snortin' good time, SpongeBob!
Sandy	Thanks. See ya inside, SpongeBob!
Sandy	Okay, SpongeBob, my treedome is a highly technical facility and there are many facets to its operation. SpongeBob, are you getting all this?
Sandy	Now pay attention as I clue you in on some of your more elaborate responsibilities. This majestic structure is my kelp greenhouse. Its functions are complete automated, so all you have to do...
Sandy	This part's easy. All's you gotta do is come in here and count every single one of these robots and make sure none of them's gone missing. You seem to be doing a good job paying attention, SpongeBob.
Sandy	Are you sure?
SpongeBob	Today's the big day, Gary!
SpongeBob	There it is. The finest eating establishment ever established for eating. The Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. With a 'Help Wanted' sign in the window! For years I've been dreaming of this moment! I'm gonna go in there, march straight to the manager, look 'im straight in the eye,  lay it on the line and... I can't do this!  Uh, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Mine were.
SpongeBob	I'm ready!
SpongeBob	I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! Go SpongeBob! Go SpongeBob! Go SpongeBob! Go self!
SpongeBob	Aye aye, captain!  One hydrodynamic spatula, with port-and-starboard attachments, turbo drive, coming right up, Sir!
SpongeBob	Permission to come aboard captain! Da da da da da da da! Da da da da da da da da da da! Did someone order a spatula?  That's right! One hydrodynamic spatula with  port-and-starboard attachments, and lets not forget the turbo drive!  Would you believe they only had one in stock? To the kitchen!  Who's hungry?!
SpongeBob	I can't. I'm still in Boating School.
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse.
SpongeBob	And you know what else else? I think the pizzas getting cold.
SpongeBob	Its an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once.
SpongeBob	The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza free delivery. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty.
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	Yep.
SpongeBob	I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral.  No, maybe it wasn't coral.  Maybe it was sand, no, no, mud.
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	Wait a second, I know what you're trying to do, Squidward. I'm not letting you eat the pizza!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	No! No!
SpongeBob	Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved!  Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, we are saved!
SpongeBob	Congratulations, sir. Your Krabby Patty pizza is here!
SpongeBob	But... but...
SpongeBob	Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work.
SpongeBob	POOP?
SpongeBob	I'm ready!  I'm ready!  I'm ready!
SpongeBob	I'd sure like to go to this party, but I can't read the invitation!
SpongeBob	But it's not an official record until we record it in the Book of Records.  19 seconds.
SpongeBob	A guest list consisting only your closest acquaintances will set an intimate tone for the evening and provide soiree success. Well, you heard the man, Gary, only our closest friends.
SpongeBob	And as long as we stick to this schedule, our party is a guaranteed success! This is gonna be the coolest party ever!
SpongeBob	Did you have any trouble finding the place?  Here you are!
SpongeBob	Yep, it's mild season.  Ahem. So, you read any...  Oh, more party guests!  Welcome Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	What's going on here? The laughter isn't scheduled until 9:03! You want to throw a party, do it at your house, Patrick.
SpongeBob	I have you making mild conversation with Mr. Krabs from 10:41 to 10:47.  But if you've got a case of the jabberjaws, I can hook you up with Scooter.  Here are some topic cards to break the ice.  Oh, someone's at the door!
SpongeBob	Hey Gar, got another coat for you.  The party's going great, by the way. They're gonna be talking about this one for a long, long time. Well, back to work.  Okay, everyone. Let's...huh? What's going on here?  This is all wrong! What's happening to my party?  No, no, no, no, no! Didn't you read the schedule? 10:00pm: Dance your pants off! 10:00pm!  Let's try to stick to the schedule, shall we? Cake will be eaten at 8:52, everyone! 8:52!  Hey, what's this?
SpongeBob	Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob	Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule!
SpongeBob	I don't even know how that happened. Well, I have no choice. I'm gonna have to tunnel back in!  Okay, everybody, don't panic, the host has returned.  I can take losing the topic cards and the phone in the punch bowl...  ...but I was supposed to lead the bunny hop! This is a bunch of barnacles! I'm breaking in!
SpongeBob	But, I didn't know. Plan Your Own Party Kit didn't mention the police.
SpongeBob	It was?
SpongeBob	Good night, Gary.
SpongeBob	Let's see...  Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Hey! A magazine!
SpongeBob	This guy's so rich, he has a swimming pool in his swimming pool!
SpongeBob	That's it, Patrick! We gotta becomes entrepreneurs!
SpongeBob	That's a great idea, Pat! We'll become traveling chocolate bar salesmen!
SpongeBob	Good afternoon sir, could we interest you in some  chocolate?
SpongeBob	Let's try next door!
SpongeBob	One chocolate bar, coming up!
SpongeBob	No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate... There must be SOMETHING. What was the reason we bought those bags?
SpongeBob	Why don't we try being nice?
SpongeBob	Um,  H-H-How you doin'?
SpongeBob	Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house.
SpongeBob	Good afternoon, sir, wanna buy some chocolate?
SpongeBob	They are most certainly not delicious!
SpongeBob	We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up and you come in for the kill!
SpongeBob	Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for...
SpongeBob	It'll make you sound smart.
SpongeBob	You'll rule the world!
SpongeBob	Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding.
SpongeBob	Poor, poor man. Is there anything, anything we can do to help you?
SpongeBob	Let's change our names to Why and Bother.
SpongeBob	Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money.
SpongeBob	I respect you, Barnacle Man!
SpongeBob	Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself?
SpongeBob	I do!
SpongeBob	Want to see me run to that mountain and back?  Want to see me do it again?
SpongeBob	Make that two!
SpongeBob	Time for Boating School! Let er rip, Gary!  Ahh...  Ta-da! Not bad, partner in crime! The toast could have been a little darker, though.  See you later!
SpongeBob	Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me?
SpongeBob	Behold Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning!  And this is the Fountain Of Learning!  And these are the Lockers Of Learning!
SpongeBob	Late for being early.
SpongeBob	And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board!
SpongeBob	I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project.
SpongeBob	The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher! Think you can handle the second chair?
SpongeBob	I guess it's just in the timing.
SpongeBob	25.
SpongeBob	No...
SpongeBob	What, me? But why?
SpongeBob	Just ignore him, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Hi?!
SpongeBob	It is after class!
SpongeBob	In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg.  It's all Stupid Patrick's fault.  I hate you, Patrick.
SpongeBob	I'd hate you, even if, uhh...  Um, I'd hate you...  even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out!  Huh?!
SpongeBob	I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet.
SpongeBob	Psst, try the coral bits.
SpongeBob	Wow, a trip!
SpongeBob	Here she comes...She made it!
SpongeBob	Yeah, and I've gotta get home to feed Gary.
SpongeBob	Woo! Is it another fishing trip?
SpongeBob	You're right. How do we get out of here?
SpongeBob	Why did he have to go like this?! Why?
SpongeBob	I don't know, Mr. Krabs, but I've got this strangest feeling that somewhere a pirate and parrot are arguing about me.  And the parrot is winning.
SpongeBob	Squidward's last name is Tentacles?
SpongeBob	Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day!
SpongeBob	Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
SpongeBob	Of course, I expect you to eat this.  It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary?  Wow, pretty good time.
SpongeBob	Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints.  On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary!  Gary?  Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win.
SpongeBob	Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape of his life.
SpongeBob	What!
SpongeBob	Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster!
SpongeBob	Uhh, Gary?
SpongeBob	No!  Hold on, Gary, I'm coming!
SpongeBob	You did?  Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary!
SpongeBob	Hey Patrick! You all ready for the big night out tonight?
SpongeBob	Let's continue this conversation in private, Patrick. I think some people are eavesdropping!
SpongeBob	Of course. Did you wanna come with us, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Hey there, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready to party?
SpongeBob	Only the most powerful chick magnet in town. The Underwater Heartbreaker.
SpongeBob	We're not lost, I've got my compass.
SpongeBob	Just follow our lead, Mr. Krabs. And, above all, keep it cool.
SpongeBob	Oh, I know what you mean, Mr. Krabs. This is only stop numero uno on our night of debauchery!
SpongeBob	Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Are you feeling it?
SpongeBob	How about now? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Good night, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	But, it's old and cold. And so very full of mold.
SpongeBob	Because it growled at me.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive!  Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, sir.
SpongeBob	Wait just a burger-flipping second.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing.
SpongeBob	Huh? Wait a minute! Oh no!
SpongeBob	Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking and I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and smaller...  Oh no!
SpongeBob	I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad.
SpongeBob	Yeah! So what do you think?
SpongeBob	Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop.
SpongeBob	Good night, Gary.  Oh...what the...?
SpongeBob	Squidward? Squidward?
SpongeBob	Thanks. Thanks Squidward.  Squidward, could you scoot over a little?
SpongeBob	Yeah, I like sleepovers.
SpongeBob	Here come my parents.
SpongeBob	Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	"Hey, Sandy, watch me do the ""Grouchy Squidward""!"
SpongeBob	Like this?
SpongeBob	Whew. That was close!
SpongeBob	Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety. If you guys were smart, you would join me. That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there. I was one of the lucky ones. I'm a survivor. And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again.
SpongeBob	I won't be alone, so I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny...  and Chip...  and say hello to Used Napkin.
SpongeBob	Listen, I've told you but I'm never leaving my house again.
SpongeBob	Never ever...
SpongeBob	I don't need the wish, Penny. Everything I could ever want is right here. In fact, let's sing our own song about the joy of staying indoors. I know of a place where you never get harmed. A magical place with magical charms. Indoors! Indoors! Indoors! Take it away, Penny!
SpongeBob	Well, here we go. From the safety of my home, to the outside world.  I'm taking my first step. So far, so good. I think I can do this!  Oh, dear Neptune, get off of me, get off of me! Chip! Help me, help me!  I'm still alive! I did it! I made it outside! Nothing can stop me now!  Is it too late to go back inside again?
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	Oh.
SpongeBob	Almost closing time, Mr. K.
SpongeBob	The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.
SpongeBob	Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	No, I'm not. I'm, uh...  I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!
SpongeBob	Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins.  Ta-da!  Uh... huh.
SpongeBob	I got 'em right where I want 'em.
SpongeBob	The kids are using them as... boomerangs.
SpongeBob	Listen everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!
SpongeBob	I'll say you have.
SpongeBob	I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago.
SpongeBob	Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun.
SpongeBob	Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Okay. Have fun inside!
SpongeBob	Customization!
SpongeBob	Nope, we've got something even better! Marshmallows.  Mmm... just like the astronauts eat.
SpongeBob	But Squidward, didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here?
SpongeBob	And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong! But it'll help if you just sing along...
SpongeBob	Oh no! I'll save you, Squidward!  Squidward, are you all right? That's it, chew, chew, and swallow. There, better?
SpongeBob	Oh no, Squidward, sea bears are all too real. It says so in the Bikini Bottom Inquirer.
SpongeBob	Never wave your flashlight back and forth really fast.
SpongeBob	Cubed. Sliced is fine.
SpongeBob	And never...
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	No. Like that.
SpongeBob	Don't run! Sea bears hate that!
SpongeBob	I don't know! I guess he just doesn't like you.
SpongeBob	Yeah, I'm glad it was just a sea bear. This circle would never hold back a sea rhinoceros!
SpongeBob	It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity.
SpongeBob	That was the worst thing I've ever tasted. Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again.  Barnacles! All these shenanigans made me late for work.  Uh oh.  All right!
SpongeBob	Is there a problem?
SpongeBob	But I don't want a new one, Squidward. My name tag is out there somewhere. Lost... Hungry... Who will help it? What if someone's using it?
SpongeBob	Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius.
SpongeBob	Oh, hi Patrick.  You said hi to me this morning, right?
SpongeBob	Patrick, this is an emergency! I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps.
SpongeBob	You were supposed to say hi to me.
SpongeBob	Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  The most important meal of the day. La-la-la... Gary's way. Bleah.  Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?
SpongeBob	Hmm, let's see.  I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins, placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk... and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster.  Good one, guys!
SpongeBob	Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it.
SpongeBob	Patrick?
SpongeBob	Have you forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?
SpongeBob	Not now, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Where?!
SpongeBob	My shirt backward... What the...?  My shirt's on backwards! I had my identity all along.  Oh, and just in time. Thanks, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Thanks, uh...  Betty.
SpongeBob	With pleasure, sir!
SpongeBob	I'm gonna follow his advice, by gum. I'll invent a flying machine!
SpongeBob	Well, here I go, Patrick!  I'm off to fly with the jellyfish! Ignition, check!  Landing gear...  check! Complimentary peanuts...  check-a-roo.  Ready for takeoff!
SpongeBob	It's working, Patrick! I'm flying! I'm...  falling!  Ooh!
SpongeBob	"Patrick, get ready to say ""Eureka!"""
SpongeBob	"""Local nutcase tries to fly""?! I'm a nutcase because I follow my dreams? Well, they laughed at the guy who invented light bulbs too!"
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Ahh, isn't it great working at the Krusty Krab, Squidward? Huh? Isn't it? Working here?
SpongeBob	Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest.  Litter.  Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper?  Kids these days.  I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now.  Where is that litter coming from?!  Not on my watch.  Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter.
SpongeBob	Who?
SpongeBob	Hi, officers. So, he's going to jail, right?
SpongeBob	You nice officers will protect me, right?
SpongeBob	Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard.
SpongeBob	Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next?
SpongeBob	We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!
SpongeBob	I'll take both!
SpongeBob	Here we are. SquarePants Manor! Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have.
SpongeBob	Patrick, wait, it's a booby trap, remember?
SpongeBob	Great, Frank. This is my friend Patrick. He wants to become a prankster too.
SpongeBob	What else have you got?
SpongeBob	Eww! Don't you have anything good?
SpongeBob	Thanks, Frank.  Here it is, Patrick. The ultimate prank-- invisible spray.
SpongeBob	Any particular reason you took your pants off?
SpongeBob	Give me that thing.
SpongeBob	No guts, no glory!
SpongeBob	Oh sure, it's...half past invisible.
SpongeBob	Wait a second, Patrick, my brain just hatched an idea.
SpongeBob	Let's go scare us some suckers!
SpongeBob	It's official-- we're the greatest pranksters ever. The whole town thinks we're ghosts.
SpongeBob	Krabs, we've come to haunt you.
SpongeBob	Wait, Patrick, I've got one more idea.  You're going to pay, Krabs.
SpongeBob	We're really sorry, Mr. Krabs. Please don't chop us into little pieces and eat 'em.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, thanks for being such a good sport.
SpongeBob	We should have bought the whoopee cushion!
SpongeBob	Did you hear that, Squidward? We get to keep working and working and working without ever having to go home! I've got to pinch myself, because I must be dreaming!  Well, I'm not dreaming.
SpongeBob	Team Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob	1,322...
SpongeBob	8,659...
SpongeBob	That's what I thought you said. Now, let me offer this as a rebuttal:  Stay back! I'm warning you!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, what's going on? Everywhere I look, I see killer Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	What does this mean?
SpongeBob	You're a bit smaller than I imagined, doctor, but I guess that's why they call you shrink . Do you think there's hope for me, doctor?
SpongeBob	I see giant Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	I'm ready!
SpongeBob	Bun.
SpongeBob	Toh-mah-to
SpongeBob	Fiber?
SpongeBob	Gee, thanks!
SpongeBob	It worked! I'm cured!
SpongeBob	Oh, Mr. Krabs...!
SpongeBob	That's me!  Mmm. My compliments to the chef!  Hello, what's this?
SpongeBob	What's in this thing? Treasure?
SpongeBob	Neat.
SpongeBob	Did you have a cool nickname, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	You want me to punch you in the stomach?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs.  Hello? Mr. Krabs?  You alright? Are you sleepy?  Mr. Krabs!  I don't smell his pulse.  What's that?  Is somebody there?
SpongeBob	Wow.
SpongeBob	Who cares how silly, pink & fleshy you look. How non-threatening, limp & soft you are. How...  ...oops.
SpongeBob	I get to be a navy buddy?
SpongeBob	I once won a marathon because someone dropped a penny at the finish line.
SpongeBob	Well, here goes...wow. I've never seen so many manly naval men. So tough, so brave, so...clever. And I'm one of them!
SpongeBob	Ok boys, let the SS Party drop anchor right here.
SpongeBob	Fire the torpedoes.
SpongeBob	Let me spin you a manly yarn.
SpongeBob	Why jellyfishing, of course.
SpongeBob	Well, uhh, I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, I guess I'll take my manly toughness trophy and head home now. See you around manville boys, uhh, men.
SpongeBob	Come, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot.
SpongeBob	By the power of Neptune.
SpongeBob	If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak.
SpongeBob	Elaborate, you vile fiend.
SpongeBob	Patrick! Can you believe it?
SpongeBob	All I said that there was evil afoot.
SpongeBob	Hey, Mermaid Man.
SpongeBob	You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement.
SpongeBob	Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp!
SpongeBob	Excuse me, Mermaid Man.
SpongeBob	Wow. That was even better than the old show.
SpongeBob	The doors are locked. The doors are locked and we are on the outside. Outsiders. What are we going to do, Squidward? There are Krabby Patties inside all alone.
SpongeBob	Are you hurt, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	I'm serious, Squidward.
SpongeBob	I've never seen so many mattress.
SpongeBob	Making a card for Mr. Krabs. To go with his new mattress.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Terrific, Patrick, you found it!
SpongeBob	Because that would be rude, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Yeah, and you woke up the guard worm too.
SpongeBob	Understood. Out.
SpongeBob	I dunno.  Great idea, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Wow, I think you're right, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Okay.  Can you explain the plan again, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Run, Mr. Krabs! Run like you're not in a coma!
SpongeBob	Careful, Plankton, I just mopped there.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Oh no! Mr. Krabs' lawyer! Speak to me!
SpongeBob	Really? Everything?
SpongeBob	SpongeBob LawyerPants, your honor.
SpongeBob	Umm...your lawyer didn't give me the combination.
SpongeBob	Yes, your honor. Poor Gram-Gram!
SpongeBob	Yes, your honor. Defense calls Squidward to the stand.
SpongeBob	So it was you who made the floor slippery, wasn't it?
SpongeBob	Defense calls Plankton to the stand.
SpongeBob	That's OK, Mr. Krabs. I made you a present.
SpongeBob	Carrying this heavy bag of snail food for Gary.
SpongeBob	Darn it.
SpongeBob	Gary, please! I'm trying to defeat the Dirty Bubble.
SpongeBob	Oh, darn it. Darn it.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I...
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Hey, Pat, you ever feel like you're forgetting something? Something important?  Hmmm. I think it has something to do with this bowl. Gary's food bowl. That's itI gotta feed Gary.  That's a lot of dust for a couple of hours.  Gary! Dinner!  Come on, Gary, soup's on.  Gary? Hey, Pat?
SpongeBob	Ten days? Gary!  Gary? Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Patrick!
SpongeBob	Yeah, something like that. All you really have to do is shake the can. Gary comes running every time. Pat, try it.  Let me see that.  Hmm, I don't understand; this is a brand-new...
SpongeBob	You check over there. I'll check in here.  Find him yet, Pat?
SpongeBob	Here goes nothing.  Look, Pat!
SpongeBob	Gary! Gary? Gary!  Gary!  Gary...!  Oh... Gary!
SpongeBob	Gary.
SpongeBob	Well, you see...
SpongeBob	If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it.
SpongeBob	"Here's a good spot.  ""Gary! I am sorry! Please come home! Love, SpongeBob"". Quick, hand me the tape."
SpongeBob	Pat, no!
SpongeBob	Gary loves balsa wood!  I got to try to forget Gary. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind.  I blew itI really blew it. I took you for granted, Gary. I'm sorry! Don't just stare at me, say something! I'm talking to a billboard.
SpongeBob	Okay, good. I promise, Gary, things are going to be different between you and I. You'll see, pal. Now let's go home and get you something to eat. You must be starving.
SpongeBob	Well, why don't I give it a try?
SpongeBob	Beary says he's getting lonely. Don't worry, Beary, I'll get you a friend.
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward.  Hey, Squidward.  Hey, Squidward.  Okay, Mrs. Wiggles, order up. Beary cooked this one all by himself. Oh, he makes me so proud.
SpongeBob	Pardon me, Squidward. SpongeBear, Jr. here wants me to win him a little brother.
SpongeBob	Hey, you want me to tell you the secret of how to win on this machine?
SpongeBob	Yeah?
SpongeBob	Yes?
SpongeBob	See? Now you try.
SpongeBob	In the machine, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Triple decker, on deck.
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah, you're the man.
SpongeBob	He did it. Yay, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Good morning, Squidward.
SpongeBob	What's that, Squidward?
SpongeBob	To inaugurate you as president.
SpongeBob	What colors should we paint the laves, your presidentialocity?
SpongeBob	Ok, Pat, gimme a quick shake.
SpongeBob	Yeah, our president sure knows how to live.  I'd like to call this meeting of the good neighbor lodge to order. Let's begin with role call: Patrick.  OKSquidward?  Squidward? Squidward, you home?
SpongeBob	As members of the good neighbor lodge, we are sworn to protect our president from danger.
SpongeBob	Squidward, have you ever seen more lovely French tips?
SpongeBob	Gee, Pat, maybe president Squidward's right.
SpongeBob	We hereby present you with this delicious cake.
SpongeBob	Nope.
SpongeBob	But we just wanted to
SpongeBob	What's happening? Mr Krabs! Mr Krabs, they're putting up pennants in the Krusty Krab. What's going on?
SpongeBob	Have fun, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! What are you doing here?
SpongeBob	Aye aye...Eugene.
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward!
SpongeBob	It's funny, because it's true!
SpongeBob	Another day, another...nickel!  2 Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	But...
SpongeBob	It's that bad?
SpongeBob	Is that what happened to you, Squidward?
SpongeBob	How long do I have to avoid laughing?
SpongeBob	Oh, no.
SpongeBob	Get a grip on yourself, SpongeBob. You're in control.  Just back away from the whoopee cushion, SpongeBob.  They're everywhere. Everywhere!
SpongeBob	I went a whole day without laughing and now my laugh is gone.
SpongeBob	Not really.
SpongeBob	The thing that used to give my life meaning and purpose but now mocks me with its cruel indifference.
SpongeBob	I read all the books and still nothing. I guess I'll never laugh again.
SpongeBob	You mean...my laugh box isn't broken and it was a cruel lie that sent me into spiral depression.
SpongeBob	It's really not that funny, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Hurry, Patrick, it's almost time for the joust.
SpongeBob	Isn't this exciting, Patrick? To think, we'll be watching the joust this close up.
SpongeBob	I don't suppose now would be a good time to ask for a bathroom break!  Patrick!
SpongeBob	Ah! I get the point.
SpongeBob	"Good one, Squidward.  ""Dost thou talketh to me?"""
SpongeBob	Knights, jesters, dragons, medieval bowling alleys, 12th century? Don't you see, Patrick? We really are in medieval times!
SpongeBob	Squidly, uhh, maybe you should wait for the king to hear that.
SpongeBob	Wait, you don't understand. We're not from here.
SpongeBob	I'll miss you too, buddy.
SpongeBob	Say no more, your majesty. Us manly knights are so manly, we kick ourselves out of places. Come on, Patrick!
SpongeBob	We just wanted to buy some armor.
SpongeBob	It's a good thing I packed us a lunch of delicious Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	I am bad, oh yeah! Whoo!
SpongeBob	Yeah, karate!
SpongeBob	Unhand her, you fiend!
SpongeBob	What the? Where? Oh  I didn't see you. You're so tiny.  That tickles! Tiny powers! Tiny powers!
SpongeBob	Sure, buddy.
SpongeBob	Sure it is. Just listen to him purr. He loves that Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	OK.
SpongeBob	You look fabulous!  Your gentlemen caller awaits.
SpongeBob	Oh boy, Patrick, I can hardly wait to see our favorite heroes on the big screen!
SpongeBob	Mermaid Man is timeless!
SpongeBob	Are you aware Drippy Brothers Studio is making the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie?
SpongeBob	Well, that makes it even worse.
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, what do we need to start a movie?
SpongeBob	Great, Pat, what happens?
SpongeBob	Adventure...
SpongeBob	Good one, Pat.
SpongeBob	You can be in it, too, Pearl.
SpongeBob	Patrick will run the camera.
SpongeBob	Makeup artist.
SpongeBob	Good job, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Ok, Patrick, start the movie!
SpongeBob	Cut! Plankton, next time could you keep the boom out of shot? Other than that, you're doing a super job.
SpongeBob	Almost there!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, this.
SpongeBob	Patrick, this is good. Roll the film.
SpongeBob	Fort Lox: home to over five billion Krabby Patties.  What evil mastermind would dare infiltrate this fortified fort and make off with its treasure?  It is I, Kelp-Thing! Do what I do!
SpongeBob	Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up!
SpongeBob	Well then... here ya go!  Well, Bubble Bass, whaddaya think?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob	Aw, this isn't right.  Good-night, Gary.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, hello. Do you how do?
SpongeBob	I how do that?
SpongeBob	Yes! I finally realize that I can't do it! I can't do it, Mr. Krabs! I'm a failure!
SpongeBob	This is where I belong!  .
SpongeBob	Wait a minute!  Look!  He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!
SpongeBob	Hip hip...
SpongeBob	Patrick!  Let me help you out of there, buddy!  Is the rest of you down there?
SpongeBob	Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before.
SpongeBob	Pretty.
SpongeBob	I was thinking more like jumping rope , 1-legged races [one leg goes inside his body and he hops on his remaining leg], or playing duck-duck-hermit crab.
SpongeBob	See ya at the Krusty Krab, Squidward. Hey, Sandy, what's this?
SpongeBob	Uh-oh, I'm late for work. Do you think your machine can zap me over to the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward. Now we can be best buddies and do everything together, forever.
SpongeBob	Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Two Krabby Patties coming right up.  Can't... reach the buns.
SpongeBob	Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other.
SpongeBob	Uhh, hi.
SpongeBob	So, I was all ready to drain the fries, but I cooked the fries slightly too long! So...
SpongeBob	Wow, what happened to the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	Yes, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Room service! Here's the 50 Krabby Patties you ordered.
SpongeBob	Thanks, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Yes, sir!  Here you are, sir.
SpongeBob	No good, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Honk honk! Beep beep! I'm ready to drive. Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	Now what do I do?
SpongeBob	I got Mrs. Puff fired.
SpongeBob	Ready for my test, sir.
SpongeBob	Pebble!  Oh whoa!  Oh whoa!  Whew!
SpongeBob	That'll be easy.
SpongeBob	Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel?
SpongeBob	Yes, sir!  Left turn at pebble #143. Kid with a ball.  Nice boy.
SpongeBob	Step 3 would be...  ...engage blindfold.
SpongeBob	Man down. Man down.  Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.
SpongeBob	"Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm ""unteachable""."
SpongeBob	Ooh. Mm-hmm. Oh... Oh! Whoo! Oh, yeah, that's it!
SpongeBob	Onward... to Squidward's house.
SpongeBob	Oh, come on, Sandy. I'll bet you invented lots of useful things. This helmet looks impressive.  What's it do?
SpongeBob	So it's got a few bugs. Patrick and I'll help you fix it. Right, Patrick? Patrick?  Everything'll be fine.
SpongeBob	So let's start inventing!
SpongeBob	Light bulb, already invented.
SpongeBob	I'm ashamed of myself, Patrick. I gave up too quickly. We'll build Sandy's bosses an invention so amazing, they'll give Sandy funding forever!  We've done it, Patrick! We've created the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Patrick, they're here.
SpongeBob	My name is SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	Gentlemen, I can say without exaggeration that this is the most important invention in the history of the universe! I give you...  The Automatic Backscratcher, Hair Comber, Nose Picker, and Ukulele Tuner 9000!
SpongeBob	That's not exactly what I had in mind!
SpongeBob	Oh, I really wish Sandy were here.
SpongeBob	Wow, Sandy, they're going bananas for your nutcracker!
SpongeBob	Squidward, you have to help me! There's a gh-gh-gh,
SpongeBob	It's OK, Gary.
SpongeBob	Well, you've been here a while, and, uhh, I've seen all your tricks.
SpongeBob	You just gotta scare someone other than me.
SpongeBob	Hey, champ! How's it...
SpongeBob	Dutchie! Do you wanna spend eternity on this couch?
SpongeBob	A journey into self-awareness.
SpongeBob	Now he's got him.
SpongeBob	And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon.
SpongeBob	What's this, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Detective work--I'm going undercover.
SpongeBob	Umm...I'm pretty sure it has a 'B' in it.
SpongeBob	Now this is obviously the greatest present ever.
SpongeBob	the delivery truck will be here momentarily.
SpongeBob	Here's the receipt.
SpongeBob	Just look at that shine! Now let's check under the hood.  Geez, Gary, this place is a real snail-sty.
SpongeBob	What could it be today, Gary?
SpongeBob	Ooh... Did you hear that, Gary? I'm going to be crowned...  King of Karate!  Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob	Maybe your karate was the best, but now they've recognized a new number one.
SpongeBob	Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived.
SpongeBob	"You hear that, Sandy? He called me ""master."" Bring on your best fighters! I'll try to go easy on 'em."
SpongeBob	I'm ready to be King of Karate!
SpongeBob	Oh, do I detect a note of jealousy, Sandy?
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	You mean I'm not King of Karate?
SpongeBob	I still have one question, though. Does this mean I'm not King of Karate?
SpongeBob	We can do this. At the count of three, we flip. Ready? One, two, three.  Spat?
SpongeBob	Oh, Spat, we've been through so much together.
SpongeBob	Ooh. Looks fancy. So shiny. All those lines so sleek. What am I talking about? I don't need this.  Maybe I do need this.
SpongeBob	I've got some loose change in my pocket, will this cover it?
SpongeBob	Now?
SpongeBob	That's everything I have. Now can I buy Le Spatula?
SpongeBob	Soon everyone will know of your beauty.
SpongeBob	Anything you want and more.
SpongeBob	Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact...
SpongeBob	But, but, I thought we were friends.
SpongeBob	I had a spatula once. A real spatula. One that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool!
SpongeBob	I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. Hes gone!
SpongeBob	: All that glitters is not gold.
SpongeBob	Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? One, two, three.  D'oh!
SpongeBob	A wishing well, here? Wow!
SpongeBob	Squidward, aren't you excited? This is really gonna help people. Take a penny and some magic, even though your life is tragic...
SpongeBob	You mean magic, don't ya?
SpongeBob	How long do I have to stay down here?
SpongeBob	Gosh...  Ow!
SpongeBob	Patrick, this is a wishing well. Just throw in a coin and make a wish.
SpongeBob	Well, we've got 6 hours till the end of my shift. What do you want to do now?
SpongeBob	Tag, you're it.
SpongeBob	This wishing well was a wonderful idea, Mr. Krabs. Has anyone's wish come true, yet?
SpongeBob	Aww, no one's wishes are coming true. What did we do wrong? I know I believe hard enough. Maybe I just didn't dig deep enough. What do you say, Patrick? Are you ready to dig for some magic?
SpongeBob	Do you wanna make a wish?
SpongeBob	We were just gonna play some party games.
SpongeBob	It means he's afraid of Santa Claus.
SpongeBob	Hey, hey, hey, guys.
SpongeBob	We didn't get any money. But we found something better. We found the magic.
SpongeBob	It's beautiful, Mrs. Puff. How's about letting me take it for a spin?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! No!
SpongeBob	Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob	Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this.  I hardly knew ya.
SpongeBob	Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor!  What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob	Patrick! Down here!
SpongeBob	That's hall monitor to you!
SpongeBob	Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority.  Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?
SpongeBob	SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report.
SpongeBob	Just put on your siren and I'll be right there.
SpongeBob	Say again, deputy?
SpongeBob	What's going on Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Uhh, Mr Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there.
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward.
SpongeBob	But there does appear to be something wrong with him.
SpongeBob	Yup.
SpongeBob	Uhh...
SpongeBob	But Mr Krabs, it's me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	All those people think you're a monster. But I know you're just a snail.  Gary...  how could you?
SpongeBob	S.D.E. and S.E.?
SpongeBob	Good ol' Gary's back.  Squidward? You're not a zombie, remember?
SpongeBob	Aye aye, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	What's a vacation?
SpongeBob	Replacement?
SpongeBob	I'm not here to see you, Squidward.
SpongeBob	You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit.  Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	Yes, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally.  Hey, that reminds me of...  Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax.  That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds.  That one's a jellyfish!  That's a pirate ship.  And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup?  Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here.
SpongeBob	Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Where'd you say you were taking me?
SpongeBob	I've been waiting for you, Patrick!
SpongeBob	You must've saved a fortune.
SpongeBob	I'm ready! I'm ready, I'm rea...  Ah, what is this? Curly tresses, poofy texture,  itchy scalp...  it's a wig!  Hi, Patrick. How do you like my new wig?
SpongeBob	It's ok.  Why did you do that?
SpongeBob	Thanks. I am very fashionable today.
SpongeBob	Notice anything different about me today, Squidward? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh? ...Huh?
SpongeBob	If you want to, after work, we can go look for a wig for you.
SpongeBob	Oh, that's my new wig, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Oh, please let me keep it, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	You know it.
SpongeBob	Almost finished.  See, Squidward, it's functional, too.
SpongeBob	Hello, handsome.  Sss.
SpongeBob	I think that it looks cool.
SpongeBob	So I can't have a wig or a butt?
SpongeBob	I know. People just can't keep their eyes off of me.
SpongeBob	You, too, Sandy. People are trying to watch the movie.
SpongeBob	I know.  I just want you to know that even though I didn't know you existed a few days ago, I can't imagine life without you!
SpongeBob	Patrick! At least he's not wearing a wig.
SpongeBob	I wish I had a wig.
SpongeBob	Reverse Whirlpool.
SpongeBob	I'll get a better look.  Mm. It's too dark. This calls for extreme measures.  Got it! Hey, the pointy bit at the end is missing.
SpongeBob	Ooh!
SpongeBob	Guarding Sandy's submarine.
SpongeBob	SpongeBob and Patrick reporting for guard duty.
SpongeBob	It's Sandy.
SpongeBob	No problemo. Nice and...easy!
SpongeBob	The reserve tanks are almost empty.  Patrick!
SpongeBob	Yay!
SpongeBob	I'm already on it.
SpongeBob	Reporting for Duty, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Ahh, a briefcase?! He might be a paid assassin!  But, Patrick, you can't go. Not like this. Who will go with me to the next jellyfisherman's expo?
SpongeBob	That's my peanut butter.
SpongeBob	But... what if you weren't Patrick Star?
SpongeBob	Too bad we couldn't come up with a better costume.  Hmmm...
SpongeBob	It's okay, Patrick. So you can't be a monster. But that vegetation on your head gives me an idea of what you can be.  You're all set. Come on out, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Actually, Larry, she's not my girlfriend, she's just a...
SpongeBob	But, Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't open for another two hours.
SpongeBob	Quite an appetite, but she's all woman.
SpongeBob	The assassin.
SpongeBob	Hey, buddy, what do you say we go home and get started on this list?
SpongeBob	Good evening, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Squidward, how come he's so emotional?
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	Not like that. With lots of love and affection. We can take care of him.  Well, Smelly, here you are. Your new home. Oh, Smelly, this is going to be great. We'll be one big happy family. Let me show you around. Here's your bed, Smelly.  Here's your food bowl.
SpongeBob	That's a great idea, Patrick. You always wanted a pet.  Isn't that cute? Look how excited he is to get to your house.  Bye, Smelly, have fun at Patrick's.
SpongeBob	Smelly.
SpongeBob	No, not that. I'm talking about the plan to break Smelly out of this animal prison.
SpongeBob	Fear no longer, dear Smelly, we are here to rescue you. Understand? We are taking you home.  Look how excited he is. Flip the switch, Patrick.  Smelly, you're free!
SpongeBob	Well, we're all one big happy family again. Let's see where this dark sewer tunnel leads.
SpongeBob	Come on, stovie, pop that corn!  Get ready, Gary.  Incoming!
SpongeBob	Here it is: Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit.  Look at all this! A book of spells, my very own wand of whimsy, the beard of Rasputin, and, of course, the all-important license to practice magic.  Squidward! He'll appreciate my newly delivered skill.
SpongeBob	Which brings us to... step three. Juggle something. Well, if you insist Mister Magic.
SpongeBob	I have turned poor Squidward into a frozen dessert.
SpongeBob	[yells as he points to the ice cream] Patrick! Stop eating Squidward!
SpongeBob	No! It's Squidward!  And no matter what happens, I promised him that I would watch over him to ensure his soft, frozen life is unchanged.  PATRICK! Squidward has MELTED! Quick, call the police. What am I going to do?! Oh, Neptune, it's all my fault! What have I done?! What have I done?!  It's all your fault!  Curse you, Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit! Curse you! Hey, that's it! That's the answer to our problems!
SpongeBob	Well, thank you, but well, I can't change him back.
SpongeBob	I'll wait.
SpongeBob	I don't know, Patrick. Who are you, good sir?
SpongeBob	I don't need a refund, I want my friend back! This isn't about money. You're nothing but a fake--just a lying, corporate businessman, tainting the purity of magic with your corrupt commercial ways!  You have ruined my faith in the magical arts.  AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!
SpongeBob	Squidward! You're back. The magic words worked.  I really am magical after all. Can I turn you into something else, now?
SpongeBob	No, Patrick!
SpongeBob	I'm a winner?
SpongeBob	I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner!
SpongeBob	Let's just go home, Patrick.
SpongeBob	I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?
SpongeBob	Perfect score.
SpongeBob	I'm so happy for you...  Whoa!
SpongeBob	Yeah, just like you.
SpongeBob	Patrick, what are you doing?
SpongeBob	You got a new boat.
SpongeBob	Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work.
SpongeBob	When did we get a drive-thru?
SpongeBob	What's with the helmet, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Oh, that would be great.
SpongeBob	Hey.
SpongeBob	Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?
SpongeBob	Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!
SpongeBob	Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this!
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	Oh, then what do we do with this?
SpongeBob	Ah, there's nothing like spending quality time with my Gar-Gar.
SpongeBob	Small portion meals?
SpongeBob	Wow, Patrick, that's great!
SpongeBob	Your wish is my command, your majesty.  Good townspeople, let us rejoice in welcoming our new king.
SpongeBob	Uhh, Pat, I'm not sure this is what being king is all about.
SpongeBob	Ok, thank you, sir. I'm sure King Patrick could use this walker.
SpongeBob	I know, isn't it great?
SpongeBob	Patrick, what's happened to you?
SpongeBob	Uh...well, I...
SpongeBob	No he isn't! Watch this! Fetch!  How many fingers am I holding up?  Play dead!
SpongeBob	Quit worrying, Gary. He'll be just fine. Good night everybody.
SpongeBob	Come on guys, enough is enough!  Uh-oh! Hey, take it easy! Ow! OK, I'll talk to him!  Squidward! Would it be possible to play your clarinet a little... better? I don't think the jellyfish like it.
SpongeBob	"La la la la la.  Missed ya. Uh-oh.  You shouldn't play in the street, little guy. You could get run over.  The ""Ild Ones""! That's a strange name.  Scallop!!  Bye ""Ild Ones"". I like your silly name. Hmm...""w"". Oh, oh, they're not the ""Ild Ones"". They must be the ""Wild Ones""."
SpongeBob	There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows. We've got to protect the Krusty Krab. The Krabby Patties must survive!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, this is serious!
SpongeBob	Uh-huh.
SpongeBob	An evil gang of bikers are coming to ravage Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	No, hide me!
SpongeBob	Me!
SpongeBob	Say that again, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Patrick, it's working. They think we're...vicious bikers.  Bikini Bottom, you're salvation is here.
SpongeBob	Don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty?
SpongeBob	What about our coalition?
SpongeBob	Then can we save the town?
SpongeBob	Patrick, I know this looks like the end, but you and I can get through anything. As long as do it together.  Patrick? Patrick!  Well, it's just you and me, Squidward. But I want you to know that we can get through this. As long as we...
SpongeBob	Sorry, Mr Krabs, it's just that this KelpShake tastes so good.
SpongeBob	Then why is he in your fist? [Mr. Krabs and Plankton come up with a good explanation]
SpongeBob	What's happening to me?  They've shutdown the KelpShake restaurants!
SpongeBob	Wow. This looks like a job for Ol' Reliable!
SpongeBob	Good night, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Patrick, Ol' Reliable has been stolen!
SpongeBob	Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return.
SpongeBob	Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!
SpongeBob	What! Really?
SpongeBob	No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net?
SpongeBob	I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.
SpongeBob	Ol' Reliable! Ah...ha.
SpongeBob	Well, I gotta go.
SpongeBob	What are you going to do today, buddy?
SpongeBob	Oh, he is good. You never really know a guy until you stare at him for eight hours through high-powered binoculars. Hey, where'd he go?
SpongeBob	I'm not acting weird!  You're acting weird! You're... acting... weird!
SpongeBob	Mr. Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net. I will pay one billion dollars for that net.
SpongeBob	A-ha!
SpongeBob	You  my best friend, you no-good jellyfish net thief!
SpongeBob	For SpongeBob. You made me a new jellyfishing net? That is so thoughtful of you. Patrick?
SpongeBob	Patrick, no!  So, this is it?
SpongeBob	Patrick, I want you to take this to remember me by.
SpongeBob	Morning, Squidward. I waited for you to stop sleeping like you asked. So, you got any plans for the day, Squidward?  Okay, Squidward, I'll catch ya later.  Hi, Squidward, wanna play?
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward, want to play?  Okay, Squidward, see ya later.  Hi, Squidward, want to play hide-and-seek?
SpongeBob	Something tells me Squidward doesn't want to play today. That's it. If I can't play with the real Squidward...  I'll just make one of my own!
SpongeBob	How does he do it? Right again, Squiddy. You little charades master, you.
SpongeBob	Order up, Mini Squid!
SpongeBob	I guess it's time for you to move on, huh? Onto greener pastures. Arrivederci, mon frere.
SpongeBob	"Mr. Sun came up, and he smiled at me. Said, ""It's gonna be a good one just wait and see."" Jumped out of bed and I ran outside feeling so extra ecstatified. It's the best day ever!"
SpongeBob	It's the best day ever
SpongeBob	But... the best day ever starts at the Krusty Krab. Guys, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave  Ow! Guys, you're ruining the  best day...  Wait, no.  Best day...  Huh?
SpongeBob	Mm-hmm. I see. Ok, then I'll come back later.
SpongeBob	Well, lucky for you, I brought my old net.
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, it's my turn, now.  Hey, Patrick? Pat, old buddy. P-Patrick? It's-it's my turn now.  I guess I'll see you at the concert.  It's the best day ever. It's the best day ever. Oh, this best day ever isn't going so good.  No work, no karate, no jellyfishing. Hey, I still have Squidward's concert! I won't let this one slip through my fingers.  Hey, Squidward. Squidward, what's wrong?
SpongeBob	I said play!
SpongeBob	One ticket, coming right up, Captain!  Must be here somewhere.  I don't have a ticket.
SpongeBob	A reserved seat? Next to my friends? I made it! All I have to do is sit down...  NO! (jumps on stage and tears the curtain) No! It is not over!
SpongeBob	Yeah, I guess so. But then I was going to do karate with Sandy.
SpongeBob	It is?
SpongeBob	Sing along. Hear that happy sound
SpongeBob	It's the best day ever
SpongeBob	Patrick! Happy Best Friend...whoa.
SpongeBob	Well, thanks for your appreciation, Patrick, but it's no giant, old, used ball of gum.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Patrick, but your gift has got to go.  Good-bye, stink ball. See ya never.
SpongeBob	Okay, no sign of Patrick. Better make this fast.  Get ready for your dirt nap, Gummy.
SpongeBob	Sandy.
SpongeBob	No, wait, Sandy. The more you touch it, the angrier it gets.
SpongeBob	Now, Patrick, I can explain.
SpongeBob	Patrick, do you miss your Gummy?
SpongeBob	Don't forget your condiments, Plankton.
SpongeBob	Best friends?
SpongeBob	It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Sabotage!
SpongeBob	Awww...
SpongeBob	That's me!
SpongeBob	Yeah. Not unless you look RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!!!
SpongeBob	Do you have any tips you can pass on to a rookie?
SpongeBob	Crying my eyes out.
SpongeBob	"The Krusty Krab deserves better than my meager skills. I should be professional. I must... resign.  ""Dear Mr. Krabs,""..."
SpongeBob	Goodbye, freezer.
SpongeBob	But you're the greatest fry cook in the world! The Krusty Krab deserves better than me.
SpongeBob	The Krusty Krab isn't a dump.
SpongeBob	Oh, it's nothing, Mr. Krabs. I just had a rough night. But it's nice and bright today!
SpongeBob	Great idea, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Save me, the darkness!
SpongeBob	Now that I can see...  Woo-hoo! I can sleep!  I wonder what's in my dark, scary-looking bathroom!  Night light! Night light!  Oh, thank you, thank you!  There, there, there, and there.  I've been needing to change your tail light anyways, Gary.  Now there's not one square inch of dark!
SpongeBob	That was close, Patrick! You're safe under these night lights. But you can't go out in the dark, buddy! You don't know what kind of creepy critter could be lurking in those shadows!
SpongeBob	Oh, Patrick! I'm so glad you made that gaping hole in the wall, letting in all t-t-t-t-t-t...
SpongeBob	Patrick, what if Squidward's right? What if all this is all in our imagination?
SpongeBob	Aww... Are you here to protect us from the darkness that surrounds us?
SpongeBob	Say, let me help you!  Is that enough light for you?  Well, he's all taken care of.
SpongeBob	Pat! Come Ba...
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, how was your morning?
SpongeBob	Wow, what are you gonna do with it?
SpongeBob	Well, how about...  This?  Or this?  Or this?
SpongeBob	Yeah! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride! Moon ride! Moon ride!
SpongeBob	Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naive? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99 stores?  And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night?  Ah! There's one now!
SpongeBob	A present?
SpongeBob	It's pretty impressive, all right.
SpongeBob	Yeah, Just don't touch anything.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I don't think we should...
SpongeBob	Look!  We're in space now! Whee!
SpongeBob	Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them! Uhh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to.  Make sure your gun is pumped.  Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting.  It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis.
SpongeBob	Let's capture the little phony!
SpongeBob	There's no time for that! Just push harder.
SpongeBob	Yeah? Well, I got you now.
SpongeBob	Send in the box tops...  ...before eating all the cereal?!?  Gary, you are a genius!
SpongeBob	We're waiting for the mailman. He's bringing me a free toy.
SpongeBob	Guess we'll have to keep waiting.
SpongeBob	If I leave, the mailman might come and I might miss him.
SpongeBob	What?! What do you want?! Can't you see I'm doing something here?!  This better be good.
SpongeBob	That was my cake.  What is the present?
SpongeBob	Yes, you do.
SpongeBob	Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
SpongeBob	Yes, yes I'm okay.
SpongeBob	Hey, my toy's okay!
SpongeBob	Oh my gosh! Your bowl is empty! Not to worry, Gare-gare! Food is on the way, faster than you can say  organic!
SpongeBob	Is something wrong, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Good idea!
SpongeBob	Ay-yi-yi! It's getting bigger!  Nothing a little pimple cream can't cure!  That's more like it! All better. See, Patrick?
SpongeBob	All what-y?
SpongeBob	What's going on, Squidward? Help!!
SpongeBob	Gary? Whoa!
SpongeBob	Sure! Let's begin!  Um... Patrick?
SpongeBob	There is no time for games, Pat! Now think, SpongeBob! The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands!  Patrick, you're a genius! And this one's mobile!  Now I can go back to work!
SpongeBob	Gary the Snail! Don't you know it's impolite to feed off of other people without permission?
SpongeBob	What are you doing, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	In my hands.  Ooh!
SpongeBob	Do you know anything about spying, Sandy?
SpongeBob	Nothing yet. Wait! Wait! He's...  ...buying baby clothes? We gotta get closer.
SpongeBob	Plankton just bought some baby clothes.
SpongeBob	We're right behind him, and he has no idea!
SpongeBob	Boy, it was lucky the sidewalk broke our fall. But we've lost Plankton!
SpongeBob	I'm afraid we've lost him, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Spies don't use the front door, Patrick. We've got to figure out a complicated way to get inside.
SpongeBob	It's up to you and me, buddy!
SpongeBob	But if you're Mr. Krabs, then who's...  Mr. Krabs is a robot!
SpongeBob	Hmmm, if he's Squidward, then you must be...  ...Sandy?
SpongeBob	Good one, Patrick!  There's just one thing I don't understand.
SpongeBob	Ah, perfect.
SpongeBob	Lalalalalalalalala! Whee!  Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob	Hi, Sally! Hi, Sadie! Hi, Shubie!
SpongeBob	I can't see anything in here, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Well, I simply compile the name of every customer in this book.
SpongeBob	See you on the outside in ten years, buddy.
SpongeBob	Order up!  Here you go, sir. One Krabby Patty, Krabby Fries, and Krabby Drink in three seconds flat.
SpongeBob	I was a minute late for work!
SpongeBob	Thank you, sir.
SpongeBob	Somethin's not right. What is it? Do I miss my old clock?  Maybe it's my old bed.  Oh, that's it.  I'll make the Krusty Krab just like home. What do you say Gary?
SpongeBob	That's right, I'm going to live here from now on, so I'll never ever be tardy pants again.
SpongeBob	Done.  All that, before we even open up our doors, sir.
SpongeBob	Oh, I live here now.
SpongeBob	Well, I had to put them somewhere and my underwear drawer is all filled up with Krabby Patties and the freezer is filled up with my iced snowflake collection.  So I put the cash from the cash register in the pickle jar.
SpongeBob	Well, they don't see to mind.
SpongeBob	But I'll only be here at night. Please, Mr. Krabs, I won't get in your way. Please!
SpongeBob	Well, I'll let you two get settled.
SpongeBob	Not if you get up and exercise! Hut, two. Hut, two. Yes, sir. my buns are nice and toasty.
SpongeBob	Hippo what-ia? What does that mean?
SpongeBob	Yes, sir.
SpongeBob	Coming right up, sir.
SpongeBob	Holy shrimp! Plankton!
SpongeBob	Oh, my weekend was fabulous. Thank you for asking. Patrick and I went jellyfishing but I lost my net. So, I tried to borrow one from Squidward, but he didn't have one. And then when he yelled at me, he swallowed a bug.  Swallowed a bug.
SpongeBob	Got you, Plankton.
SpongeBob	Here's your Krabby Patty and lemonade, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Excuse me, which way to the Fist O' Pain?
SpongeBob	No! Well, yeah. It's just that I had a bad dream last night.
SpongeBob	Boy, the Fist O' Pain sounds...
SpongeBob	No tickets. I must have left it at home.
SpongeBob	There it is. The line looks awfully long.
SpongeBob	I can't believe it, Patrick. It's Glovey Glove!  Get over there and I'll take your picture with him.  Get closer, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Yeah. Let's ride it just to see how baby-fied it is.
SpongeBob	Bye.
SpongeBob	Um, I have a confession to make. We haven't gone on the ride because I'm... hungry. I'm very hungry. Hungry, hungry!
SpongeBob	Oh, delicious dairy treat, I don't know what to do.
SpongeBob	Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it!
SpongeBob	Is that all?
SpongeBob	We made it.
SpongeBob	We're not crybabies.
SpongeBob	But now we don't have to face our fears. The ride is broken.
SpongeBob	Let's go again!
SpongeBob	Let's show him
SpongeBob	La-la-la-la-la-la-la.
SpongeBob	I guess I hadn't thought about that.
SpongeBob	I know. Isn't it great? It looks just like The Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Here you go, Squidward. One, two, three and four, and uh five and six.  That's it. That's the whole order, Squidward. There isn't a Krabby Patty behind my back or anything.
SpongeBob	Oh, Patty, I can't let them eat you. Your beauty must be preserved.  Amazing.
SpongeBob	What's cooking there, Patty? Oh, are you kidding? I love crepes. Oh, Patty, when we're together, I feel like we're in our own little world like, like nothing can hurt us.  Fire!  Fire! Fire!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Sandy. No time for karate today. After our walk, I'm going for a rowboat ride with Patty. Just waiting for her to put on her makeup. You know how long it takes a Krabby Patty to get ready.
SpongeBob	Good day, sir.
SpongeBob	There she is.
SpongeBob	"This isn't a piece of meat, Mr. Krabs. She's Patty.  And we're on a special date tonight so you don't mind if we get the ""manager's treatment,"" do you?"
SpongeBob	Grrrrrazie!  Here you go, my dear. A throne befitting a queen.  Oh, good evening, monsieur. What might we have on the menu at this fine establishment?
SpongeBob	Stop it, Squidward. Maybe you can't see Patty's beauty. But to me, she's the most gorgeous creature in the sea.
SpongeBob	I see now. I see what I must do.  Oh, Patty, my darling. Before I do this, I want you to know that I only do it out of love.
SpongeBob	Uhh, sir, I can't see you. The boots  are in  the way.
SpongeBob	I'm ready! I'm ready! I want those boots!
SpongeBob	And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders!
SpongeBob	Hey, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Could the greatest fry cook do that, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Good night, Gary.
SpongeBob	No, it's not okay! I lost the boots! Your valuable boots, it's my fault, I let you down! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Ohh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
SpongeBob	I heard his order, Mr. Krabs. He says he wants .
SpongeBob	Bye, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Waiting to watch the sunrise with you.
SpongeBob	Uh-huh.
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	Wow, that's a nice one. Thanks for inviting us to your big fencewarming party.
SpongeBob	But--
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob	Squidward, what are you doing here?
SpongeBob	What? Oh, that's silly talk, Squidward. I'm chief fry cook, and we fry cooks work alone. And, uh--  --we're not supposed to get distracted while we're cooking, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Oh, these are no good, Mr. Krabs. Squidward made them.
SpongeBob	Yes, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	The guy you're looking for is over there.
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	Oh, I'll just meet you all the way. Lay one on me, pal.
SpongeBob	As soon as the present customers are done with it. They like to chew their food thoroughly.
SpongeBob	Why did you give him the table?
SpongeBob	I think Mr. Krabs is gonna sing.
SpongeBob	I'm starting to worry about Mr Krabs.
SpongeBob	[back in everyday clothes] Hi, Mr. Krabs. I just came by to make sure you weren't, you know, totally insane.
SpongeBob	What's going on? What could it mean?
SpongeBob	I won't lose to that thing!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Squidward, you got to go lower to win.
SpongeBob	I think we better raise the bar.
SpongeBob	Well, see you at the finals tomorrow, Squidward.
SpongeBob	How'd the audition go, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Ready!
SpongeBob	Gee, Squidward, with your arms and legs doing all the work, I'm not really doing anything. I think I should help.
SpongeBob	I think I'm suffering for my art now.  Good gravy. Get a load of the talent here.
SpongeBob	Wow, Squidward, the crowd's gone silent.
SpongeBob	Oh, thank you, you're too kind. But I couldn't have done it without a very special someone.
SpongeBob	La, la, la, la, la, la! Wow.
SpongeBob	Morning, Squidward. Ooh! Squidward, where did you find those shoes?
SpongeBob	All aboard.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Sure is glad to be back behind the grill where I belong, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Ew, what's this?
SpongeBob	Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit!  Can we go now? My arms are getting tired.
SpongeBob	Patrick.
SpongeBob	You have to think of the words yourself.
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	That's the spirit, Patrick! I'll open a window.
SpongeBob	I don't see any dodgeballs here buddy. Just an artist and his work.
SpongeBob	oh...hmm... how do I put this delicately-- That was the best song I ever heard!
SpongeBob	Did you see the look on his face?
SpongeBob	Huh? Patrick--
SpongeBob	Look at that, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Yes, there is, Patrick. Sandy's been gone for two whole days.
SpongeBob	Patrick, that's Squidward.  He's not gone, he's right here.
SpongeBob	Ah.  Huh?  We've readied this place for Sandy's arrival, which should be about...  ...Whoo, right now.  Welcome home, Sandy, you know that we missed ya.
SpongeBob	Maybe a slice of cake will take your mind off of your crawling hide.  Patrick and I made this cake especially for your return.
SpongeBob	Uh.. Hey, Sandy. Sandy.  Surprise!  Patrick and I chipped in and got ya' a little somethin' somethin'.
SpongeBob	Ya ready?  And how 'bout now? You ready?
SpongeBob	Nyahh! Oh! Sandy, please, Help me,
SpongeBob	Whoa!
SpongeBob	Sandy! Oh, no! Are you okay?
SpongeBob	Is this how we will spend the rest of our lives? Living in fleas instead of water?
SpongeBob	A donut this nice could  make a guy happy!
SpongeBob	That's exactly how I feel about it.  Luckily, I videotaped the whole party so we can relive it over and over and over again.
SpongeBob	Get out of the way, Patrick, I gotta go!
SpongeBob	Ok... No problem. Ready to see this?  The official testament of how heartily we party... hardy?
SpongeBob	...Last night, silly!
SpongeBob	All ready, Mr. Krabs.  Just gotta clock out and...
SpongeBob	Lock up? Wait, Mr. Krabs. Don't you remember what happened last time you left me here alone?
SpongeBob	More power!
SpongeBob	The platter's all clean, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Oh, sure thing, Plankton. Here you go, little guy.
SpongeBob	Aw, what's wrong, Mr. Baby Krabs? Are you thirsty?  That's it, drink up!  OK, maybe you're hungry? How about a nice soft Krabby Patty?  Not even a Krabby Patty helps. How about a stack of 20s?
SpongeBob	I remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel.
SpongeBob	Catch who?
SpongeBob	What's wrong, little feller?
SpongeBob	Well, I've been thinking.
SpongeBob	And Squidward, I want you to have my can opener.
SpongeBob	No Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm not coming home.
SpongeBob	Patrick! Go home! I'm a jellyfish now!
SpongeBob	You guys are the best! I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me!
SpongeBob	Don't mind if I do.  Ta-da. Aww.
SpongeBob	Well okay you sit this one out Squidward, this will be a special delivery from the chef.  For your dining pleasure, 2 double Krabby Patties cooked to perfection complimented by a side of coral bits and a jumbo diet soda, topped off with a little extra love.  Enjoy your meal!  It's the little details that they really appreciate, isn't it Squidward?
SpongeBob	Uh-huh.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Um, right here, sir.
SpongeBob	Well, my time here is up. I am officially a Krusty Krab employee once again!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	OK, Patrick, this one's gonna be a masterpiece.
SpongeBob	Yes, it is, my friend. Allow me to demonstrate.  The sun must set at the end of every day.  And the curtain must fall at the end of every play.  And every little bubble ever blown must someday pop.
SpongeBob	...That will last all day.
SpongeBob	That's what happened, Patrick.
SpongeBob	No. Squidward, we'd never...
SpongeBob	The oldest living bubble, alive!  Behold Patrick-the oldest living bubble!
SpongeBob	No, but I'm game for singing any day! Sing? Sing a song? A song of wanting to move along!  To a land where all our dre-e.   Whoops, sorry. To a land where all our dreeeeeams, can finally come true.  A bubble I long for, that so eludes me, but soon enough I will seeeeeeeeeeeeeee...
SpongeBob	My friends call me SpongeBob. I'm here to see the oldest living bubble.
SpongeBob	No, sir.
SpongeBob	Someone help me!
SpongeBob	Oh, oh, I know, I know!
SpongeBob	Okay. Bye Squidward!
SpongeBob	Look at it Patrick! So ancient, so floaty. It is the most beautiful bubble wrinkled up, dusty old bubble I've ever seen!
SpongeBob	Boy, that would have been out greatest blunder without a doubt! But we should go before something bad does happen.
SpongeBob	Mmm-Hmm.
SpongeBob	Because, uh, Gary misses me?
SpongeBob	Patchy, it's me. SpongeBob SquarePants.  Don't lose hope. Everything will be all right when you get into Encino.
SpongeBob	Goodbye, Atlantis. But we really have to go. Back to a little town, that is the greatest place I know-oh-oh-oh-oh! Back to Bikini Bottom! I can hardly wait!
SpongeBob	You can't beat Bikini Bottom! No place is so nice!
SpongeBob	We had our fun!
SpongeBob	So now we say good-bye!
SpongeBob	We're Bikini Bottom bound!
SpongeBob	Bikini Bottom is the greatest place to be! I can--
SpongeBob	Fine, not to worry, no problem.  Vacuum, Rolling Pin, Crayon, Red and Blue Paint.
SpongeBob	Wait, wait, don't squirt! Please, you've got to spare me. I've got picture day today.
SpongeBob	Patrick, a little privacy here.
SpongeBob	That's it!  This jelly jar will insulate me from the dirty dregs of Bikini Bottom. If you don't mind, Patrick, we don't have much time.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I just wanted to take a decent picture today because someday, I will graduate from Boating School and I don't want to be remembered as the guy covered in peanut butter and taco shells!
SpongeBob	I can't stop crying!
SpongeBob	Okie dokie, Mr. Krabs.  Patrick, what's up buddy?
SpongeBob	Thank you, Mr. Postman. Thanks, Gary.  Hm, can't read the return address.  Maybe this will shed some light.  Hey, SpongeBob, it's your cousin BlackJack. Guess what? I'm out of prison and decided to pay your parents a visit. If you want to see them again, meet me for a wrestling match at their house. Try it little man. Blackjack.  Cousin Blackjack's out of prison!?
SpongeBob	Oh, no. That was years ago, Gary.
SpongeBob	That fiend. Where did he take them? I must find more evidence. What's this? Another note.  SpongeBob, I paid your parents a visit. Now, I'm gonna do the same with Gramma! You better hurry, little man-boy. BlackJack.  He's gonna get Grandma, too. I have to stop him.  Grandma! Where are you? Are you ok? Grandma? You in here? Grandma?  Oh, no, I'm too late! He burnt you to a crisp. Oh, that animal.
SpongeBob	Loose ends. My parents! He's tied them up?
SpongeBob	Uncle Cap'N Blue, I need to help my parents. They're in danger.
SpongeBob	I am desperately searching for mommy and daddy!
SpongeBob	But Uncle Cap'N Blue, I need the help of a crime fighter like you.
SpongeBob	Uncle Cap'n Blue is right. I'm not cut out for this. I should just turn around and go home.  Mother!  Mom?
SpongeBob	The fumigator's? So that wasn't a crime scene I saw at your house.
SpongeBob	Come on, Little Bobby. Don't let him beat you. You've got to stand up for yourself this time. That's it! I am not gonna take this anymore. I am putting my foot down. You wanna tussle? Well, let's tussle it up!  Cousin Blackjack?
SpongeBob	Hey, yah!
SpongeBob	With pleasure.
SpongeBob	Yes it is.
SpongeBob	Don't worry. I'm ready.  Bring it on.  Oh, good morning, Gare-bear.
SpongeBob	Go away, Gary. I'm busy... wallowing.
SpongeBob	No, no, it's okay, Patrick. He... uh, he learned his lesson.
SpongeBob	I handled him the same way I handle all enormous muscle-bound villains.
SpongeBob	That is exactly what I mean, Patrick. Well, see you later, buddy.
SpongeBob	Keep your natural remedies to yourself. Manly dudes like me don't need 'em. I'll have you know that I got this black eye in a fight.
SpongeBob	Oh, this was no mere man. He was the notorious outlaw Jack M. Crazfish!
SpongeBob	Ah, phooey. Late schmate. A tough guy like me can show up to work whenever he wants. Adios.
SpongeBob	Dah-dah-dah-dah, I'm just gonna stop you right there, Squidward. Spare you the oxygen. We all know you weaker folk can't afford to waste it.  All right, folks, listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Tough guys don't like to repeat themselves. I'm talking to you, grandma!  Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye.
SpongeBob	"Hey, let's save all the questions until the end. As I was saying... I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet.  ""Don't worry, I'll save you."" I assured... when a large bowling pin struck me in the face. The hurler was none other than Jack M. Crazyfish. And I could tell by that cold sore on his lip that today he meant business. With cat-like reflexes I preempted his attack. But the scoundrel had me sabotaged. And I fell face down on a pile of extra large staples. He lunged at me but I got him in the ribs with my novelty feather duster. Down he fell like a mighty oak.  And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears.  The force of his tears was so strong I had to take evasive action. But one of the blasts went haywire and hit me right in the face...  ...and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M. Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime. Whoo...football!"
SpongeBob	Mr Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive. I made all that stuff up. I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks? You remember.
SpongeBob	Noooooooo!...
SpongeBob	Yes, sir.
SpongeBob	Ladies and gentlemen, I present Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
SpongeBob	Hold it right there! You forgot your...Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob	And the delicious power of Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	Me too, Patrick, me too!  Oh Patrick, if I had only known how hard not saying goodbye could be...
SpongeBob	...this stuff is just my carry-on, quarter.  The rest of my things are right over there.
SpongeBob	SpongeBob SquarePants!
SpongeBob	This camp is very upscale!
SpongeBob	It's made it even more fun and challenging by the fact that we're wearing these heavy ankle weights.
SpongeBob	Uh... abomination?
SpongeBob	Cool!
SpongeBob	Aye, for Jib's men, what forces blow the merry winds of Galilee?
SpongeBob	You first.
SpongeBob	Survival training camp?! Patrick and I love camping!
SpongeBob	Thank you Squidward!
SpongeBob	Say, where did you get the firewood?  You burnt our food supply?! Oh-no! Quick! Quick! Cover it over something!  Hey Patrick, nice job.
SpongeBob	Sure Patrick, what do you think we should do?
SpongeBob	No hurry Patrick.
SpongeBob	Huh? Nice. We'll have the night here, and head home tomorrow.
SpongeBob	You're right Patrick, but what are we going to eat, where will we sleep?
SpongeBob	He's got the taste of flesh!
SpongeBob	It's all true! Patrick is going to eat me! What should I do?
SpongeBob	I'm cooking you, I'm gonna eat ya!
SpongeBob	Ah thanks Patrick! I did get a trifle unhinged, didn't I?
SpongeBob	Wait! Come back! You're not properly seasoned!
SpongeBob	I got you!
SpongeBob	Backing up!  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop...
SpongeBob	NOT THE MOLLUSKS!
SpongeBob	Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	I'll bet you're someone's famous poop-covered ancestor.  I never realized how sad and empty my life was, until my friends pointed it out.
SpongeBob	Seems like everybody in town has a famous relative. Everybody except me.
SpongeBob	I've never even heard of him! He got his own statue?
SpongeBob	Look, Sandy!
SpongeBob	Yeah! So long Squidward, bye-bye, don't do anything I wouldn't do.
SpongeBob	Uhh, Wednesday?
SpongeBob	Quiet and out of the way! Yay!
SpongeBob	Gary, wheres your holiday spirit?
SpongeBob	That's right! You're my worst enemy!  Patrick, you're not really not my friend. It's just Opposite Day!
SpongeBob	Patrick! Patrick, breathe!  Not that opposite. Let me show you how to do it the  way!
SpongeBob	Edis etisoppo eht ot teg ot.
SpongeBob	Wow! That's the nicest thing Squidward has ever said to me!
SpongeBob	Wait! It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite...  ...you have to act like him, too. Boy, oh boy, do I like playing the clarinet. I practice and practice all day long but I never get any better.  Now you try.
SpongeBob	Yes, please come in.
SpongeBob	Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard!  Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?
SpongeBob	I'm Squidward, he's Squidward.
SpongeBob	Don't...
SpongeBob	Are you sure you're not trying to say Roger?
SpongeBob	Please, contact immanent Patrick. Respond now. Please. Please!
SpongeBob	Should we turn around and check?
SpongeBob	No, not that, Patrick. This!
SpongeBob	Plus look at what we unearthed! A UFO!  Go on, you first.  Kinda dark, huh?
SpongeBob	Can we park here? [Squidward looks up] Hey, Mr. Krabs! Look what Patrick and I found! We're gonna use it to go on a long journey.
SpongeBob	Hello!
SpongeBob	Wait! We'll pay ya!
SpongeBob	Weren't you supposed to be on kitchen duty?  Oh, no. You burnt all the patties. It's hard as a rock. How are we gonna find somebody who would buy these?
SpongeBob	"Here, let me see.  No, Patrick, that says ""Abyss."""
SpongeBob	Daa! We didn't mean it that way, Mr. Sea Monster, sir! What we really wanna know is... are you hungry?
SpongeBob	What is it?
SpongeBob	[the monsters belly is still rumbling] Anything else before we shove off?
SpongeBob	You wouldn't believe it Mr. Krabs, we had so many new customers!
SpongeBob	Well, according to this shirt, it says my best friend is right here
SpongeBob	Oh, what are you...  Wait, Patrick this isn't what it looks like!
SpongeBob	We need new clothes to show off our best friendliness, Patrick.
SpongeBob	There was a battle of Bikini Bottom?
SpongeBob	That's ok. Thank you, friend.  So, anyway, and then I said...
SpongeBob	What are you saying?
SpongeBob	Clean!
SpongeBob	Ha! I got your nose!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Patrick , but a filthy slob like you is no match for a clean-cut fellow like me.
SpongeBob	You could use a makeover, though. Ugh, look at those feet.
SpongeBob	A little toothpaste, and you'll have teeth like mine.  Gotta brush in little circles!
SpongeBob	Ahhh, BOOGER!!!   Run, Mr. Krabs! Patrick is digging for gold!
SpongeBob	No, not patty socks!!
SpongeBob	Not for long, Mr. Sticky-Shorts! You won't have your filth once I use this on you!
SpongeBob	I'm covered in muck and scum!!
SpongeBob	And dry-clean my uvula!
SpongeBob	Fret not, my dear friend, for I have learned the truth. It matters not whether one is dirty or clean, for can cleanliness exist without filthiness, and would we know filthiness without cleanliness? We must not re-enact the history that divides us, rather we must embrace that which draws us together. All must be free to choose their own path. Right, friend Patrick?
SpongeBob	Come, Patrick, my work here is done.
SpongeBob	The best job...
SpongeBob	Hey Patrick! How goes it?
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	I guess that means there's only one place left to go. A place where I am wanted, wherever they like it or not!  SpongeBob WorkPants reporting for duty, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	"I guess that's it, then. If Mr. Krabs is calling me ""Idiot Boy"", it must be true. I know what must be done!  I somehow managed to make everyone mad at me. At least you still like me, right, Gary?"
SpongeBob	I'd really love to stay, but the people of New Kelp City need their mayor. Good-bye, everyone.
SpongeBob	I sure would, Squidward. That sounds...
SpongeBob	She'll be comin' around the Krabby Patty when she comes!
SpongeBob	No, please. Just... just don't.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Mabel. I'll bet your amnesia's gonna wear off in no time.
SpongeBob	Don't rush it! Sorry, go ahead. Wait!
SpongeBob	Hold it! The readings on this brain meter are all wrong! We must postpone the operation!
SpongeBob	I just want to say sorry for interrupting you before.
SpongeBob	Handsome. But she spelled it wrong.
SpongeBob	If that's even possible.
SpongeBob	I can't! It was one thing doing it by accident, but I can't hurt you on purpose.
SpongeBob	Hang on, you're starting to look like your old self again.  Nope. Still too handsome.  It's still not working. Maybe I'm not doing it hard enough.
SpongeBob	Squidward! look out for that falling shoe!
SpongeBob	Mmmm-mmmm. Goulash.  Hey, anyone out there! You dropped your goulash! Hello?  My pores are whistling in the wind.  Hahahahaha! That tickles!  Aww. The little critter likes my whistling pores.  That tickles!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! I need you!
SpongeBob	Aye aye, sir.  Let's get these patties started right!  That gives me an idea.  Oh, no. They found me.
SpongeBob	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... I like Krabby Patties! I think they're swell.  I like Krabby Patties And you cannot tell.  Krabby Patties Krabby Patties.  They're so neat.  La la la la la. Sweet to eat.  La la la la la. Really neat. Really neat.  Treat that's neat.  Sweet treat sweet treat.  La la la la la la la la laaaaaaaa!
SpongeBob	Ms. Gristlepuss, maybe if you were to taste the Krabby Patty for yourself, you too could experience the awesome pleasure.
SpongeBob	You know, it's too bad. The only way to make Krabby Patties again would be if you opened up a place that didn't look like a restaurant and did it secretly.
SpongeBob	Yeah, but...this is my home.
SpongeBob	If Krabby Patties are illegal now, aren't we breaking the law?
SpongeBob	Ms. Gristlepuss! Look out!
SpongeBob	Treat that's neat!
SpongeBob	Hey, somebody left me a package! Ahhhhhh ohhhhhhhh ah heavy! I wonder what's inside.
SpongeBob	Dear SpongeBob. I'm sending your cousin Stanley to live with you. He can't hold down a job and he ruins everything he touches. I can't take it anymore. Maybe you can straighten him out. Love, Uncle Sherm. Well, you're always welcome here, Stanley! My pineapple is your pineapple.
SpongeBob	Well, it was bath night.
SpongeBob	I don't just work there! I'm vice assistant general manager in charge of certain things. That's me turning the front door key! That's me serving a customer! And that's me performing sanitary maintenance!
SpongeBob	I know so. I bet my friend Squidward can help you!  Hi, Squidward. I'd like you to meet my cousin, Stanley.
SpongeBob	Err... Maybe you're not scientist material. But don't you worry. I bet Patrick can help you! He's a genius!  And so, Mr. Star, that's why we came to you.
SpongeBob	Don't worry! We just have to keep on looking!  Oh, gentle hat, symbol of employment! Cornerstone of my eternal happiness! I don thee now, in preparation, for this workday.  Wooo! You have no idea how this feels.
SpongeBob	Yes sir!
SpongeBob	Your job is to take people's money, and put it in here!
SpongeBob	I said I'm ready Stanley.  Whoa!
SpongeBob	About what I said...
SpongeBob	No! No! No! I didn't break my spatula. He did! And I also didn't burn your money. He did that, too! I have been covering for him because he can't do anything right!
SpongeBob	But Squidward, if I do that, then how am I going to help you get your house ready for the big TV show?
SpongeBob	Well that's good, because I lent my brain to Patrick for the weekend.
SpongeBob	Well, it all looked kinda faded.
SpongeBob	Cause you keep saying ow!
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squidward! I'll turn it off.
SpongeBob	Oh I wish I was grinding up the Krabby Patties. That's what I really love to do. Take a couple Boo-Ooh-Ooh! And a pinch of Awoogah! A teaspoon of *raspberry*  Then I mix some of this and put it over there, as I write this song.
SpongeBob	Add a splash of wee
SpongeBob	I know what you're doing!
SpongeBob	Yay! Come on, let's go get our band together!
SpongeBob	What's your news?
SpongeBob	Hear that, Patrick. You're in.
SpongeBob	Would you help us by joining our band?
SpongeBob	Well, with just a little more
SpongeBob	Man, how'd you grow that so fast?
SpongeBob	Squidward, aren't you coming to band practice?
SpongeBob	"Ah  ""Plankton and the Patty Stealers""?"
SpongeBob	Or One about my new friend Plankton?
SpongeBob	What is that?
SpongeBob	Brush, brush, brush my teeth. Gently keep them clean.
SpongeBob	Why?
SpongeBob	Got a, uh, what?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, I just need to get the key out.
SpongeBob	OK! Patrick, are you ready?  Plankton, are you ready?  Plankton?  PLANKTON!
SpongeBob	Sir... Sir!
SpongeBob	Yup!
SpongeBob	The thing I found was a bright, shiny, new... day! Well I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.  Good morning, Squidward!
SpongeBob	What can I do you for?
SpongeBob	Hmm, no.
SpongeBob	Shoe pockets. Oh, Mr. Krabs, that is just ridiculous.
SpongeBob	Hey look, it's my brain!  Hey where's it going?  Ooh, there.  Aha!  Not so fast, little guy. There now. Yes, I know. Come here.
SpongeBob	Do you think we should walk out back to investigate?
SpongeBob	Yay!
SpongeBob	But, but...
SpongeBob	My table? Fancy.  My very own name tag!
SpongeBob	If I only had one!
SpongeBob	No, that was just a dried up piece of gum for my collection. I think it's peppermint.
SpongeBob	Aye-aye, sir!  Monsieur's change.
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward, what time am I going on?
SpongeBob	Ok, I get it. Don't worry, Squidward, I'm going to come up with the most cultured act ever!
SpongeBob	Hey, Squid! How about this for the show?  The Amazing Mister Absorbency!  Ta-da!  Ta-da!
SpongeBob	So, this is what it feels like... the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny!
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward, can I go on now?
SpongeBob	"Let's see. Ah, there she is. Whoa!  What is this, Gary? Why, it's the complete history of all boating ever and I'm going to memorize it tonight for the big field trip tomorrow.  I'm perfectly capable of reading 7,400 pages and still getting my required eight hours of sleep before the bus picks me up at promptly at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get started.  All right, let's see what this little pamphlet is all about.  ""Chapter 1: In the beginning, Neptune created the sail."""
SpongeBob	No worries, I made it.
SpongeBob	This, the H.M.S. Pinafore, at 1 to 8,427 scale of course.
SpongeBob	Do you know which boat is fastest on record?
SpongeBob	No problemo, Mrs. P. }
SpongeBob	With two direct-action steam turbines producing 6,500 horsepower geared up to triple screws,  it'll get your spices where they need to go.
SpongeBob	I knew it!
SpongeBob	Ooooooooo-oooooooohhh-woh-woooh, how much chum could a sea slug chug if a sea slug could chug...  Mr. Krabs, you gotta get out here! It's a code blue situation!
SpongeBob	Wow, looks like Plankton finally has some customers!
SpongeBob	Yes!  Patrick? How could they? This is horrible!
SpongeBob	What do we do now Patrick?
SpongeBob	Sounds like Squidward ate at Mario's last night.  Good thing no one's around to notice his embarrassing...  Those construction workers! Squidward will die of embarrassment if they hear his dilemma! Poor Squidward, he must be in too much pain to make courtesy noises.  I'll cover for him! Whoa!  Sorry fellas, this sure is a noisy trowel.  Look at this thing!  Ah, I really should get...
SpongeBob	Okay...
SpongeBob	Yes, Patrick?
SpongeBob	What job is that?
SpongeBob	"Wow, Squidward, they really liked you! Just don't get a ""swelled head""."
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward, a banshee screams like this:  AHHHHHHHH...
SpongeBob	"What's wrong with me? I need to understand normal!  ""How to be Normal"". Hm, this video should help."
SpongeBob	Craters and freckles?
SpongeBob	I took your advice. From now on, I'm normal.
SpongeBob	Wonderful weather we're having.
SpongeBob	Hi, how are ya.
SpongeBob	Ok, see ya 'round.
SpongeBob	What you call dull I call normal.
SpongeBob	Let's do something normal, like window shopping.
SpongeBob	Thank you. Tell me, what are you doing cooped up in here when the weather outside is so normal.
SpongeBob	One more thing, Squidward. You don't wear pants.
SpongeBob	Please, Patrick. If anyone can teach me the arcane art of the weird, it's you. Teach me how to be me, again.
SpongeBob	Tap erus uoy era?
SpongeBob	I don't wanna be normal. .
SpongeBob	It sure is, buddy. It sure is.
SpongeBob	Wait, Patrick! Don't go!  Huh? Nothing! Boaty! I... I'm just going to bed.
SpongeBob	National No SpongeBob Day?
SpongeBob	I'm... glad you had fun.
SpongeBob	7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2,  Open for business!
SpongeBob	Ow. Ow. Ow. You're making this a little bit difficult. Luckily, I am ambidextrous!  Perfection!
SpongeBob	Yes.
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Good one, Squiddy.
SpongeBob	Finds out what?
SpongeBob	Why? Hey, wait, I'm fine!
SpongeBob	No, anything but that.  Please, Squidward, you can't let this happen!  You can't let them force me away!
SpongeBob	He does?
SpongeBob	Thanks, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Patrick, this isn't helping!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm sorry. I really need your help.
SpongeBob	Ah.
SpongeBob	Heh, company pride, of course.
SpongeBob	What's worker's compensation?
SpongeBob	You see Squidward! Slide whistling can add a little zest to the humdrum of everyday life.
SpongeBob	Alright!
SpongeBob	Come, play some more maestro. Me and Patrick want to sing to your saweeet tunes!
SpongeBob	Patrick, do you think Squidward is taking this a little too far?
SpongeBob	Doctor, why did you leave the whistle in his throat?
SpongeBob	What's that Pat?
SpongeBob	I don't know about this Patrick.
SpongeBob	I don't know Patrick, this looks very danger...
SpongeBob	Mmm-hmm.
SpongeBob	Now you just let me handle those guys out there.  Gentlemen, Gentlemen.
SpongeBob	So scared! Adrenalin pumping!  Spine tingling! Endorphins rushing! I've never felt so alive! Oh, yeah baby, yeah! This is what Patrick was talking about! This is really living in the moment! Woo-yeah! This is life! Woo, woo, yeah, woo!  Now I am finally living like Larry!
SpongeBob	Prepare for countdown!
SpongeBob	What are you two lazy bones doing lying around? There's a really cool ramp down the hall, I've got room for two more. (Looks crazy in eyes) What would Larry do?
SpongeBob	Who's Craig Mammalton?
SpongeBob	Must be this tan to enter.
SpongeBob	There, now that we've turned your rock into a tanning bed, we're sure to get tan enough for the party! Let's just test it out first to be sure.
SpongeBob	No, no, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly! It's really important...  It's working.  Okay Patrick, I'm done.  Patrick? Patrick, you there?  Patrick?
SpongeBob	What, what, what do you mean?
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm not a ghost Squidward.  I used Patrick's tanning booth, and I stayed under too long.
SpongeBob	Oh yeah, that hit the spot.
SpongeBob	Wooh!  Thanks Patrick.  Uh, I'm stuck.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick I...
SpongeBob	Patrick is helping me to do good deeds today, like trimming your kelp garden.
SpongeBob	That's a great idea Squidward!
SpongeBob	There, now you have plenty of space.
SpongeBob	I know, and it is a burden I must carry. But times a wasting! We need another good deed!
SpongeBob	Hmm, how to fix his nose?
SpongeBob	I think I'll just even him out. First, a bigger head.
SpongeBob	That's easy, play giant lumbering monster tag!
SpongeBob	You are very good at pretending Squidward. Look how you're all sweaty and angry, and you got the whole town to play along.
SpongeBob	Good night, Squidward.
SpongeBob	We shall do him another.  We did it!
SpongeBob	A-ha!  Hey!  Okay, that's far enough! Huh?  Tarter sauce!
SpongeBob	Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.
SpongeBob	Hi, Mr. Plankton.
SpongeBob	No, but I like to go jelly...
SpongeBob	You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this!  Like that.
SpongeBob	Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a...
SpongeBob	Here, let me help you, F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, try it!
SpongeBob	Who knows? Maybe he's changed.
SpongeBob	What's this all about, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	I sure like sequels, Plankton.  Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend.  Hey Bubble Bass!
SpongeBob	I cant believe this!
SpongeBob	But we sang The F.U.N. Song!  I think I'm gonna be sick! How long?
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	It's not so ab-normal to be noseless. Just look around. Lots of fish don't have noses.
SpongeBob	There it is, Patrick! Your brand new sniffer! Looking good buddy!  Well, I've gotta go to work now. Have fun with your new nose.
SpongeBob	Patrick, help!
SpongeBob	It is not Patrick's fault!
SpongeBob	Here lies the nose of Patrick Star. Rip.  Well this is terrible! All Patrick wanted was to be like the rest of us, and we punished him for it!
SpongeBob	Ooh yes sir. And they've been the best years of my life, sir.
SpongeBob	I won't let you down.
SpongeBob	Yes sir!  And now, let's get you into the Krabby Patties, secret ingredienty.  Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? No! What's going to happen to the Krabby Patty secret recipe?  What's this? A hole? How did that happen? An incision. Almost as if someone, or something did this on purpose. That's it! A thief must have cut a hole, and swiped the secret ingredient! But who?
SpongeBob	Hi, Patrick. Maybe you can help me.
SpongeBob	Someone stole it, Patrick! And we need to find out who!
SpongeBob	Oh, come on, Plankton, don't play dumb. You know you stole the secret Krabby Patty ingredient!
SpongeBob	Then how do you explain this?
SpongeBob	Yuck.
SpongeBob	"Oh long enough, ""buddy."""
SpongeBob	...then used a time-freezing device to freeze time, used a laser beam to cut open the case, stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient,  reverse engineered it, and made your own patties. So you wouldn't have to pay.
SpongeBob	You've told us that story 100 times now, Gary. Unfortunately, my partner and I don't want to hear stories, we want to hear the truth! Look, we know you stole the secret ingredient and it's obvious how you did it!  First, you hitched a ride on a security chopper, then jumped into the drop zone. Then, when I stopped to pull up my sock, you snuck up behind me, and did what any snail could do. You shot corrosive acid from your tearducts, which melted the case, allowing you to steal the secret ingredient.
SpongeBob	You did see someone leaving the Krusty Krab with a mysterious black case that night? Mr. Snail, could you please describe this, this marauder to the sketch artist.
SpongeBob	Well, I'm glad you asked, because this is about you stealing the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!  And we have an eye witness who saw you leaving the scene of the crime, with a mysterious black case.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I don't know how, sir, but somebody stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!
SpongeBob	Me?!
SpongeBob	Yes, sir!
SpongeBob	Oh, fishpaste!
SpongeBob	So you're saying that you love Chum? And all that you ever eat, is Chum?
SpongeBob	Triple irony, Plankton! Though you nabbed Krabs trying to steal your formula, I'm still here to ruin your evil plans! So it's like a dollop of irony on top of an ironic twist.  I mean just think about that.  You know, in a weird way, it's like we never left the...
SpongeBob	Breathing.
SpongeBob	Coffee rain!
SpongeBob	Squidward! Squidward!
SpongeBob	Didn't you used to have one of those cucumber bicycles?
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Oh, I understand. I understand perfectly, boating buddy.
SpongeBob	Do you like it Squidward?
SpongeBob	Uh, step on the gas?
SpongeBob	Pst, hey, boating buddy, if you need any help, I've taken this test hundreds of times, and.
SpongeBob	Before what?
SpongeBob	Order up!
SpongeBob	What a fantabulastical day! Eh, Squiddy?
SpongeBob	Whoa, this story is juicy!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, isn't that lying?
SpongeBob	Let's see what there is to see. Wait a minute. Larry the Lobster. Hmm, wonder what kind of dirt he has under those muscles.  Uh-huh, this looks shady, very shady.
SpongeBob	Ruined? What are you talking about?
SpongeBob	Yeah, but isn't there a way we could write juicy stories without hurting people?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, we're hurting people!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I can't write these stories anymore.
SpongeBob	Oh, the wildest story ever, huh?
SpongeBob	You wanna stay here? At my house? With me?
SpongeBob	No. They invite boys over and destroy the house!
SpongeBob	But, Mr. Krabs, its only a mov-ieeeeeeeeee.........
SpongeBob	Zombie teenagers?
SpongeBob	Gosh, no, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Pizza delivery.
SpongeBob	Um.. uh...  Hey!
SpongeBob	Oh, Mr. Krabs, thats my eye!
SpongeBob	Maybe we should leave them alone, Mr. Krabs. They seem pretty trustworthy.
SpongeBob	Oh, please let me stay at your party! Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please!
SpongeBob	Really?!
SpongeBob	Whoo! Party!  Crank it up!
SpongeBob	Party!
SpongeBob	Lets boogie! Whoo!
SpongeBob	Bikini Bottom pet show today! Good thing I put those notes there. Otherwise I could've forgotten. And I wouldn't wanna do that because the Bikini Bottom pet show is where you gotta go to see the best pets in town. Not that any other pet can take a chance against my buddy Gary. He's the bestest pet in the whole world. Love you, Gar-Gar.  Oh! The show starts in an hour! Hey, Gar, time to... Gary? Ow! Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary?
SpongeBob	Huh, people sure seem to treat their pets differently here.
SpongeBob	Uh Gary?
SpongeBob	No, not you.
SpongeBob	And the piece de resistance: glow-in-the-dark paint. Hey, where are you going? Gary, wait. We got to go back to the pet show!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm so glad you just happened to show up. Help me.  Gary, stop it. I'm only doing this because I love you. Gary, look, it's him.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm right here.
SpongeBob	Come on, buddy.
SpongeBob	Gary, no! Gary, you spit him out right now! I'm sorry. He usually only bites me.
SpongeBob	Well, I won't let it happen again.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs. The f-f...
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, you didn't... forget... to pay the power bill again, did you?
SpongeBob	Aloha, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Just dragging it around.
SpongeBob	We were just at Goo Lagoon selling Krabby Patties when this big wave hit us. Now we're on an island?
SpongeBob	Never mind.
SpongeBob	O-only way.... back... surfing.... Bikini Bottom? AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SURF!!!

SpongeBob	I've never seen anything more beautiful. Have you, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Would it make you feel better if I went and talked to him?
SpongeBob	Where's he going?! Come on!
SpongeBob	A perfect wave?
SpongeBob	Keep paddling, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Hang on, Squidward! This is it!
SpongeBob	JKL! And Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Hey, Twitch!!
SpongeBob	Ahh, nothing quite like a relaxing stroll  deep  in Jellyfish Fields.  I'd know that sound anywhere! Its a terrifying shriek! But wheres it coming from?  Patrick, what is with all the shrieking? You know I walk here on Tuesdays.
SpongeBob	Wait a minute, if the shriek wasnt coming from you, then where was itits over there, behind that kelp shrub!
SpongeBob	W-W-What are we gonna do?
SpongeBob	They like this!
SpongeBob	Patrick, the clam had a baby!
SpongeBob	A baby volleyball!
SpongeBob	Maybe we should do some stretches, first.
SpongeBob	138, 139,

SpongeBob	Whoa. How many more trucks do you think therell be, Patrick?
SpongeBob	YupI mean, nope.
SpongeBob	The mall!
SpongeBob	Patrick, that was the best shopping day ever!
SpongeBob	Oh, wasnt that incredible, Patrick? I mean, with all this money, we couldve bought anything in the whole world!
SpongeBob	Two, please: one for me and one for my best friend, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Are you gentlemen low on funds? Let me help.  Here you go.
SpongeBob	Oh, you wanna buy some ice cream?
SpongeBob	Thats my name, dont wear it out.
SpongeBob	Like I was saying
SpongeBob	Why certainly. I always remember to  Oh, I forgot. I keep it in this other pocket.  Uh, will you excuse me for a moment?
SpongeBob	Whatcha doing?
SpongeBob	Patrick, if having a bunch of money makes me forget that forget that youre my best friend, then I dont want anymore money, ever again.
SpongeBob	Squidward? My playmate Patrick is away, at a family reunion. Sad and Alone, I am desperate for something to do, or someone to play with.
SpongeBob	Are you going to a fancy store?
SpongeBob	Can I come? Can I come? Can I come? Can I come? Can I come? Can I come? Can I come? Can I come? Can I come?
SpongeBob	"I may not as be you and your buddies, Squidward. But I do have a song in my heart I want to share.  Then SpongeBob sing ""Laaaaaa""."
SpongeBob	I'm good enough to join the Men's Chorus. I promise!
SpongeBob	What a lucky break!
SpongeBob	Uhm Squidward, could you keep it down please? I'm trying to find my starting pitch here. Laaa!
SpongeBob	That's right! I'm a singing traffic cop!
SpongeBob	Ooooh!
SpongeBob	Well... I...
SpongeBob	Uhm...  I'll do it! But only if you find a spot for my inspiration, and great friend, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Not too close, Sandy. I tend to get smelly when I'm pumping iron. Check it out.
SpongeBob	Well, uhh, maybe I could use a little help.
SpongeBob	They're up.
SpongeBob	Hey, that's great, Sandy. Well, I sure had fun, we'll have to do it again sometime, bye.  This working-- Ow. --thing isn't working-Ow.  Ow. Ow. Ow.
SpongeBob	I wanna be just like him. Yeah, I've gotta get to a phone!  Hi, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Who were you expecting, Tiny Tim? Wait...wait...  They're big aren't they?
SpongeBob	Working out is my life! I remember when I used to look like that guy over there.
SpongeBob	I've created my own workout routine that's given me amazing results.  Whoops! Yeah, I have never felt better.
SpongeBob	Do these muscles lie?
SpongeBob	Uhh, well, I'm not sure.
SpongeBob	Wait, Sandy-- don't sign just yet!
SpongeBob	Oh, great. Thanks, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Oh, this is it. They're all gonna find out I'm a fake. I can't give up. I've got to try. I can do it! I've got Anchor Arms! I'm no wimp, I'm a jerk!
SpongeBob	...9. 10.  Can you get that?
SpongeBob	I don't know. What do you...  Ohhh. Whatever it is, it's really big.
SpongeBob	Hey, who are those guys, Mr. Krabs? They look like they wanna hurt us.
SpongeBob	Wow! Can we have cool nicknames too?
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	Okay, we're ready.
SpongeBob	Did it just get dark in here?
SpongeBob	Hey, look, Patrick, it's Mr. Krabs cheering us on.
SpongeBob	How fun was that?
SpongeBob	Alright, you two, no more messing around. You see this?  It's just a spatula, right? Wrong! Actually, this represents your face after I get through mangling it.  There, you see that? It's not gonna be pretty when I get done with ya.
SpongeBob	Really? Me, too.
SpongeBob	Fake wrestling.
SpongeBob	See you at Wrestle Camp, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Sure thing, Quincy, sure thing.

SpongeBob	So... shiny... and smooth!  Ah... oh! Oh!  Oooh! Mermaid Man's bubble-powered wheelchair from season twelve! And Barnacle Boy's bunion! Holy scallops! It's the dentures that Mermaid Man used to pop the Dirty Bubble in episode four-hundred two! Wow! These must be the most valuable cards in the world! I'll treasure them forever.
SpongeBob	No, it's just another...
SpongeBob	Patrick! That's the ultra-rare number fifty-four talking card! It's really valuable and there's only five in existence. And bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla! Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla blee bla bla! Blee blee bla1 Patrick! Bla bla blzzz! So now do you understand why you should take really could care of that card?
SpongeBob	Patrick, this is serious. You're carrying precious cargo now. You can't just wander aimlessly around like you've been...
SpongeBob	The super-rare and priceless Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy trading card! Patrick! Where is it? Where is it? Dear Neptune! You didn't put it in your pocket, did you? It's getting all bent up! Bent up!  Bent up! Bent up! Bent, bent, bent, bent up!
SpongeBob	Sure, pal. Anything for you.
SpongeBob	Uh, Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! Don't ya think maybe... that you shouldn't...
SpongeBob	Ohhhh! It's ruined!
SpongeBob	Number 54! Patrick, where did you get these?!
SpongeBob	Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Show me what?
SpongeBob	Wow.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, what's a Viking?
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Whoa....
SpongeBob	But-
SpongeBob	Dear Vikings, I am writing to ask you guys about your lives and stuff.  If you would take the time to  answer all my neat questions,  then that would be  really swell.
SpongeBob	Huzzah!
SpongeBob	I can't believe how much I'm learning.
SpongeBob	Well, like... what do the Vikings like to do for fun?
SpongeBob	I'll let you know if I think of anything.
SpongeBob	Wait!  You can't do that.
SpongeBob	But, but I...
SpongeBob	But, how ya gonna patch up a leak with that?
SpongeBob	Here goes nothing!
SpongeBob	I'll be in boating school at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

SpongeBob	You feeling all right?

SpongeBob	Patrick, you know how to play this game?
SpongeBob	Hey, I'm getting pretty good at this game!
SpongeBob	C-c-c-c...  ...criminal?  I gotta go back to class!  I can't be a ditcher!  Almost there. Just have to get past the...  ...Bikini Bottom Hug Fest?
SpongeBob	"Whoa!  The tar pits?  Ah! I'm sinking!  Well, I guess this is the end, SquarePants. But like the old saying goes, ""Better to end up sinking into a prehistoric lake of tar, then to turn to a life of crime!"" Goodbye, world. Goodbye, Mrs. Puff. I'll always cherish those last kind words that you said to me."
SpongeBob	Okay, Mrs. Puff. I'll never ditch again! I promise.
SpongeBob	We've got Squidward. And I could get Patrick to join up.
SpongeBob	Ahoy, Captain! We be catchin' a mighty gale from the northeast.
SpongeBob	Workin' at the Krusty Krab! Workin' at the Krusty Krab! La, la, la, la! Loo... Squidward? Squidward?  Squidward, are you okay?
SpongeBob	What is it about the third Wednesday of every month that makes Squidward so happy?
SpongeBob	Do we get to join the lodge?
SpongeBob	Or... maybe not. They didn't let you join either?
SpongeBob	Don't you worry, Squidward. I'm sure if Patrick and I just explain what happened, they're sure to let you back in.
SpongeBob	No. You can't set foot in the lodge.
SpongeBob	Squidward, you're the lodge expert. What do we do first?
SpongeBob	Not the way we do it.
SpongeBob	Okay, we can let him out now.
SpongeBob	Would you care to go first, Brother Patrick?
SpongeBob	Somebody already had Feather Buddies.
SpongeBob	Not just a sock...a disguise. Patrick and I will climb inside the sock and pretend to be a giant albino eel. We will then gain entrance to the lodge, and frighten everyone inside. Once they're good and terrified, you, Squidward, will storm in, defeat that giant eel, and rescue all the lodge members. You'll be a hero, Squidward. They'll half to let you back in the lodge!
SpongeBob	Roar!
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward.  Pretty incredible shift, huh?
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward. Wait up! Squidward! I realized I really didn't extend a proper invitation back there.  So what do ya say, Squidward? How about you come over to my house for a visit tonight? . Squidward?  Squidward?  Squidward?  Squidward? .
SpongeBob	Okay, Squidward. Maybe some other time.
SpongeBob	. Patrick? Has Squidward ever visited you at home?
SpongeBob	Oh, hey, Squidward! Just doin' a little home improvement.
SpongeBob	SquarePants residence.
SpongeBob	You won't even recognize the place, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Well, you said you wouldn't leave the comfort of my home,  so I brought the comfort here!  Isn't it great?!
SpongeBob	Nachos?
SpongeBob	Okay, Squidward, just yell if you need anything.
SpongeBob	"Did someone say ""rash cream?"""
SpongeBob	Tsk.  Hurry back, Squidward!
SpongeBob	It sure was nice having Squidward over for a visit, eh, Gary?
SpongeBob	Mm, speaking.
SpongeBob	Yeah, Patrick.  Gary?  They've shrunk!  I'm gonna need to get new pants.
SpongeBob	Patrick is so full of tartar sauce. I'm still me. It's just a pair of pants. It's not like my friends won't recognize me.
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward! Guess who?
SpongeBob	Squidward didn't know me either. It's like we'd never met. Maybe Patrick is right.  Oh no, it's locked.  Gary! Hey, Gary! Can you open the door?! I left my keys in the other pants.
SpongeBob	"Oh, barnacles! I guess I'm not 'SpongeBob SquarePants' anymore. I'll have to start all over again.  Hello, sir. I'd like an application, please. My name is SpongeBob Sq...  Sorry, I'm a little...  I'm a little...  I'm a little nervous. My name is SpongeBob... Roundpants. And I would like to seek employment at this eating establishment.  Oh, dear!

SpongeBob	Okay, get in.
SpongeBob	Oh, look, the mourners have arrived.
SpongeBob	But-
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, he's the fool. He's a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever.
SpongeBob	No, what you said before when you...
SpongeBob	Isn't he beautiful?
SpongeBob	Okay Patrick! Here I come!
SpongeBob	Well, who knows how long it ... Ah! Mother of Neptune! Get away from me! Get away from me!
SpongeBob	Gary!  Make yourself descent.  You have a visitor.  Gary, wake up  Patrick, just bring in here, careful now, that's right.

SpongeBob	Must have been Patrick is doing his night fits again. Okay I'll just close the window.  Mr. Wormsley!  Woaaaaahh! I'll just call for help. What ever you do don't move.
SpongeBob	Wait 'till Gary sees.
SpongeBob	I dunno Patrick. I've never seen Gary that upset.I guess we'll just have to find homes for each and every one of them. Right, Pat? Patrick?
SpongeBob	So, How many did you want?
SpongeBob	Uh, I'll just come back later, Mrs. Puff. Have a nice day!
SpongeBob	So I see.
SpongeBob	Well, yeah!

SpongeBob	"Aye-aye, sir. And who will be ""in charge"" while you're gone."
SpongeBob	Yahow!  I won't let you down, sir.
SpongeBob	Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal around here. I guess that's why Krabs put me in charge. Charge. Charge.
SpongeBob	Well, it's just that I'm in charge and...
SpongeBob	Well, I, um...
SpongeBob	Gosh, I'd love to, Squidward, but I've got to cook the patties.
SpongeBob	Yes?
SpongeBob	I know your secret...
SpongeBob	First off, this is my grill. This is where the magic happens! And this is my actual spatula!  So start fryin' up some patties! I'll come check on you later, my little prodigy!
SpongeBob	They are?
SpongeBob	Now that I'm in charge, I've decided to decorate the Krusty Krab! I'm gonna make it all pretty!
SpongeBob	Sounds like the Chum Bucket.
SpongeBob	Got it!  Gum under all the tables! How's that for low expectations?
SpongeBob	Squidward, all the customers are leaving!

SpongeBob	Uhh...
SpongeBob	I gotta help Mr. Krabs! Uh, Sandy, I gotta go to the, uh, gents room.  Now, if I finish up with Mr. Krabs, that'll clear me up to assist Sandy!
SpongeBob	"""Dear valued Tom's Toolery customers, we are closed this week in observance of Porpoise Day. Please call again."" Barnacles! Where can I find a motorized hex drill now?"
SpongeBob	Ha, ha! No, I haven't!... Have I?
SpongeBob	Yeah, here you are.  Sandy's drill!
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Your present?
SpongeBob	"No! I said ""The bakery delivers, isn't that handy?"". In fact, I think I hear them right now outside! Wait there while I go check."
SpongeBob	Uh, Sandy, I hate to delay the proceedings, but, uh, I forgot to mail in this mail-in rebate and, uh... I'll be right back.  Ok, let's get started.
SpongeBob	Never mind that, could I please borrow your present?
SpongeBob	I'm right here! This is trouble. I'm gonna get this leg of ham out of this contraption and take it home now.
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, buddy.
SpongeBob	Oh, he is good.
SpongeBob	Patrick.
SpongeBob	Patrick had a bloody nose, so I was going to walk him home.
SpongeBob	OK, buddy, I understand. Just promise me one thing.
SpongeBob	PATRICK!
SpongeBob	So it was your hat that was making you fall the whole time!
SpongeBob	Sure thing, pal.
SpongeBob	Whaddya wanna do today?
SpongeBob	Dolly?
SpongeBob	Ugh, there is just nothing to play with.
SpongeBob	Oh yeah!
SpongeBob	I got this.  Patrick! Patrick, get up...
SpongeBob	Ahem! La...
SpongeBob	What a great day! I hope it never ends!
SpongeBob	But they'll just come and kick us out!
SpongeBob	Thanks, pal. Well, we did it. Yay!
SpongeBob	"I said, ""Is that you?"""
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob	By... toys?
SpongeBob	No. We're going to fight back and we are going to win!
SpongeBob	Patrick, don't!
SpongeBob	The big shin-dig! Remember?
SpongeBob	Guess what?
SpongeBob	You know what this situation calls for. Patrick!  A few verses of the best friend tune! Ohhhh best fr-  Hey! Wait! This is not our stop! Oh, how are we going to get to the beach now, Patrick? We don't even know where we are.
SpongeBob	I do too, buddy. If only small plastic disc that you throw had a shorter, catchier name.
SpongeBob	Nonsense, Patrick. There are plenty of fun things to do in the sand. We can draw, or practice our cursive writing, or...
SpongeBob	Oh, a structure like that can't protect a king and his subjects. Here, let me help you. First, you should start all over.
SpongeBob	"All right Patrick, have it your way.  ""You keep to your territory and I'll keep to mine."
SpongeBob	But what for what!?
SpongeBob	Fine! Have it your way.
SpongeBob	Patrick... Patrick! Are you okay!?
SpongeBob	Ohhhh.
SpongeBob	Oh yeah? I bet you can't!
SpongeBob	Phew!
SpongeBob	Who's there? Stay back, I'm armed.  Woah! WOAH!
SpongeBob	Alright, I warned you!  You're a dirty fighter! Hmn, I gotcha now! Hi YA!
SpongeBob	Phew, thank goodness. For a moment there I thought you were hurt.
SpongeBob	Sorry about that. Oh, I know!  Here, just use a little tape and theerrre ya go, good as new!  Oh. Well, that's alright because we'll find a new shell for ya!
SpongeBob	Of course it's a shell!  Oh c'mon, don't look at me like that. .
SpongeBob	Oh, page 72. Oh, here it is. WOOOOW! . This stylish, fully insulated, dual coat ceramic shell comes with automatic restroom facilities standard, and for the affordable price of $9,595.95! Isn't there a place I can get a quality shell without spending a fortune!?
SpongeBob	Oh it's perfect! Just like the old one hey, buddy?
SpongeBob	Oops. Hey, what about that one?
SpongeBob	Well it... certainly is shiny.
SpongeBob	Whoops. Hey Jack I don't suppose you have any more to show me?
SpongeBob	Well, look on the bright side, I reduced your inventory for ya.
SpongeBob	Sorry, that's all I got, honest.
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary. How I wish your shell could grow back like my appendages.  Hey, I've got an idea!
SpongeBob	I know Gary, I ruined your life! DO YA HAVE TO RUB IT IN?!?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, perhaps you can help me find a new shell for Gary.
SpongeBob	Deal!  Oh, another bad dream.  Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	"I guess ""All's shell that ends shell. Huh, Gary?  Gary? Gary? Gary?"
SpongeBob	Five.
SpongeBob	Two.
SpongeBob	Ooh. Slide Show.
SpongeBob	Like that door?
SpongeBob	Well, Mr. K., we're back in business!
SpongeBob	...despair.
SpongeBob	Aww...what present did you buy your wife, huh? What'd you buy her?
SpongeBob	Your love.
SpongeBob	Say it with me. L...
SpongeBob	Llll...uhhh...vuh!
SpongeBob	Trampling enemies...  Now tell me about Karen.
SpongeBob	Ooh! a music lover, I think we have our solution you need to serenade her.
SpongeBob	Oh, you are ready!
SpongeBob	Oh, you just got butterflies in your tummy.
SpongeBob	Oh No! I've got to stop it before it's too late.
SpongeBob	The Plug.  Ha! You lose, Plankton.
SpongeBob	Yes! I'm Saved! Your wife exploded!   Um... Happy Anniversary you guys.
SpongeBob	Really? Oh, wow! Don't worry Mr. Krabs, I am a prom expert!  Oh Gary, I'm a prom failure. I couldn't even get a date for my own junior prom.
SpongeBob	Uhh, Pearl, we've got to get back to the limo.
SpongeBob	Be right there.
SpongeBob	Hi Pearl! Come on, it won't bite!
SpongeBob	That just didn't happen. Let's go!  Ready?
SpongeBob	Messed everything up.
SpongeBob	Can I still wear the wig?
SpongeBob	Ah, there you are, dummy! You sure come in handy! .
SpongeBob	Oh, Watch the potty mouth, Gare. Today is a day for gentle reflection. Aw, I remember my first visit to The Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Happy eleventy-seventh, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Oh, but Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Wow! Fifty cents!
SpongeBob	There we go.
SpongeBob	Yes! Yeah! Ooh, I almost forgot. Mr. Krabs, wait! There's one last decoration!  I present to you...  I present to you...  ... my ode to the Krabby Patty  made entirely out of ice.
SpongeBob	How do we get out?
SpongeBob	Don't worry Squidward. We'll find a way out and then we'll have the best eleventy-seventh anniversary ever. All we have to do is stick together.
SpongeBob	Look, it's Sandy!
SpongeBob	That might just be my hand, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Guys, its a dead end.
SpongeBob	You know, this reminds me of the time Mr. Krabs confided in me the Krabby Patty recipe. Oh, I don't want to bore you with my silly old stories.
SpongeBob	We wanted to make sure we weren't followed. Then, Mr. Krabs leaned in close and whispered the recipe.
SpongeBob	Oh. If only Sandy was here. She could help us.
SpongeBob	I do.
SpongeBob	Yeah!  Hello, Krusty Krab!   I'm ready, I'm ready to go to work.
SpongeBob	Ready!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, I don't want to give up.
SpongeBob	No.  As a battering ram.  Hut.
SpongeBob	And let's not forget the man who made it all possible. Mr. Krabs. What could be better?
SpongeBob	Oh, Krusty Krab, you've always been there for me. When I'm tired and hungry, I just reach out my hand, and there you are with a Krabby Patty that's all so hot and juicy. Are you with me people?!
SpongeBob	Did somebody order a Krabby...?  Whoa!  Look out. Oh. Oh, coming through. Whoa. Ooh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
SpongeBob	All ready to go jellyfishing today?
SpongeBob	Your never mind.
SpongeBob	Patrick, help me get these boards nailed up.
SpongeBob	Actually, I can't.
SpongeBob	Squidward! Did you come to weather out the storm with us?
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah. Hot cocoa... we'll be drinking.
SpongeBob	Squidward, welcome back! Here's your slippers.
SpongeBob	Patrick! What is it?
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob	Tie.
SpongeBob	Yeah, relax, Squidward. We're just here to have fun.
SpongeBob	Be the puzzle piece.
SpongeBob	Go, Patrick, go!
SpongeBob	Oh, it's okay, Squidward. We'll just start over.
SpongeBob	Please...
SpongeBob	Where are you going to get the chalk?
SpongeBob	Hmm. You may be telling the truth.
SpongeBob	This, I cannot allow. It's against the rules.
SpongeBob	Apparently so. Well, that and a refrigerator full of food anyways.
SpongeBob	Squidward, wait!
SpongeBob	2 orders of Chum Nuggets, please!
SpongeBob	Um, I guess you don't come down here for the food, anyways. You come down for the subterranean splendor of the Chum Caverns!
SpongeBob	"It's a ""stalagmiter"", available exclusively at the Chum Caverns Gift Shop."
SpongeBob	Order up Squidward!  I'll bet you're wondering why I'm not using my hands today.
SpongeBob	"So much for ""Work Without Your Hands Day,"" SquarePants. You answer to a higher calling this day. I have the capability!  OK, that's enough Patrick, thank you."
SpongeBob	Triton, Triton, Triton? Is there a Triton here? Is there anybody missing from this party that any of you guys can see?
SpongeBob	T-R-I-T-O-N. You sure you don't know anyone named Triton?  Should I put it down yes or no?
SpongeBob	Hey, that's it! I'll fix all this by reuniting Neptune with his son!
SpongeBob	What theI had the strangest dream that I just got hit in the head with a tiny toenail clipping.
SpongeBob	Who said that? Show yourself! I'm warning you. I know how to use these!
SpongeBob	You mean, you're King Neptune's son?
SpongeBob	You're right. It just doesn't make any sense.
SpongeBob	What if there was a way to free you from this magical cage? Then, you could come to your father's birthday party and settle your differences!
SpongeBob	boy this really does look complicated, oh I see, I'll just slide this square to the right, this one goes up, one other here and ohh wait, no, ahh, no squares  man that really is a tough nut to crack
SpongeBob	Oh Patrick, you made it, this is the magical lock I was talking about,
SpongeBob	Amazing!
SpongeBob	What's happened here?Hello, where is everybody?
SpongeBob	We better use the secret entrance.
SpongeBob	Only as long as King Neptune is locked up.
SpongeBob	Okay, now!
SpongeBob	Did you hear that, Neptune this was all because of me.
SpongeBob	Ohhh, yeah! Oh, limelight basking! Baskin' in the limelight!  Oh, good times. Good times.  So where will said basking take place?
SpongeBob	TV?
SpongeBob	Soundman...
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Who put you on the planet?
SpongeBob	Well, that's very nice of you to say.
SpongeBob	Under your tutelage, really? You mean it?
SpongeBob	Flabby?
SpongeBob	You know, Squidward, exercising's fun and all, but when am I gonna learn some ?
SpongeBob	Like that, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Yes, sir.
SpongeBob	And a-one, and a-two, and a--
SpongeBob	And a-one, and a-two...
SpongeBob	Coming over for a slumber party without even giving me a chance to put my best PJs on? I mean, look at these things. Just give me one minute to change, and when I get back, we can get started on some s'mores and popcorn.
SpongeBob	Oh, don't worry Mr. Krabs. I had a tooth pulled a few years ago. Only hurts for a couple of days.
SpongeBob	You don't have to do that. I know a special ingredient that can make one Krabby Patty taste like a million.
SpongeBob	La La La La La La La La! Getting Clean! La La La La La doo doo doo! Ohhhh, what a delightful day it is...  Noooooo!  Good thing I have a spare!  I still have one more thing to clean.  Ohh, what would I do without you, wringer? Guess I'd be all wet!  And now I'm ready to go to work!  You've gotta be more careful, SquarePants!  Always gotta be watching out for... things. Things like... ... that! Oh, I saw ya. Not gonna fool me this time, soap.  This is not going well.
SpongeBob	I hate to interrupt your reunion, but I kind of need your help over here.
SpongeBob	No Patrick. It isn't. How am I supposed to flip patties like this?
SpongeBob	Woo!  Don't worry Patrick! My spirits are still high!
SpongeBob	Aw, thanks, pal.
SpongeBob	Gasp! Not to worry, sir. I'm comi-i-i-i-ing--  Whoa!  Don't worry, everybody, I'm ok-  Hey! Don't touch Mr. Krabs' money!
SpongeBob	You were right! Ice cream always makes me feel better!
SpongeBob	Oh, dear Neptune! Why?!
SpongeBob	Good! Maybe now you know how I feel about you ruining my life!
SpongeBob	Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today!
SpongeBob	What's that? I can't hear you what with all the lonely voices in my head.
SpongeBob	I guess crying does solve your problems after all. Come here, buddy!
SpongeBob	Say, Sandy. You look...different.
SpongeBob	Let's get cookin'!
SpongeBob	"Ah, Sandy, 44-929b specifically prohibits the disclosure of the secret formula to friends, even when those friends are, quote, ""closer 'n two catfish in a skillet."""
SpongeBob	A Krabby Patty is cooked for exactly 283 seconds on each side.
SpongeBob	Okey dokey, but pay close attention, for cleanliness is the public's last defense against a life of horrible disease.
SpongeBob	Sandy!
SpongeBob	Or, we could address your problem areas directly. Are you struggling with the final wrist flick? Or is your difficulty with the initial transfer move?
SpongeBob	Wait, Sandy! We can work this out!
SpongeBob	Hey, where do you want this life-size cutout of you, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward, is that you? Oh, it's so dark in here. I can't see a thing.
SpongeBob	Then you grab yourself some lettuce.  And voil! One perfect Krabby Patty! Whoa. Watch your step, Squidward. It is pitch black out here.
SpongeBob	I said, could you speak a little louder, please?
SpongeBob	Okay!
SpongeBob	Do you know what today is?
SpongeBob	That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too, if you tried harder.
SpongeBob	No!  How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much!
SpongeBob	That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...
SpongeBob	What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless!
SpongeBob	I won't let Squidward win!  He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited.
SpongeBob	Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row.
SpongeBob	Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!
SpongeBob	Nope!  Nighty Night.
SpongeBob	Now to get some rest. Don't want to look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo!  Squidward!
SpongeBob	You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it.
SpongeBob	Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!
SpongeBob	Look, I'm putting my own money in the register, Mr. Krabs!  Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr. Krabs! Faster, SpongeBob, faster!
SpongeBob	Uh.. I'm not sure Mr. Krabs. I was bringing the customer's order, and then I slipped and fell in this grease slick. I think I may be hurt real bad.
SpongeBob	Yea!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, are you sure that was... legal?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, do you think it might be kinda... unhealthy to be feeding people all this grease?
SpongeBob	Sorry Mr. Krabs. I accidentally dropped some buns into our vat of extra grease. They've been soakin' there for about an hour.
SpongeBob	Actually, Mr. Krabs, I've been thinking. And well, don't you think maybe this whole grease thing has gone a bit to far?
SpongeBob	They're feeding people grease.
SpongeBob	You'll see!
SpongeBob	You're nothing! Is all that grime meant to scare me, Mr. Mirror? I've met sardines tougher than you are. Time to put you in your place.  Looking good, mirror! Sorry about the harsh words.  Now to attack these floors!
SpongeBob	Yep, he's gonna have to--   What? Let the little guy go?! Little guy? Who's the little guy? It must be either me, or  Squidward!  Phew! I  taller. You're the little guy, Squidsy!
SpongeBob	Squidward, wait!  We haven't measured with my legs at full extension yet!
SpongeBob	Oh, what's the use, Gary?  I've lost the will to go on!   Hi, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Oh, no I can't, Patrick. I lost my job today. I won't be able to buy food for you, or Gary, or for anybody!
SpongeBob	"I guess I'm not a carpenter, Patrick.  I need to start fresh.  With a job that feels...natural. Something that says, ""This is a job for a sponge."" Any idea where I can find a job like that, Patrick?"
SpongeBob	I...don't think that's physically possible,  BUT I could audition to be a sponge model.
SpongeBob	Wait! I can't do this, Patrick. What if I don't stack up to the competition? Maybe I should just beg Mr. Krabs for my old job back.
SpongeBob	Okay. Here goes.  Patrick, please?      Sorry.
SpongeBob	I guess a sponge  make it in this town.  I am going to be a star!
SpongeBob	Well, I better go home and get some beauty sleep.
SpongeBob	Patrick, when next you see me, it shall be on the television.
SpongeBob	Whoa! What's happening?  Wh-wh-what's happening?!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry. I don't think I'm cut out for acting.
SpongeBob	I heard you on the phone saying you were gonna let the little guy go. But I don't wanna go! Please don't let me go, Mr. Krabs! You're looking at the little guy that doesn't want to go.
SpongeBob	I'll help you Squidward!
SpongeBob	Please?
SpongeBob	Hi lady!
SpongeBob	First, close your eyeees!
SpongeBob	Ok! You can open your eyes now!
SpongeBob	I am angry? Squidward why are you angry?
SpongeBob	Like this.  Do you wanna try?
SpongeBob	Your very own statue!
SpongeBob	Poor little snail just wanted some fun time.  I can only image the tortured loneliness he must be feeling right now.  Welcome to the Kru...  Sorry sir, but the Krusty Krab has a strict no pet policy. I'm afraid your worm will have to wait outside.
SpongeBob	Just hang in there, Gary, Daddy'll be home soon.
SpongeBob	You're the best, Mr. Krabs!  Poor Gary must have been left alone. How am I going to keep him happy when they're not alone while I'm at the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	Oh yeah this is the one.
SpongeBob	Hello, Gary!
SpongeBob	Done!  Oh, enchiladas are hot hot hot!  Garold, it is not nice to ignore new friends.  Why don't you two play a little?  Great, now my enchiladas are cold.
SpongeBob	I accept your apology, Gary. Now, you be good to him. Good night.
SpongeBob	Mmmmm. You're making meatballs, Grandma? Time for dinner already?
SpongeBob	This is exactly what I was talking about...
SpongeBob	It's me, SpongeBob. I brought Gary along to help out.
SpongeBob	I've got an idea. We can buy it together and share it.
SpongeBob	Aren't you gonna save some of that for me?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't have any toys.
SpongeBob	I love you officially licensed Krabby Patty toy. Not too formal. Ah! I think I'll call you Patty Pal!
SpongeBob	Sharing?
SpongeBob	Of course.
SpongeBob	Nighty-night Patty Pal
SpongeBob	Gary, of course, Patrick will give me my turn with the Patty Pal!
SpongeBob	Patrick, it's me! SpongeBob! It's my turn to play with the toy!
SpongeBob	Well, I guess I had best be going!  I'm walking away. Here I go.  I'm gone now!
SpongeBob	I'm working out!
SpongeBob	Hand it over Patrick! I get to play with the Patty Pal today!
SpongeBob	Every half hour?
SpongeBob	One minute?
SpongeBob	Patrick won't share OUR toy.
SpongeBob	It takes understanding.
SpongeBob	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
SpongeBob	Did too!
SpongeBob	Aaaaaaannnndddd...
SpongeBob	...Krabs......nominated......award...award?
SpongeBob	Pa?
SpongeBob	My old man?
SpongeBob	Can do, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Aye aye, sir!  Here you are, sonny! A nice, shiny-  quarter.
SpongeBob	Twenty five, twenty six-
SpongeBob	Um, uh, ugh, uh... Mr. Krabs has always been very, uh... very...very red.
SpongeBob	Um, he's not doing it for the money. He is doing it for his loyal employees.  Vacation time, regular raises, profit sharing. To Mr. Krabs, he's such a little gift that he's to glad to give us, so that he can see the looks on our faces when he hands us our paychecks.
SpongeBob	Stealing? Phhhht! We're exaggerating!
SpongeBob	Sure
SpongeBob	Old Man Squidward's shed?!
SpongeBob	Yes, Patrick?
SpongeBob	We just wanted to play with your...  ...whatever this thing is.
SpongeBob	Ooh! It makes you look a thousand years younger!
SpongeBob	It's SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	That's odd. However shall I get in?  That's handy!  I am beat! Well, I don't have to take the stairs!  Ah. .
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'm here!
SpongeBob	La la la la!  I can't cook Krabby Patties! I don't wanna be a ghost anymore, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Living without a soul!
SpongeBob	But we want to be normal, now!
SpongeBob	Good morning Krusty Krab!  Oh.. Sorry Squidward! Didn't see ya there!
SpongeBob	Who is that Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	You got it, Squidward. Finally I have a clean place to store my toothbrush.
SpongeBob	Now I'd like to stand by and idly chat with you, Squidward, But I must attend to my Krusty Krab duties! In the future, please keep your interruptions to a minimum sir, please!
SpongeBob	I... expanded a bit.
SpongeBob	See?
SpongeBob	Item has temporarily moved during reconstruction. Relocated to shelf 10182-E.
SpongeBob	Squidward, what are you trying to say buddy?
SpongeBob	Call it a friendly gesture!
SpongeBob	Just two more minutes, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Aren't you forgetting something?
SpongeBob	Yes, yes, how did you guess?
SpongeBob	I jellyfish all da' afternoon,
SpongeBob	Superhighway!!!!!???? Do you know what this means??!!
SpongeBob	Larry, you gotta help me stop the highway!
SpongeBob	Captain Mr. Krabs, ahoy.
SpongeBob	Oh, Mr. Krabs! I just know that together, we can stop that nasty old highway from going right through Jellyfish Fields!
SpongeBob	"""Plan approved by & sponsored by Sheldon J. Plankton Enterprises, a division of No Fun Incorporated!"""
SpongeBob	Not that!
SpongeBob	Why?
SpongeBob	It means, you hate tambourines?
SpongeBob	But, my grandma gave me this sitar! It didn't come with a license.
SpongeBob	I know what a freedom march is, Patrick! I mean, what did he say?
SpongeBob	Thanks for the lift!
SpongeBob	I'm not ready to give up just yet!
SpongeBob	That certainly is a parade!
SpongeBob	I won't let you do it, Plankton! If you're going to pave over Jellyfish Fields, you're going to have to pave over me first!
SpongeBob	"Yeah, but this is more like ""highway excess!"""
SpongeBob	I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Zed-9er9er!!!???
SpongeBob	AND NOW I LOST THE ONLY JOB I EVER WANTED!!!!!!
SpongeBob	Ah! Now they'll have to listen!
SpongeBob	You're kidding, right?
SpongeBob	Sandy Squirrel!
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	Jelly lelly lelly leely, jelly lelly lelly jelly, it's the jelly fishing song!
SpongeBob	I said...  Ow!
SpongeBob	The Dirty Bubble's bubble wand!
SpongeBob	No thank you, Mr. Krabs. Uhh, does it have monsters in it?
SpongeBob	Excuse me, did his ship look like a Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob	The name's SquarePants. It's SquarePants!  I don't get it, Gary. Every Halloween, no matter how hard I try, everybody scares me.
SpongeBob	Why can't I be frightening for once? Where's my chance?
SpongeBob	I don't know Patrick.
SpongeBob	I don't get it, Patrick.
SpongeBob	I have a square head and a real ghost has a round one. All we have to do is make my head round and boo, I'm scary!
SpongeBob	What do you think?
SpongeBob	Do you think?
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, kill the lights!
SpongeBob	Hey, what do you know? I scared him!  It worked, Patrick. I scared everybody!
SpongeBob	Patrick! Guess what came in the mail today!
SpongeBob	Look out, Mermaid Man!
SpongeBob	Good morning, day!  Oww!  I stubbed my toe!  I stubbed my toe! I was walking around and I stubbed my toe!  D'oh, that was my favorite shirt.
SpongeBob	But the Krabby Patty fell on the floor and he
SpongeBob	Why?
SpongeBob	Boo! Hoo! Boohoo! Sob. Whimper.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Okay, great, thanks Patrick.
SpongeBob	All right, see ya.  Okay, it's a bet.
SpongeBob	I am not gonna cry. I am not gonna cry.  I can do this.
SpongeBob	Oh, well, sunset's over.  Nice of you to drop in, neighbor.
SpongeBob	Yes?
SpongeBob	Hooray!
SpongeBob	Let's watch something else Squidward, okay?
SpongeBob	I'd say... I'll go get some refreshments.
SpongeBob	No.  Time really does fly when you're having fun. Well, I'd better start getting ready for bed.
SpongeBob	That sounds like a very sad story.
SpongeBob	More popcorn, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff!?
SpongeBob	Help!
SpongeBob	It all sounds a bit mysterious to me. Oh but why should I care? I'm working with good old Mrs. Puff! Say, did you get my note?
SpongeBob	Shall we start with the importance of good kitchen hygiene or the unabridged history of the patty?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Mrs. Puff, you can borrow my notepad today!  Now, where was I... Oh yes! The total key is a bit sticky so you're gonna have to be forceful but not too forceful. Get it?
SpongeBob	Forgive me, I know not of this SpongeBob fellow. My name is Yukthomas Fydmuffin and I entered your place of business in hope to pro-clearing lunch on this fine day.
SpongeBob	Well, I see you have a little trouble getting in gear there, but you'll be in the fast lane before you know it!  Ah! Here comes another customer! Let's see if you can apply what you learned!
SpongeBob	Oh, Mrs. Puff!
SpongeBob	I can't begin cooking until the bell is rung.  Thank you! Although a smidge less rigorous next time please?  Order up! You done well so far student! Now all that's left is to deliver the item to the customer. Be cautious, but swift. Oh, I wouldn't go that way if I were you. It's faster if you go this way, Mrs. P. Look out for the barrel!
SpongeBob	Good day class!
SpongeBob	I'll never talk.
SpongeBob	Here you go, Pearl. Buy something pretty.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are both sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him? Isn't that taking it a little too far?
SpongeBob	Yes, I remember. But, I just wanted to tell that the secret formula is not, I repeat NOT, in the safe behind the painting in the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	But, certainly you wouldn't have use for such, innocuous information, would you?
SpongeBob	Because a hungry pod of whales have just arrived for its early feeding.
SpongeBob	Isn't this great Gary? A whole park full of your own species.  Go ahead, have a good time.  I'll just sit down here for a sec.
SpongeBob	Bon appetit, Gary, I made it with extra love.  Well it's not exacily what I had in mined but knock yourself out.
SpongeBob	Gary? Gary? Where are you, Buddy?  Snail Slime! Looks like could be Gary's.  Now for the true test.  Uh-hun. It is Gary's slime. I'm on the trail, Gary!
SpongeBob	Oh yeah. I supposed he wandered out of the house in the middle of the night just as though he can jump into your car.
SpongeBob	That's gotta hurt, Gary.
SpongeBob	Hmm! There's something missing. Ah!
SpongeBob	PEE!
SpongeBob	I'm on my happy break, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	And just look at your stylish new hairdo.
SpongeBob	And they would pay to watch a play, right?
SpongeBob	Hmmm. Now what will we call this eating dinner and watching theater?
SpongeBob	Huh? Um, ahem, ah...I...uh...I forgot my lines!
SpongeBob	Oh, what is this. A stray wrapper in my kitchen.
SpongeBob	Squidward, forgive me. I let the glamour of the stage distract me from my true calling: Making sure that every patty I prepare is the best it can be.
SpongeBob	Bless you all.
SpongeBob	Hark, Patrick. Do you hear something?  Oh!  Hmm, its a letter for Sandy, all the way from Texas. We better deliver it!
SpongeBob	Oh! I was twisting to the right.
SpongeBob	Championship title? For what?
SpongeBob	Perhaps the science fair, then.
SpongeBob	Oh, this is terrible! We cant let Sandy go all alone! Its too dangerous up there, right Patrick?
SpongeBob	Oh, Im sure someone else will help me.
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward! Sandy is in terrible trouble. Youve got to help me save her!
SpongeBob	Ooh uh. Well, theres one last person I can ask.
SpongeBob	Jeepers, itll only take a minute.
SpongeBob	Shes the squirrel.
SpongeBob	Sandys in trouble, and I need all of your help to save her from the horrors of the rodeo! There are clowns there!
SpongeBob	Whats that, boy? You see Sandy?
SpongeBob	To help save you from this rodeo thing!
SpongeBob	: La-la, la-la, la-la! La-la, la-la, la-la!  Yay!!  Threat neutralized, Captain. ... Roger. Over. ... Uh-huh. Right away, Captain. All hands, Repeat: Hi, lady!
SpongeBob	: I'm so glad you came back...  ...Double-Great Grammyma.  You're cold. Let's wrap you up in something nice and cozy.Okay, lean forward. There we go, now lean back, Grammyma. It's the coziest pillow I have. How about we look through some old family photo albums?Here's a picture of me when I developed my first appendage. Pretty neat photo album, eh, Double-G Grammyma?
SpongeBob	: Good mooorning. I'll go and fix us a nice breakfast, and then we'll spend the whole day together!
SpongeBob	: No, you couldn't possibly care about any of that stuff. Your life must be way more full and exciting.
SpongeBob	: Why are you not having fun?
SpongeBob	: Hmm... Hey, Grammy, do antenna run in our family?
SpongeBob	:My great-grammyma!She must be hiding. Well, she did say she was shy.
SpongeBob	: Grandma, I'm just gonna go make sure the restrooms are stocked. You, know, real quickit's part of my day-off duties.
SpongeBob	: Grandma, is that you? Are you all right?
SpongeBob	: Sweet dreams, Grammyma.
SpongeBob	I don't know. But when he does that he usually finds change.
SpongeBob	You said pets were not nothing but disease carrying vermins that should never be brought to the workplace.
SpongeBob	Done and done!
SpongeBob	Gary.
SpongeBob	I do?
SpongeBob	Mr Krabs is right. some of these rivets are off by as much as five nanometers. Well I better get to work.
SpongeBob	Okay. That's easy.
SpongeBob	Ah Ha! That should do it! Ahh. Time to check in with Mr. Krabs to see if he need to do anymore impossible jobs.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs. What have you done to my Gary? So this is what a hotbed of sin looks like.
SpongeBob	I'M NOT MAKING UP ANYTHING. I know all about you're little scheme! You're the one making up stories!
SpongeBob	You never what? Learned to use decent language?
SpongeBob	Cause it's a magnet! That's it Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Gary, this is even worse than yesterday.
SpongeBob	I would be delighted to meet him.
SpongeBob	Where is  home? Oh, maybe he doesn't have a home.
SpongeBob	Uh, Patrick, I don't--
SpongeBob	"Yeah, crushes. Patrick, ""crushes""that gives me an idea."
SpongeBob	Exercise time is over, Gary.  We don't want you getting too thin.  Here, boy. Fetch!
SpongeBob	That was this weekend?  I can't go! I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!
SpongeBob	I love Gary!
SpongeBob	Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand.
SpongeBob	Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?
SpongeBob	Gary! I'm home!

SpongeBob	Don't worry Gary, Squidward says I'll be fine. He knows everything. So, you hungry?
SpongeBob	No, no, Squidward's right. I'm fine. I-I worry too much. It's all in my head. I feel tip-top!
SpongeBob	Gary... I'm fine!

SpongeBob	Why don't you want me to pull out the drain plug, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	What if we get sucked in like those other two kids!
SpongeBob	Patrick, and I are trying to find the Main Drain
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs told us a story of how the Main Drain once destroyed Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	Patrick! We need to find that Drain!
SpongeBob	I hear ya' Patrick! Let's go find that Main Drain!
SpongeBob	Hmmmm...I have a better idea!  Well, what do you think?
SpongeBob	Ohh. How are we gonna find the center of the ocean now?
SpongeBob	WHAT?!?!?! Why would we do that?!
SpongeBob	But...if we pull it, and if it's real, the world may end!

SpongeBob	M-M-M-M-Mr. Krabs!  We're all out of Krabby Patties, sir.
SpongeBob	Scabs, sir?
SpongeBob	Good-bye, secret recipe!
SpongeBob	And that formula is...
SpongeBob	Ah, and that's the key to the box, eh, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	The Oceanic Express.  Wish me luck.
SpongeBob	Couldn't be better, butler.
SpongeBob	Hey Patrick, remember, we're on an important mission here. So keep your eyes open for any suspicious characters.
SpongeBob	Aw, what a cute little baby. No need to fuss, little fella.
SpongeBob	Oh, sorry, ma'am.
SpongeBob	Plankton! You stole the safety-deposit key.
SpongeBob	Well, if you didn't steal it, then who did? It must've been someone on this train. Patrick, call the cops.
SpongeBob	I sub--  I submit to you that the perpetrator of this heinous theft is none other than...the nanny.
SpongeBob	Triplets?
SpongeBob	Need I remind you, Plankton, that you are still a suspect yourself.
SpongeBob	The key! Patrick! Where in the ocean's depth did you find it?
SpongeBob	I'm trying. Sheesh, this isn't exactly a luxury suite.
SpongeBob	That'll work, too. Okay, on the count of onewhat the?
SpongeBob	There you go, buddy.  Oh, Plankton!
SpongeBob	That's just it, Patrick, they aren't there.
SpongeBob	What do we do now?  Oh, one of these thingama-hoozies has to stop the train. Patrick, try something!
SpongeBob	Oh, uh, th-that would be me. And Patrick's here, too. Say hi to the nice gentleman, Patrick.
SpongeBob	What is that?
SpongeBob	Sorry, oldsters, we'd love to stay and help you clean up the mess, but we've got a formula to save.
SpongeBob	Kids today.
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick.  Patrick! Call me!
SpongeBob	Patrick?
SpongeBob	Peek-a-boo! I see you!
SpongeBob	Ohh... Patrick, check out these roots!
SpongeBob	It ate Squidward!
SpongeBob	Somebody wants to play Tag!
SpongeBob	Oh boy!
SpongeBob	Must Dig! Ohhh! The rock's too hard!
SpongeBob	Cause you're so sweet... Get it?! Cause pineapples are sweet, and you are sweet also as well. Get it?!
SpongeBob	Oh, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick... my dear, dear friend. Karate is a delicate art, a skill that takes years to...
SpongeBob	As you wish, just remember one thing. With power, comes responsibility.
SpongeBob	Now this is very easy, watch closely.  Haa-haah. You got it?
SpongeBob	You're a natural! A karate genius!
SpongeBob	Ahhh... better luck next time.
SpongeBob	Good!  Oh man, I'm late for work.  See you later, buddy. Don't forget what I said.
SpongeBob	*Gasps* Dear Neptune!
SpongeBob	Oooohhh!
SpongeBob	Unhand my ankle, sir, my friend needs me.
SpongeBob	You gotta stop, buddy, you're destroying the entire town!
SpongeBob	Patrick, stop it!
SpongeBob	Pull it together, buddy!
SpongeBob	Hooray for regeneration!
SpongeBob	"Hmm, time to refill the tartar sauce.  Empty! I thought I'd never see the day. ""Use on or before the date printed below.""  This can has been here for 50 years. That's longer than me! Oh, important Krusty Krab relic, what shall we do with ye?"
SpongeBob	The peoples of the future must see this, so they will know how we toasted bread in the before time. So that they can understand the...
SpongeBob	You are the crown jewel of the time capsule!
SpongeBob	Ooh, are you sure you can part with it, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Patrick, you're very good at that!
SpongeBob	I know, but what are you doing?
SpongeBob	I don't know. We've got 50 years' worth of stuff to play with here!  It's our favorite game!
SpongeBob	Left foot on green.
SpongeBob	Sounds dreamy, Pat. What do you think the future will be like, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Ahh. Isn't this fun?
SpongeBob	Ow!
SpongeBob	Patrick, Squidward is really sad...
SpongeBob	Yeah vow
SpongeBob	Yeah, and considering neither of us have ears
SpongeBob	Good morning, Squidward! Wanna go jellyfishing?  Great! We'll be right over!
SpongeBob	How about now?
SpongeBob	How about now?
SpongeBob	Now?
SpongeBob	Sure we do.
SpongeBob	Well, he's not here. I'll bet that eager-beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields!
SpongeBob	But I spend the night so that I could... uh... Okay, I guess. .
SpongeBob	Sandy!
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs, today's my day off!
SpongeBob	Oh, Patrick, I tried, how I tried! But everyone needed my help and I, uh...
SpongeBob	It's true that I can't stand up for myself. I'm too soft! How I wish I had thicker skin!
SpongeBob	Thanks, Gary! You're always there for me! Huh, I wonder how this thing works.
SpongeBob	Hey Grandma.
SpongeBob	Why certainly, Sa-
SpongeBob	cause you're my best friend...
SpongeBob	Patrick! Patrick! Patrick Patrick Patrick!
SpongeBob	It happened again!
SpongeBob	Sandy, please help me! Gary ordered me an abrasive side so that I could be more assertive.
SpongeBob	Hold on.
SpongeBob	Owwwwww! AHHHHHHHHHHH!
SpongeBob	NOOOOOOOOOOO!
SpongeBob	Aye-aye, mein captain.Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo. I'm mopping and I'm singing about the Musical Doodle.
SpongeBob	It's a sign!
SpongeBob	Oh. Goodnight, sir.
SpongeBob	Of course. Yes, boss!
SpongeBob	Gonna listen again to the Musical Doodle!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I've tried and I've tried, but it keeps playing over and over in my mind.
SpongeBob	The song that you ran from is back again. You wonder if the madness will ever end.
SpongeBob	Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Yeah...?
SpongeBob	Well I don't know for sure how many I...
SpongeBob	I thought you said you didn't know how to play.
SpongeBob	What's that?
SpongeBob	Oh, Patrick, come on. Of course we can play!
SpongeBob	Never mind, just start counting.
SpongeBob	All right, it's my turn to count. You know what you're supposed to do right?
SpongeBob	Squidward!  SQUIDWARRRD!  SQUIIIDWARRRD!
SpongeBob	I'm playing hide and seek with Patrick and I was wondering if I could search for him in your house.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs up here!
SpongeBob	Oh, that one. I almost forgot.
SpongeBob	I'm trying to lift this boat. I think Patrick's hiding underneath it.
SpongeBob	Are you sure you're sure you're sure?
SpongeBob	Nope he's not under there. Thanks for checking under your car Mrs.puff.
SpongeBob	Wow. Are you sure it's OK for me to use this?
SpongeBob	I'm looking for my friend Patrick.
SpongeBob	yeah
SpongeBob	Well if he wins I lose.
SpongeBob	What's that?
SpongeBob	Patrick I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it.
SpongeBob	Yep, I just gave the last order to the last customer.
SpongeBob	You got it, Mr. Krabs!  Thanks, Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	We don't have an attic.
SpongeBob	When are we making this fresh batch of Krabby Patties, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Gary! I brought you a delicious treat!
SpongeBob	Ugh! you win, we'll bathe you in the morning!
SpongeBob	Gary! Your bath is ready!
SpongeBob	Prepare yourself for the scrubbing of a lifetime!
SpongeBob	Gary! You're turning green! And talking!
SpongeBob	Sooo, is that a yes or a no?
SpongeBob	Gary!
SpongeBob	Well, now that you can talk... I'm running out of time to say I love you!
SpongeBob	Now you just wait here, and daddy will fix you up that Krabby Patty I told you about. See you Gary...
SpongeBob	And this part ain't bad either! (gets out a cheese slice, inserts it into his body, and squirts it out of his holes in square slices)
SpongeBob	As I don the ceremonial white gloves, I can continue the eternal cycle and now deem the Krusty Krab...open. (turns the sign from 'closed' to 'open') Patrons, spring forth. (SpongeBob holds the front door open) The Krusty Krab will now seat you. (no one is there)
SpongeBob	Understood, Mr. Krabs. (raises his arm and takes a picture with his armpit) How do you like my new armpit spy cam, huh? Huh?
SpongeBob	You're right, sir. Who needs a spy pen when you are a master in the undercover arts? I blend in with the common man. Then, like a whisper, I am gone. (cut to Sea Chicken Shack where SpongeBob is in disguise) Yellow Scrubber to Big Red. Come in, Big Red.
SpongeBob	One of your finest sandwiches, please.
SpongeBob	No. Great barrier reef!
SpongeBob	Guess.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Word.
SpongeBob	I'm gonna be Squidward's assistant giant rock fetcher. (cut to later where Mr. Krabs is posing for Squidward)
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, if I may be allowed to float an idea.
SpongeBob	Oh, I've never seen those guys around before...
SpongeBob	Ah! Oh! We've got to warn Bikini Bottom about those creatures!
SpongeBob	Oh, hey Gary!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs! Ravenous sea whelks are terrorizing Bikini Bottom! They kinda look like Gary, but not really, and they spit purple slime! And they're eating everyone! They tried to eat me and Patrick, but we ran and we got away!
SpongeBob	We're not whelks! We're not whelks!
SpongeBob	Well, I guess this is end, Patrick!
SpongeBob	The gang's all here!
SpongeBob	Aww, cute. Ahhh... Ahhh... Ahhhh... Chhoooooo!  Excuse me!
SpongeBob	Oh, it is.
SpongeBob	Au contraire. After you, mon amie.
SpongeBob	No problem. Is your best friend right, or left-handed? The answer is right-handed.
SpongeBob	No need to peek, Patrick. I can do this with my eyes closed!  You haaaaaaaaaave...
SpongeBob	The answer is...beige.
SpongeBob	Next question: Does your best friend have an innie, or an outie belly button?
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	What shape is your best friend?
SpongeBob	Five seconds.
SpongeBob	Well, I am a boy, and I am her friend.
SpongeBob	After you, fellow single rider Pearl.
SpongeBob	And theeeen, there was that time that Mr. Krabs yelled at me for getting to work before he did, and he didn't even dock my pay. What a sweet man!!!
SpongeBob	PEARL!!! I wouldn't do that! You're not keeping your arms and legs inside the boat! Pearl! Wait! I should probably accompany you, ya know, in case there's anything in the darkness.
SpongeBob	Okay, Pearl, you've made your point. I'll stop talking about ogres, and vampire ba..bat fish, and sharks ,and...
SpongeBob	Or green beings from another planet!
SpongeBob	It sounded like a crawly were-clown.
SpongeBob	What was that?
SpongeBob	Look! Pearl, a sweet adorable charoff.  Pearl. I don't think this is the Tunnel of Glove. It's the Tunnel of Evil!
SpongeBob	CRAWLY CLOWN!!! CRAWLY CLOWN!!!
SpongeBob	MR. KRABS!!! This wiener tastes just like a Krabby Patty! Maybe we could add them to the menu?
SpongeBob	Squidward, what's that noise?
SpongeBob	Aye, aye Captain!
SpongeBob	Just make the wieners?  Um, excuse me Mr. Krabs? Uh, w-where are you going with that ladder? Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	No more Krabby patties...
SpongeBob	Where am I? And what are these paramedics doing here?
SpongeBob	And what about my my spatula?
SpongeBob	Has anything ever happened at your job that well, made it not-as-fun as it used to be?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Yea! Don't' you think we should  Krusty Dogs?! Those wieners have got to go!
SpongeBob	Here's your footlong, sir!
SpongeBob	We have got to get rid of these wieners and being back the Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob	Ladies and gentlemen! Allow me to introduce myself. I am but a simple, old timey gentlemen. I came here for 1 purpose today.
SpongeBob	Okay, that didn't work at all.
SpongeBob	Beautiful.
SpongeBob	Wait for it SpongeBob. Wait for it. Now!
SpongeBob	I think he's outside on his break.
SpongeBob	Tag, you're it.
SpongeBob	I'm it!
SpongeBob	Patrick!  I'm coming, buddy! Patrick?  Patrick!
SpongeBob	Oh, that's just my secret  Here you go.
SpongeBob	Uh, sorry, sir.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, do you think we gave away too much about our secret hideout?
SpongeBob	Hey, were you following us?
SpongeBob	Uh, you might want to take a closer look at your coinage.
SpongeBob	And why are there height restrictions on the cruit?
SpongeBob	Okay, but, would you mind keeping this worthless hunk of junk a secret? Wouldn't be much of a secret if we had a million people showing up!
SpongeBob	That was awesome!
SpongeBob	"""The Real Mauna Loa?"" Ooh, Patrick, do you want to keep a secret?"
SpongeBob	Hi-yah!
SpongeBob	That'll be the day.
SpongeBob	Sandy! Wait! Victory is yours.
SpongeBob	Oh yeah. Gotcha!
SpongeBob	Hi-yah!
SpongeBob	No, sir. Just practicing my karate, sir. Or kara-tay, as some call it.
SpongeBob	Hah!  Sandy!
SpongeBob	Sandy, wait! I can't. Mr. Krabs said I have to give up karate.
SpongeBob	Ahh, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Nothing. Nothing is fun about that at all!
SpongeBob	Karate sure is dumb.
SpongeBob	Me too. I don't know what anything is! In fact...
SpongeBob	What did you say?
SpongeBob	And one for me!
SpongeBob	Yeah?
SpongeBob	Or 10!
SpongeBob	Time for buns!
SpongeBob	Phew. Making sandwiches sure is fun. Right, Sandy?  Right? I guess I'll eat one now.
SpongeBob	I love kara-tay!
SpongeBob	"We were just posting Patrick's new ""For Rent"" sign. Did we work on it all morning, see?"
SpongeBob	Oh, thanks!
SpongeBob	Patrick, look!
SpongeBob	Hmmm. Our new neighbor must be really shy.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squidward. We can cheer you up.
SpongeBob	Just remember, Squidward. You've never experienced true love. BUT, that doesn't mean you'll never find it! You know the saying: There's a squid for every pot!
SpongeBob	Squidward, you've been bitten by the love bug!
SpongeBob	Oh, yes. He's just tired, you know, from all the hard work he's been doing around here. I so admire his work ethic.  So, what do you think? You want to date him?
SpongeBob	You betcha! He's such a charmer.
SpongeBob	You okay, buddy. You froze up there.
SpongeBob	Just meet me at my house at 5: 00, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Oh!  Missed a spot!  Aren't you going to compliment my outfit?
SpongeBob	No, you really shouldn't have. It's just that I'm very... I'm very aller... ACHOOO!  ...very allergic to tulips. So, are you ready to go?
SpongeBob	No, no, I've got it!
SpongeBob	Right after I tinkle.
SpongeBob	At that stoplight make a right.
SpongeBob	Now, it's the chit-chat part of the date. Amuse her with an interesting conversation.
SpongeBob	Squidward, could you please pass the roasted kelp?
SpongeBob	Squidward, wait! We haven't covered... We haven't covered all the tenants of  yet!  So, as I was saying... I, I would like to go over just a few more crucial aspects of the first date.  Such as...
SpongeBob	Does this mean there won't be a second date?
SpongeBob	Who's that?
SpongeBob	It's gonna be ok... you're gonna see her again... today... right... today? Come on... cheer up buddy. Hey, I'll make sure her visit here will be extra super special, no matter what!
SpongeBob	Oh, Squidward, you jokester.
SpongeBob	Squidward...wait, Squidward, w-wait! Before you do anything too rash, let me try to talk to them.
SpongeBob	Please don't.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control.
SpongeBob	Aw, she's something alright!
SpongeBob	Uh tit tit tit! Lab Partner!
SpongeBob	Yes, sir. The lab is amazing.
SpongeBob	Oh, I guess you won't be needing me any more.
SpongeBob	Do you think this is a good look for me? Or is it too flashy?
SpongeBob	Ooh, I gotta go to the bathroom.
SpongeBob	"Sorry excuse for a cash-?"" Oooooh! You mean Squidward."
SpongeBob	First aid? Fear not, injured co-worker,  for I am certified.
SpongeBob	Can do, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Not happening yet, but we're working on it.
SpongeBob	Why are you two always fighting? You were best palsie-walsies once.
SpongeBob	Bluh! That doesn't smell delicious!
SpongeBob	Nooo. There's a new restaurant down the street called the Flabby Patty, and now Plankton only wants to steal their recipe. Isn't that wonderful?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I think we're here.
SpongeBob	Don't you see? If you work together, the Flabby Patty recipe would be yours.
SpongeBob	Now, now, I think we all need to calm down. Fighting is pointless. You two would have the recipe by now if you only worked together.
SpongeBob	Look over there.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, what 'cha doin?
SpongeBob	Hey, look Mr. Krabs! That small hole in the wall just became a medium sized hole in the wall!
SpongeBob	Hi, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	How is this stuff better?
SpongeBob	One Krabby Meal! To go!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs. I'm concerned.
SpongeBob	Okay! Who had the Double Krabby Patty with fries and extra cheese....
SpongeBob	Squidward, are you sure!? These customers over here look really really hungry! .
SpongeBob	Going on down to Boating School! Boating School! Boating School! Going on down to Boating School! Rea de de la Mrs. Puff!  For me? Well on behalf on yours truly, I would like to thank each of you for such a wonderful and warm welcome.  Thank you.  Thank you sir.
SpongeBob	Then, who was it for?
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	Ok! Uh roll!? Roll!? Roll!? Is there a button for that!?  I know I know this! It's around here somewhere! I-
SpongeBob	Ok... just relaxing... and... relaxing! Relaxing! So hard!  RAW! I CAN'T RELAX!
SpongeBob	Be... cooool...  Cooool...
SpongeBob	None taken!
SpongeBob	SpoonggeeeBoooobb, Squuuaarrreee Paaannnttts!  Tony Fast Jr!
SpongeBob	OH WOULD I!?!?
SpongeBob	This one!
SpongeBob	Are you sure you're comfortable with me driving, though? I admit I'm feeling a little nervous...
SpongeBob	Faster?
SpongeBob	Thanks TFJ...
SpongeBob	However! Certain safety concerns prevent me from doing so! Therefore, I must decline!
SpongeBob	Grrr... GRRR!
SpongeBob	Huh? Oh no! The cops are after us! What are we going to do!?
SpongeBob	Now your dad is after us!
SpongeBob	AHHHHHH!
SpongeBob	Aw, how are we supposed to golf in this this downpour? Our putters are getting waterlogged.
SpongeBob	Oh, hi, Squidward. Up from your slumber, I see. Well, you're just in time to endure in a friendly game of  indoor miniature golf!
SpongeBob	Oh, don't worry, Patrick, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it.  Besides, we're just playin' for fun, right? And back, and-
SpongeBob	You know, Patrick, this is just a game.
SpongeBob	Shots.  They're called strokes in golf, Patrick. Not shots.
SpongeBob	Fine. Be that way. I'll just go around you. Oops.
SpongeBob	But remember what Squidward said? We can't make any noise!
SpongeBob	Patrick, have you seen by ball?
SpongeBob	Patrick, no!
SpongeBob	Play it where it lies.
SpongeBob	Patrick...
SpongeBob	Would you please get back in the game?
SpongeBob	But how are we gonna hit our balls back to my house from here?
SpongeBob	No, I mean whoever wins this hole wins the game.
SpongeBob	Rematch next Saturday?
SpongeBob	Hi, Patrick. How's your spring cleaning going?
SpongeBob	Order up! Careful with these ones, Squidward. They're special.
SpongeBob	Whoo-wee! Nothing like a hard day work at the Krusty Krab, eh, Squidward? Whew!
SpongeBob	Memories, doo doo doo memories, doo doo doo doo memories.  Hey, Gary.  Oh. Safe and sound!  Whoo, closed up tight! And you said it wouldn't fit.
SpongeBob	Who is it?
SpongeBob	Thanks for noticing, Squidward, and may I say that's a very becoming dress you're wearing this morning.
SpongeBob	Condemned? What does that mean?
SpongeBob	But isn't there anything we can do?
SpongeBob	No. I'll be strong.
SpongeBob	Goodbye, little friends. Have fun at the dump!
SpongeBob	Wow, four stingers.  Where have I seen this before?  Here it is!  Land squirrel.  That little squirrel is in trouble.
SpongeBob	I'm SpongeBob!
SpongeBob	May I try it on?
SpongeBob	Okay, see you tomorrow.  Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air?
SpongeBob	How's that?
SpongeBob	Hi-ya, Sandy. Its me, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob	Problem?  Hi-yah! That's how I like my air!  With no water.
SpongeBob	I cant imagine why.
SpongeBob	I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it...
SpongeBob	Air is not good, Patrick! Air is not good!
SpongeBob	Ah, time for bed, Gary.
SpongeBob	This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look.  Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is.  Gary! Huh?  Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...?
SpongeBob	What does that mean?
SpongeBob	Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now.
SpongeBob	I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper.  Going up! Eh?  I can make...  A million of me! Eh? Eh?
SpongeBob	Squidward!  Huh? Huh?
SpongeBob	So long, Squidward!
SpongeBob	This seems kind of dangerous!
SpongeBob	Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams.  H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs.  Uhh... Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Bye!  I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust.
SpongeBob	Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!
SpongeBob	Net ready, sir!
SpongeBob	Hey! Hey! I...!
SpongeBob	Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	Gary! Gary! No!
SpongeBob	Ooh!  Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud.  Ah...
SpongeBob	Gary and I are gonna try to win the prize so Mr. Krabs can fix up the Krusty Krab. Right, Gary?
SpongeBob	Hop in!  Come on, Gary!
SpongeBob	No problem, right, Gar?
SpongeBob	This is a dead end! >]
SpongeBob	What is that formidable creature?
SpongeBob	Oh, my! Well at least you bravely escaped out the tail.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I need a Gooey Worm!
SpongeBob	Karen?
SpongeBob	Sandy, please! Language!
SpongeBob	A little more, Gary!
SpongeBob	The only thing I can feel is my empty stomach.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Squidward keep those circuits warm. Patrick hang on!
SpongeBob	We're too late!
SpongeBob	W-wait big scary monster. Don't eat Patrick. Eat me packed with nutrients!
SpongeBob	Good morning, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Hey, here comes fun now!
SpongeBob	Oh, good morning Squidward! Yeah, Patrick here told me.
SpongeBob	You sure look grown-up with that new beard!
SpongeBob	Because some of your instructions in maturity will rub off on me! Bringing us TWO steps closer to a quiet, grown-up neighborhood!
SpongeBob	We do do da do do de!
SpongeBob	DOH!  Don't worry guys! I'm okay! Really! I'm okay!  There! Good as ne- ah! All fixed guys!
SpongeBob	That's it! It must be done!
SpongeBob	Patrick, don't leave me!
SpongeBob	Exit stage left is that away!
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	No big deal, SpongeBob, you just stand in front of them...  ...front of them looking...  ...at me  ...with their eyes!  Squidward is right! Public speaking is frightening!
SpongeBob	No, no, no, no, no, you can keep them. I just want you to watch me while I practice my speech up here.  Just pretend you're a student at his desk.
SpongeBob	Boating safe...
SpongeBob	I don't know. Do you think that's too much to expect?
SpongeBob	Patrick, nobody throws pillows in class!
SpongeBob	Wha, a detention slip?
SpongeBob	Patrick, somehow I don't think this is working.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, that's illegal, but she might be able to help me get over this anxiety. She's always speaking at science conferences. She's probably full of pointers!
SpongeBob	Huh...?
SpongeBob	Okay.  Uh, my report...is on...  Heh! Must be last-minute genders!  Patrick, where are those goggles?
SpongeBob	They're all staring!
SpongeBob	"--""for any minor delinquent actions under that teacher's care""."
SpongeBob	Hey, that happened to Patrick once. He must've been listening to hard rock.  He had a lump on his head
SpongeBob	I overheard you and Squidward playing doorslam and I wanted to see if I could get in to the next round.  Don't cry, Plankton. Doorslam is easy to play. Hard to master.
SpongeBob	"Hi, Squidward. I heard you and Plankton out here playing ""doorslam"" and I was wondering if I couldSquidward: Plankton stole my clarinet and I have to get it back!"
SpongeBob	He's right, officer. Plankton doesn't even play clar
SpongeBob	A beret? Oh, where can I get one?
SpongeBob	Do you want to make crafts too?
SpongeBob	Stick on a couple of googly eyes...
SpongeBob	You can do this!
SpongeBob	Oh! Oh! Oh, it's beautiful!
SpongeBob	How many lousy pieces have you sold, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Hiya, Patrick! Ordering up a delicious Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob	This is Mr. Tentacles. He'll be handling all your artistic advice needs!
SpongeBob	You got it, buddy!
SpongeBob	I'm so you all could make it! Tonight is going to be a magical evening filled with... magic!
SpongeBob	Patrick, those are hashbrowns.
SpongeBob	Ooh, a shadow puppet show!
SpongeBob	Pal, what you need is a vacation.
SpongeBob	Take a vacation at home. No packing, no travel, just do whatever you want to do. Best of all, it's free.
SpongeBob	Well, that's not the can-do spirit.
SpongeBob	Free tickets to what, Mr. Krabs?  You and a guest have won a week of relaxation on a luxury ocean cruise ship!
SpongeBob	Hey, me too.
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	Stand back, sir. Leave this to your trusty man-servant.
SpongeBob	I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy  I'm ready to ring Sandy's doorbell  Saaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnddddddddyyyyyy...!  Whoa!
SpongeBob	You're going on a moon trip?!
SpongeBob	Yes, I'm Number 12!
SpongeBob	No, Sandy! Wait! You can't go without your sheet cake!  Whoa!
SpongeBob	Oh, I just wanted to show you the
SpongeBob	Oh. Is that a bad thing?
SpongeBob	What do you think Sandy?
SpongeBob	Oh gee Sandy. I don't know. This looks kinda scary.
SpongeBob	Hey, this is kind of fun! [leaps, and bounces off the satellite, damaging it]
SpongeBob	Wait! I have to do something very important!  There!  So, we are going to make it, arent we Sandy?
SpongeBob	Are we gonna get consumed in a giant fireball?
SpongeBob	You called Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	La la la la la la la la la!
SpongeBob	Ow!
SpongeBob	Is it Bathroom Land? 'Cause I could really use a bathroom right now!
SpongeBob	Bill?
SpongeBob	Uh oh! I thought this might happen!
SpongeBob	I'm not sure how I feel about this sudden change!  Good one huh Mr. Krabs? AHHH!  Watch out Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs! It's ok!  The shredded money is recycled and turned into brand, new money! See?
SpongeBob	You too sir!
SpongeBob	Ah! It's raining Krabby Patties! Yeah!  A quick midnight snack and then it's back to bed.  Aww, sleep tight, my little angel.  Ah, here it is.  Nothing like a sea-nut butter and jellyfish jelly sandwich to get you to sleep.  The fridge!
SpongeBob	No, Gary. If I had the suds, I'd have bubbles coming out of me.
SpongeBob	I'm not sick. I'm going to work.
SpongeBob	No, Mr. Krabs, I'm ok, honest.
SpongeBob	Yeah, ok, Sandy, thanks.  Coming.
SpongeBob	It can't be as horrible as the suds.
SpongeBob	No, no! No stethoscope, no doctor, no old magazines, no hiss! No!  Patrick, I don't want to go to the doctor.
SpongeBob	No bubbles! Patrick, your treatment is working!
SpongeBob	Uh-uh.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Hiya, Sandy.
SpongeBob	I'm better, guys! Really!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Aah. Patrick, don't you love staring at clouds and thinking about what they look like?
SpongeBob	Um, Patrick, I think that really is a flying houseboat.
SpongeBob	Patrick, wait for me!
SpongeBob	Hey, this is a nice picture!
SpongeBob	Don't put yourself out for us!
SpongeBob	Gary!
SpongeBob	Oh, I didn't know you ghosts had gaskets in your heads!
SpongeBob	Patrick, after you!
SpongeBob	Eww, eww, eww, eww!
SpongeBob	The captain of the ghost gave us this doubloon and told us to buy him a new head gasket! And then, he took our souls and he put them in bottles and he said he's going to turn us into ghosts if we don't get that head gasket! You gotta help us, Mr. Krabs! I feel so empty without my soul!
SpongeBob	So here it is. Pretty creepy, huh?
SpongeBob	It's just us, Mr. Ghost Captain, sir. We brought the replacement gasket you asked for. So if it's not too much trouble, do you think you could give us our souls back... now... maybeee.
SpongeBob	I got it!
SpongeBob	Uh-oh. I don't like the sound of that!
SpongeBob	Ok, how are we on snacks?
SpongeBob	Thermometer?  Check. Ukelele, throw pillow, screensaver, incense, snail cozy, headgear?
SpongeBob	No...  NO!  No! This is terrible! How will we see the Origin Special now?
SpongeBob	We made it!  Patrick, get up! We have found the Mermalair!
SpongeBob	Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, we wanna know how this all started.
SpongeBob	Oh, this is it!
SpongeBob	The Krusty Krab is stowed and ready to slumber.
SpongeBob	Oh, you mean your obsession
SpongeBob	S-s-s-sad story! And so timely!
SpongeBob	Hi, Plankton, whatcha doing?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I think Plankton has really changed. He just needs some encouragement, and I know just how to do it!
SpongeBob	Yes, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Lalalalalalalalalalala!
SpongeBob	One time, my friend Patrick had this barnacle the size of an extra large Krabby Patty right at the center of his forehead! Anyway, I fixed it so we never saw that barnacle again.
SpongeBob	What did I say?
SpongeBob	Hypnosis? No! Hold still now.
SpongeBob	Oh... shouldn't be too much longer.  Personally, you could take a break off if you'd like.
SpongeBob	I mean, you're right. There's more.
SpongeBob	More for me!
SpongeBob	Pearl?  Pearl, you've been in the bathroom crying for three hours now. You can't stay in there forever.
SpongeBob	Well, I'm sure if I'll think strong enough, something will pop up.  Oops, I didn't mean it like that.  Hey, it's that delicious-smelling soap again.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, what is this thing?
SpongeBob	Ohhhh, that explains why it smells so familiar! I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. If Pearl finds out that you...
SpongeBob	Okay, you can stop. I think I have an idea...
SpongeBob	Shh. Trust me.
SpongeBob	I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't let him down, and I have partially fulfilled that promise.
SpongeBob	[using a woman's voice]Hi, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Well, I'll see you later, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Heh, yeah. Hey, Patrick, I need to ask a favor of you.
SpongeBob	No, that's not it! I am going to see my Gramma for her birthday, and I'm trusting my best pal to watch carefully over Gary when I'm gone.
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah. They're in the cupboard.
SpongeBob	You know what? You're right.
SpongeBob	Gramma, can I please use your phone?
SpongeBob	Sounds like you got everything under control. Oh, and make sure to give Gary his bath.
SpongeBob	And don't forget about the list!
SpongeBob	Just checking, is everything okay over there?
SpongeBob	Ooh, better get you to bed now. Good night, Gramma!
SpongeBob	Finished your breakfast already, Gare? You always were a good little eater.
SpongeBob	Hold it! I promised Sandy I'd take extra-special care of her treedome while she's at the Inventor's Convention today. And that is exactly what I intend to do. Patrick, this is a major responsibility.
SpongeBob	No way.
SpongeBob	Deal.
SpongeBob	Then what were you just doing to Sandy's collection of rare and fragile artifacts?!
SpongeBob	Mm-hmm. What else.
SpongeBob	Good boy, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Oh yeah, what makes you say that?
SpongeBob	I never thought I go out like this.
SpongeBob	, Patrick, and Sandy: Uh-oh!
SpongeBob	Wow. Kelpy's music is really, um, unique.
SpongeBob	Squidward, may I at least gaze upon your ticket?
SpongeBob	Me and a friend. Hmm, I wonder who that will be.
SpongeBob	Isn't this so much fun, Squidward? Wow, I love your Kelpy G wig, sir.
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	Alright. One lemonade, coming up.
SpongeBob	Hey, nice tune.  Nothing like a little accompaniment meant to bring out the genius of Kelpy's kazoo playing, huh, guys?
SpongeBob	Wow!
SpongeBob	Oh, well, you see, sir, we had backstage passes. But my friend ate them with his nachos, then he dove off the stage and got carried away by the audience.
SpongeBob	Ah, thank you Patrick.
SpongeBob	Hmm...
SpongeBob	Sandy, Sandy, check out these new spicy bubbles that Patrick invented.
SpongeBob	Oops.
SpongeBob	Hold on just a little longer, Sandy, we're almost there. I can see sunlight..  ...horrible dehydrating sunlight.
SpongeBob	Where's Sandy
SpongeBob	No Sandy, you need air, not food!
SpongeBob	Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll put them all back.
SpongeBob	That's good, but is it gonna be good enough? Mr. Krabs, you must have some spare Squidward always says you're full of hot air.
SpongeBob	You've got t.o help Sandy. She needs to share your air.
SpongeBob	I know. Wish me luck, old friend.
SpongeBob	Welcome back, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Woah...what was that stench?
SpongeBob	Gee...I wish I had a karate belt
SpongeBob	Um...sorry. I'm confused.
SpongeBob	Okay! Prepare to see the split of your life!
SpongeBob	My match!  I can't get outta here!
SpongeBob	Alright! Brace yourself Sandy! 'Cause it's about to get rough and tumble!
SpongeBob	Yes Sensei...
SpongeBob	Twenty! Got it Squidward!
SpongeBob	Sigh...You little Krabby Patties are so cute! Hmm...something's not right here.  It's the onions! They've gone bad!
SpongeBob	Grilling them now!  Your fries, sir!  And your fries, sir! Ketchup?  Oops!  Got it! Gasp! Fuzzy!
SpongeBob	Happy Valentine's Day, Bikini Bottom!
SpongeBob	Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm right behind you!
SpongeBob	Because it's not ready yet.
SpongeBob	Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, here we are
SpongeBob	It's not the quarter.
SpongeBob	Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Late? But what about...  ...Patrick?
SpongeBob	Well this is where you're gonna get it...I hope. Just keep looking out there, pal.  SpongeBob to Sandy, SpongeBob to Sandy, come in, Sandy!
SpongeBob	It's a handshake...a friendly handshake.
SpongeBob	You too, Dave.
SpongeBob	Yeah! Sandy's here! Woo-hoo! Look Patrick, it's here! It's here! The best valentine in the whole wide world is right behind you!
SpongeBob	Happy Valentine's Day, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Please keep Shiny away from sharp objects. We don't want him to go pop like his, late Uncle Raymond.  Oh, boy! Gary, did you hear that? They want me to watch little Shiny! I wonder when he's going to show up. The letter doesn't say.  Oh, I can't wait to meet him!  Oh, there you are, Shiny! Oh, look at you! You're just as cute as the dickens!  Upsy-Daisy! Say hello to Shiny, Gary.  You're full of soap and vinegar, aren't you? I can't wait for my friends to meet you!
SpongeBob	So, how was your trip?  You don't talk much do you? Hmm. Guess he's not home. Oh, well. We'll have to try again, later.  Hey, Shiny. Where are you going?  You can't go in there! You weren't invited!
SpongeBob	Okay, Shiny. Fun is fun, but it's time to come down, now.  Barnacles!
SpongeBob	I gotcha, you little rascal. I guess Shiny wants to be an artist, just like you.
SpongeBob	This isn't glass! Remember Bubble Buddy? Well, I'm taking care of his son.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, I got him! Wow, look how shiny Shiny made you.
SpongeBob	There you are, Shiny. I'm so glad I found you. Good thing you weren't hurt.
SpongeBob	Shiny! No! You can't go to the city. It's too dangerous!  Where are you, Shiny?  Shiny, no! Don't worry. I'll save you!  There now. Safe and sound.  Now, Shiny, I-  Now, Shiny, you might-  That was a close one. Okay, now. Let's get going and keep you away from sharp pointy things.
SpongeBob	"Shiny, where are you going?  ""Scissor Works""? Hold on, Shiny!  Oh, boy. Did you know scissors are sharp and dangerous? Luckily, we both escaped unharmed!"
SpongeBob	Here we are. Home safe home! You must be famish after all that running around. Now, what would a growing bubble eat? Hmm.  I know!
SpongeBob	Oh, he's...  ...doing great.
SpongeBob	Bye, bye. Anytime you need a baby-sitter. In case you wanna know, I do a lot of stuff. I have Gary,... he needs feeding... and I have to check in with Mr. Krabs... and I... stand around a lot, and that keeps me busy.
SpongeBob	Walking to work, huh, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Okay. Maybe tomorrow, then!
SpongeBob	I gotta do something.  Okay, Squidward, this should help.  Don't worry, Squidward, I'll catch you.  I can fix this.  This time I got ya.
SpongeBob	A present? For me?
SpongeBob	"Can you make Krabby Patties for loyal Krusty Krab patrons during ""serious jail time""?"
SpongeBob	Hmm... Here we go! 3 Krabby Patties, 2 large Kelpy Colas, and 3 fries ready to be served.  Hmm?  Oops!  Sorry about that Mr. Krabs! It's just so hard to get this food to Squidward without violating this restraining order.
SpongeBob	AH!
SpongeBob	Here you go.
SpongeBob	Uhh, Patrick gobbles down the patties. Num num num num num.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs doesn't think my ideas are helping.
SpongeBob	Ohh, what is this?
SpongeBob	Plankton, you've stolen a priceless work of art. There's only one thing you can do.
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	I can't believe you're calling me that!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I think I have the solution.
SpongeBob	Ooh!
SpongeBob	Squidward, you don't have a happiest memory?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squidward, I'll help you make a happiest memory.
SpongeBob	Then this will definitely be your happiest memory!
SpongeBob	Well, you love art. Maybe you'll find a happiest moment in here!
SpongeBob	Um... it's kinda smokey in here!  You need fresh air!
SpongeBob	Oh! Sorry Squidward! I'll take us down!
SpongeBob	Why isn't he answering?  Squidward! Squidward! Now I'm really worried! Squidward! SQUIDWARD!  Gasp! Squidward! Down here! He's upstairs!  Hey! Hey! Squidward!  Well at least we know that he is still alive. Uh oh...  I'm okay Gary!
SpongeBob	Hi Squidward!  You sure are a hard man to get a hold of!  Hey, do I smell brownies?
SpongeBob	So you enjoying the d'oevuers?
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick. I'll go see if there are any jellyfish in that creepy, scary, evil-looking cave over there.
SpongeBob	You don't suppose this is some sort of new breed, huh?  I think I'll keep this one as a pet.  Whoa!
SpongeBob	Hah, back at ya good buddy.
SpongeBob	Aw, look at him, the little angel. Guess he couldn't make it past the third feature.  Good morning sleepy-head. We wouldn't want anything to happen to you while I'm at work.  You better stay in here where it's safe.  You two stay out of trouble, bye!
SpongeBob	I saw that movie last night, too. Whoops! If you're going work here, you're going to need an official Krusty Krab hat.
SpongeBob	Ha ha...uh, no thanks.  Ah! Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	I'm no clone, Sandy! I am SpongeBob!
SpongeBob	Oh, so you don't like mayo? Just like a Jellien!
SpongeBob	Uh huh! Sure did!
SpongeBob	Oh, hi Jellien Patrick!
SpongeBob	Aye, aye!  Oh no! This mayonnaise is frozen solid!
SpongeBob	I'm off to work, off to work, getting ready for flipping.  Those customers can't get enough Krabby Patties. Settle down folks: I'm here; I shall have your Krabby Patties before you shortly.
SpongeBob	I don't know, but we have do something to turn this situation around.
SpongeBob	We simply give Krabby Patties away for fr-
SpongeBob	I do.  Free Krabby Patties! Get your totally and completely free upcharge Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob	Squidward, here's your cup like we rehearsed.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, we'll fix this.
SpongeBob	All new free Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob	Oh, money angels, can I make one?
SpongeBob	Just a little handyman's know-how is all it takes, Gary!
SpongeBob	Patrick! Patrick! Patrick Star!
SpongeBob	Hurry, Patrick! I don't know how much longer I can hold this!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I know. I'm sorry, but my hou...
SpongeBob	A week of my wages per hour?
SpongeBob	Uh, that's not exactly what I had in mind, Sandy...
SpongeBob	But, the sofa goes there.
SpongeBob	Yeah, but I kind of liked my pineapple the way it was. I don't need all these fancy-
SpongeBob	It's, uh...
SpongeBob	Well, Gary. Here it is. Our new home.  Hmmm. This must be Patrick's contribution to the living room. Hey, vintage condiment jugs! Thank you, Mr. Krabs!  Yaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!  Gary, where's the sink?!
SpongeBob	Well, this isn't exactly home sweet pineapple, but I suppose it could be much worse. We still a roof over our heads and food on the table. Hey, that reminds me! You still haven't eaten today, have you? Sorry, buddy. You must be famished.
SpongeBob	Yes, the end.  Quitting time is almost too much to bear.
SpongeBob	This isn't a pile of trash.  It's a free computer system.
SpongeBob	Yeah, I think so.
SpongeBob	Careful, Mr. Krabs. This still could be a ruse. Karen's loyalty maybe still be with Plankton.
SpongeBob	No, putting in a hard days work at the greatest job in the world: The Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Sure thing.
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Insomni-what?
SpongeBob	Yes, sir.
SpongeBob	This pillow is as hard as a rock!
SpongeBob	Now, that should do the trick!
SpongeBob	Ooh! A bedtime story!
SpongeBob	What are you doing? And what kind of a bedtime story is that?
SpongeBob	Patrick, this isn't...
SpongeBob	Patrick! This isn't help either!
SpongeBob	I appreciate your efforts, but we gotta keep trying buddy.
SpongeBob	Hey, That wasn't half bad. What was that anyway?
SpongeBob	Ahh! Sea troll! Huh? Just a shrub. Keep going till you crash SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Sir Cecil, The sea sleep king!
SpongeBob	You're right Mr. Krabs, How could I be so forgetful?
SpongeBob	I'm sorry Mr. Krabs, I tried, I really really tried! But my insomnia got the best of me!
SpongeBob	I love it. What do you think of this? Awoo!
SpongeBob	Why, is there something wrong?
SpongeBob	No faces... at all. Yeah. This is...  easy. How you holding up?
SpongeBob	Guess, Mr. Krabs made a mistake. Well, now that we know his tall tale isn't true. Let's make lots of faces.
SpongeBob	Doy doy doy doy!
SpongeBob	Day ah dah da dah!
SpongeBob	Let's not keep these grotesque faces to ourselves. Let us share then with the whole wide sea.
SpongeBob	: Your Turn Squidward let's see your Crazy Face.
SpongeBob	Wow Patrick, you did hold that face all night!
SpongeBob	Patrick, Sandy was right, we need help!
SpongeBob	: Doing fine Mr. Krabs. Just grillin and grillin.
SpongeBob	: On it Squidward!
SpongeBob	: Phew. Order up.
SpongeBob	: Why, oh, why, why did I have to make a face?
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, we thought it was one of your stories.
SpongeBob	Squidward! Squidward, wait!
SpongeBob	Garbage?! But, Squidward, in the right hands, this paper is a gold mine of entertainment. A spectacular afternoon of underwater fun. A treasure trove of...
SpongeBob	You sure?
SpongeBob	Last chance to change your mind, Squidward.
SpongeBob	La, la, la, la, la. Gary, watch this!  Guess what I am.
SpongeBob	Ugh. SpongeBob JunglePants summon animal friends.
SpongeBob	Isn't this great? La-la-la-la-la...  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
SpongeBob	La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
SpongeBob	Yeah, see, you're playing it like this...  ...when ordinarily it goes like this...  I'm partial to doing it in the key of A-minor myself.  Ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Sure you did, Squidward, look.
SpongeBob	Wow, pocket lint!  You drive a hard bargain, Squidward. Paper for lint, hmmm...
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	Squidward's shirt. I've always loved that shirt. Okay, okay, I'll trade!  I can break a promise for this. Squidward, do you want your other stuff, cause this is all I'll need?
SpongeBob	Close Glove World!? Has the world gone mad?!
SpongeBob	But Patrick, it's Glove World!! They're gonna...
SpongeBob	Uh-huh, come on. Excuse us sir, we heard a horrible rumor that you're gonna close Glove World! forever.
SpongeBob	You can leave a glove to glove, but you can't make it glove.
SpongeBob	Oh, please Mr. Soon To Be Ex-owner of Glove World!. Could you see in your heart, to let us ride all our favorite rides? Just one last time.
SpongeBob	I know Patrick but we have to be brave.  Where to next Patrick?
SpongeBob	Ew, did you hear that?
SpongeBob	Uh-huh.
SpongeBob	Nice job Patrick.
SpongeBob	All I'm saying is maybe there's a reason Glove World! is closing. I mean just look around you, open your eyes.
SpongeBob	Wait a second.  That's it!
SpongeBob	Okay Patrick, this is it you remember what to say?
SpongeBob	Ow!
SpongeBob	Patrick, Stop! What are you doing?
SpongeBob	We're doing what any concern responsible person does when they're left no other choice.
SpongeBob	The key that I gave you. The key that unlocks these chains.
SpongeBob	Look at it this way Squidward: Things could always be worse.
SpongeBob	Being sick is awful! The aches, the running nose, and the fever are bad enough. That's not even the worst part.
SpongeBob	What's the matter?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Squidward, but I think the best thing for someone in your condition would be to  go home and not come back until you're fully recovered.
SpongeBob	Yes.
SpongeBob	Oh, this is a precautionary measure in case anyone in the workplace happens to fall ill, which in this case you have. I wear it to protect my body from spreading germs and bacterias.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Who was the first?
SpongeBob	My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is...  My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is...  That's funny. My eyes feel itchy.  And my throat feels scratchy, too.  Itchy eyes, scratchy throat...  even my mouth feels dry!  I've contracted... Squid's Disease!
SpongeBob	Yes, everything's fine in here.  Just dandy.  I better conceal these unslightly blemishes or Mr. Krabs will get suspicious.  This super hot spicy yellow mustard should do the trick. No, actually that burns real bad.  Stay calm. Just need to cool it off. Cucumber! Cucumber will cool it off! We'll just need to find some  pickles! Pickles, they're like cucumbers. Sweet relief, here I come.  Sweet vinegar, it burns! It burns! It burns!
SpongeBob	But who's going to run the restaurant?
SpongeBob	That seems like a great idea, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Oh, don't worry. We have all 99 sequels to watch next.
SpongeBob	But Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here lying on the floor?
SpongeBob	Don't wish me luck, Squidward, I don't need it.  What do you say, Mrs. Puff? Let's get this party started.  I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff, I know what I did wrong.  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff, I got it this time.
SpongeBob	Hm, from now on I guess we'll have to call you Mrs. Pop!
SpongeBob	Sheesh! I don't know what she is so upset about! I think she looks better this way! If I always say, it's duh doy.
SpongeBob	Ah this room is so dark and depressing! You need sunlight!
SpongeBob	Excuse me! Doctor! What's up with those guys?
SpongeBob	Look out extra credit! Here I come!
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff! What should I...
SpongeBob	"Mrs. Puff! It's you! And you're all ""puffy"" again! Now everything's back to normal!"
SpongeBob	Ooooh.
SpongeBob	Gary, I'm home!  Oh, Gary! You've got a big surprise coming to you.
SpongeBob	Does somebody want another Snail Bite?  Can somebody roll over?  Roll over.
SpongeBob	Well, I can't say no to my wittle Gare-Bear
SpongeBob	Golly, Mr. Krabs, what if Plankton guesses right and wins a  Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob	Nope, she's perfectly aligned.
SpongeBob	I'll do my best, sir.
SpongeBob	Huh, good thing I ordered us extra b-- for the contest crowd.
SpongeBob	Take a look.
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward? What are you doing today?
SpongeBob	Ooh. Baited with Christmas treats?
SpongeBob	Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me. Hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready for Christmas?
SpongeBob	Ooh! Ooh! HOT! HOT! HOT! Wow! This is great!
SpongeBob	No. I feel just how this cake tastes! Absolutely delicious!
SpongeBob	Well   I think everyone should taste your amazing fruitcake!
SpongeBob	I knew you'd like it.
SpongeBob	Everyone can get behind a mouthful of warm sunshine, everyone eat a Christmas time clich.  Everyone can get behind a mouthful of Christmas time, let's all eat some hot fruitcake today!
SpongeBob	Merry Christmas, fellas!
SpongeBob	Yeesh, OK. Don't have to be a jerk about it. Everybody's on edge today. Must be the holiday jitters.
SpongeBob	Oh gosh, what do I do now?
SpongeBob	Because those jerks don't care about Christmas any more, Sandy! It's a problem.
SpongeBob	From Plankton, he baked it.
SpongeBob	Oh! I've eaten tons of that fruitcake! I must be the biggest jerk in town!
SpongeBob	Bring joy to the world, it's the thing to do, but the world does not revolve around you. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! Be nice to babies and animals, old folks, too. 'Cause that's how you'd like them to treat you! Use turn signals. Don't screen my calls. Don't you wreck the house when you deck the halls. Spit your gum where it won't wind up on my shoe. Squeeze toothpaste from the bottom of the tube. Don't be a jerk.It's Christmas! It's Christmas!
SpongeBob	Oh, boy! Santa! You made it!
SpongeBob	But---!
SpongeBob	Is that all you got?
SpongeBob	Hey, has anyone seen Patrick?
SpongeBob	Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Hey, this is great!
SpongeBob	Squidward? Hey, Squidward? Squidward?
SpongeBob	Oh, wow! You've been busy, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Mr. Krabs! I'll promote the Krusty Krab and I know just where to start!
SpongeBob	Thanks, sir! Tell all your... friends. Krusty Krab! Eat at the Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob	Yeah, I guess..so.
SpongeBob	That tickles!
SpongeBob	Ready!
SpongeBob	Huh?  Aaaaaaaahhhh!
SpongeBob	I think the ad campaign is going really well.
SpongeBob	Yeah, but how do we find that last 1%?
SpongeBob	Tartar sauce!
SpongeBob	Oh, boy! Here they come!  But they're not happy! We'll be bombarded! Patrick, help me hold the door shut!
SpongeBob	Hello, Mrs. Puff!
SpongeBob	Speaking of signatures, would you sign this petition to save the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	Sir, where did you get this?
SpongeBob	Don't thank me, Mr. Krabs. Thank the Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	Three-Headed Jake? He comes in every day.
SpongeBob	So you're not gonna destroy the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	Boy Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.
SpongeBob	I cleaned the tables Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, you gotta...
SpongeBob	But, Mr...
SpongeBob	Pirates?
SpongeBob	Ow.
SpongeBob	Okie... oops.  I mean...  arrgh! Captain Krabs.  Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh...
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, we're tired.
SpongeBob	But we've only been gone a few hours.
SpongeBob	Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.
SpongeBob	No, guess there isn't.  Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself.
SpongeBob	Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!
SpongeBob	We got it Captain Krabs.
SpongeBob	What about loyalty?
SpongeBob	And one for all.
SpongeBob	Kind of sounds like Squidward's practicing his clarinet over there. Doesn't it, Gary? Gary? Well, I can't just stand by and let him practice alone. Then what kind of a friend and neighbor would I be? Not that kind that I... ...would want.
SpongeBob	"And when I heard the word ""Team"" which is special to meeee! 'Cause through the power of music there's no way we won't get. The bond together with this special duet!"
SpongeBob	The Krusty Krab's not there anymore!? Where'd it go?
SpongeBob	Isn't this the most exciting experience in your entire life Squidward?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Patrick, why didn't you just ask me?  You know I always bring tiny, snack size tires for in-between meals! You know, I'm kinda hungry now actually.  Hmm...Squidward? They're fat free!
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	This is the part where I stand up and play!
SpongeBob	I'm ready!
SpongeBob	Sure thing, buddy.
SpongeBob	Whoa!
SpongeBob	Look out!
SpongeBob	No problemo. I guess you just hop up like this...  Hey! Come back!  Heeeeyyy!
SpongeBob	I am of course.  Hi Patrick!
SpongeBob	Extreme!
SpongeBob	Noo! It's dry-clean only!
SpongeBob	Well, there is a very extremely extreme sport we play if you're up to it.
SpongeBob	What am I gonna do with you? I can't throw you away.  Bleh!  But I do have to throw away the trash.
SpongeBob	Let's see. Ooh. World's longest tongue.

SpongeBob	Oh yeah. Well, how about this, baby?
SpongeBob	Well, I don't know, Patrick. He isn't looking so good. We should take him to a doctor. Come on let's take him to the hospital.
SpongeBob	Ok. Time to lighten things up. Do you like games Squidie.
SpongeBob	Hooray. Huh. Squidward!  Squidie are you ok?  We need to do a better job of protecting him.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, Squidward is in no condition to perform his Krusty duties.  The poor guy has the mind of an infant.
SpongeBob	Remember, buddy! I'll be right behind you!
SpongeBob	Squidward! Yelling at a poor, defenseless baby! You oughta be ashamed!
SpongeBob	Sorry!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, if my poopy baby isn't welcome here, then I'm not staying either!  Squidward!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Squidward! I was gonna change it, but I got in the wra...
SpongeBob	Nothing.
SpongeBob	Oh, I've made a mess. And that means......Cleaning Time!  MY EYES!!!  My spray... Oh no, it rolled......beneath the grill!  I can do this.  Nope!  Ah ha! Gotcha!  An urchin!
SpongeBob	Help!
SpongeBob	There it is!  I'll get it!  Got it!
SpongeBob	Phew! That was close! Thank goodness no one noticed the urchin...
SpongeBob	Uh...Mr. Krabs...
SpongeBob	Spoon.
SpongeBob	Don't worry Plankton! We're behind you one hundred percent!
SpongeBob	Ok, I'm ready!
SpongeBob	How's this Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Is this far enough?
SpongeBob	Let me get my wallet.  Wait, let me check this pocket.  No...  Patrick, do you have any change?
SpongeBob	Lemme check my other poc-
SpongeBob	Ok! Here's my glove light.
SpongeBob	Yeah, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Patrick, I think we're on the wrong  ...bus!  But sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	Uhh, uhh, ok. You wait for the bus. Call me when it comes and I'm gonna get a bus schedule.  Boy, this place sure is creepy.
SpongeBob	Finally! Yes, I'm next!  When is the next bus to Bikini Bottom?
SpongeBob	Oh,  no...  you don't.
SpongeBob	Who's there?  Well, I guess that spot will be there tomorrow. I better just keep walking.  Running! Better start running! Running!  Sprinting! I just gotta keep sprinting!  Sitting, sitting. Bleeding.  Hey, who's there?  Ok, that's enough.  Don't come closer.  I'm warning you!  I'm a sponge!  Oh, it's only you.  Well, that solves my balloon problem, but I have a bigger problem.  I'm kinda stuck here. I need to catch a bus to get home. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Balloon...  has...  enough...  air...  thanks.  Hey, I get it, balloon travel. Thank...  you!
SpongeBob	Oh. I'm just practicing my karate chops. I'm going to have  an intense karate session with Sandy later. Sandy says you never know what creepy creeper could be creeping creepingly around any creepy corner.
SpongeBob	Oh wait, I don't get it.
SpongeBob	I was? About what?
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	See see ba ba!
SpongeBob	HIYAH!
SpongeBob	BLOCK!
SpongeBob	Sandy! Wait! Please! Help him! He just want to keep his organic, blue algae safe.
SpongeBob	YEAH YEAH! Now try this!
SpongeBob	For shame, Squidward. For shame.
SpongeBob	Look! They even gave me a training baton!
SpongeBob	Tsk, tsk, tsk. Someone didn't finish their beans!
SpongeBob	MR. KRABS!!!
SpongeBob	And you win again!
SpongeBob	How much do we need?
SpongeBob	Well, my dependable spatula, shall we?
SpongeBob	I'll never forget you.
SpongeBob	Well, I've never even heard of that model.
SpongeBob	Wow. This is the greatest spatula collection on the whole sea floor.
SpongeBob	These orders have really piled up.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs said he'd put me in a padded kitchen if he caught me talking to you.
SpongeBob	Oh?  Wow, pretty good. But we're a long, long way from filling all these orders.
SpongeBob	Wow, SizzleMaster, you truly are magical. We're catching up. But we got an empty grill here.
SpongeBob	Unlikely. But a spatula can dream. See you tomorrow.
SpongeBob	Oh. Hey, do you clean snail litter boxes?
SpongeBob	Whoop!
SpongeBob	Well, don't mind if I do.
SpongeBob	Charred Krabby Patty bits? SizzleMaster, what happened?
SpongeBob	Oh, my new magical talking spatula that I got from Plankton says it needs your Krabby Patty secret formula.
SpongeBob	One sack coral dust, extra spicy. One bucket fire algae paste. And the final ingredient, disulfide.
SpongeBob	Yes, Patrick?
SpongeBob	These weird bubbles saved us.
SpongeBob	Fascinating. Tell us more.
SpongeBob	See you later, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Look!  Giant goo bubble!
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah. Gross. Good thing I keep a spare set of hands.
SpongeBob	Look out!  Hang on, buddy! Just a little bit more!  Gotcha!  I don't gotcha! Whoa!
SpongeBob	Oh, no! It's headed right for Neptune's trident!
SpongeBob	Rude!
SpongeBob	Tough guy? Bubble? Patrick! Eureka! Inspiration!
SpongeBob	Prepare to meet your match, you big, bubble bully!
SpongeBob	Oh, that dirty little double-timer!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Squidward! I can't find Mr. Krabs and he said he'd be right back! I'm getting a little concerned...
SpongeBob	Pearl, I hate to be the one to tell you this but Mr. Krabs is missing!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs? Are you okay?
SpongeBob	I gotta save Mr. Krabs!  Patrick! Patrick, you gotta help me, buddy! I need to break into a bank!
SpongeBob	A bunch of old shoelaces?
SpongeBob	Not now, Patrick. We're running out of time. And more importantly, Mr. Krabs is running out of oxygen.
SpongeBob	Ah. Yes, I need to make a withdrawal. I need to withdraw one Mister Krabs!
SpongeBob	It's
SpongeBob	Sorry.  So, this isn't too scary.  The Fisherman's hook! Get off the teeter-totter!
SpongeBob	One... minute... to midnight?!
SpongeBob	No. No, you don't. I'm gonna walk you to your door.
SpongeBob	Thank you, Squidward. You are a true friend.
SpongeBob	Who's here? Hold on, let me get up.  Your face!
SpongeBob	The Fisherman!
SpongeBob	: Oh yeah. Just like the movie. (they close their eyes, later open them to see Squidward behind them)
SpongeBob	Sorry, Squidward. I just never seen a sance before.
SpongeBob	Ooh.
SpongeBob	Good night, bossman. Patrick and I will lock up.
SpongeBob	As consort to the spirit world, I know commence this sance! I shall invoke the specter of Rusty Rickets by reading from . . I now summon the spirit of Rusty Rickets!  Know, too, that I beckon the spirit of Rusty's Rib-Eye!
SpongeBob	Uh, he means freak in the nicest possible way. Alright, enough of this hocus pocus hooey. Time to put in some work!  Say, uh, Rusty, how about spilling the beans for the old Rusty on Rye recipe?
SpongeBob	Whoa! Gee, Rusty. What a setup you got here. But where's all the sandwich bread, the condiments, the cold cuts?
SpongeBob	Oh, you want me to try it?
SpongeBob	Uh oh! It looks like were running low on shellac! I'll go get some more.  Boy, those guys can sure terrifying.
SpongeBob	Do I have to call--  Eww.. ectoplasm.
SpongeBob	Order up! Here's your #9 sir!
SpongeBob	Silly Squidward. I'm not going to--
SpongeBob	And you haven't perused my collection of Kenny the Cat periodicals?  Or noticed Kenny on every TV channel known to fishkind?
SpongeBob	Oh, he's on all the new$50 bills.
SpongeBob	Not necessary, Sandy. Like my personal hero, Kenny the Cat, I'm A-ok.
SpongeBob	: Well, you can trust Kenny the-. He's the heroic cat who has been holding his breath for days at a time.
SpongeBob	Uh-huh, yeah.14 hours is cutting it close but I had to work all day.
SpongeBob	Find the goober constellation and the dorsal constellation, then squint your eyes and let the details fall into place.
SpongeBob	But you didn't even get to see my new Kenny the Cat temporary tattoo.
SpongeBob	Kenny, sir, it would mean a lot if you'd sign my official Kenny the Cat spatula.  Thanks, Kenny. You're so real.Oh, you're hungry? What do you say we move this autograph session to the Krusty Krab?  Did you see that?! Kenny just gave me his trademark A-ok handsign! Swoon! Swoon!
SpongeBob	Sorry to bother you, Mr. the Cat, but I thought you'd just like a bite to Whoa!
SpongeBob	I can't believe I fell for such a phony! Oh, well, time to move on. Guess I don't need my Kenny the Cat fan club membership card anymore.Or these Kenny the Cat posters. Oh, Kenny, how could you? :You were my idol!You know, I should really talk about this with someone, or I might get... depressed.
SpongeBob	"You're welcome. I've been holding my breath for more than 20 years, no problem."" ""You can too. Signed, Kenny the Breath-Holding Cat""?"
SpongeBob	Hey, I've got an idea. Most cats hate water, right? Well, you can be the cat that likes water. That way, you're still special.
SpongeBob	Hmm... well, the smoke duct needs sweeping!
SpongeBob	Well, I'm not!
SpongeBob	Oh, wait. What am I worried about? I'm a hard-working, self-motivated sponge.
SpongeBob	Squidward, what are you doing?  Oh, no! Your lack of work is taking on an odor!
SpongeBob	You got it, Squidward!  Anything to keep that Yeti Krab at bay.
SpongeBob	Please don't eat us, Mr. Yeti! We're not lazy!
SpongeBob	Huh? Oh, sorry. Just making all the rivets are securely welded.
SpongeBob	Squidward! You were right! There's no more work to do!  I have done it all!  Which means he is gonna eat us!!
SpongeBob	No, I'm talking about the sound of a hungry customer. He doesn't want to eat us for being lazy, he wants to eat us because he's hungry. Fellas, leave this to me.
SpongeBob	Consider it done!
SpongeBob	What is it?
SpongeBob	Sandy? Hi-yah!
SpongeBob	Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing!
SpongeBob	Go on, go back to where you belong.  Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them. Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind. Remember: there's no place like home!  Sandy, what the heck are you crying about?
SpongeBob	Da-ta-dah.
SpongeBob	Patrick do you hear that?
SpongeBob	Patrick, we can't...that's it! Patrick, your genius is showing!
SpongeBob	You want to come with us to the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	Wait Sandy! You can't! Uhh, we we're gonna...the...the...Krusty Krab...that is not the right direction! Wait, if you don't...if I can't...augh! Sandy! Wait a second! You don't wanna leave without having one last Krabby Patty down at the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	You mean we can't say anything bad about dumb ol' Texas?
SpongeBob	Howdy y'all!
SpongeBob	You'll have to catch us first!  We did it! We got her!
SpongeBob	No! Almost there!
SpongeBob	It's your own little slice of Texas! Check it out Sandy! We got square dancing...  ...giant Barbecues...
SpongeBob	Does that mean you'll stay?
SpongeBob	Ah!  Hmm, something's missing.  Aha! June 15th.  Fine month for pickles.  Order up!  One perfect patty on a pristine plate in a squeaky-clean Krusty Krab. Man, oh, man, do I love my job!  Hey, Mr. Krabs. What's the good word?
SpongeBob	I don't know. Maybe.  Take it.
SpongeBob	Here, I'll get that for you.
SpongeBob	What's that, Gary? You need me? Oh, the unconditional love of a pet.  Oh, I'm sorry. Here I am wallowing in my misery, and it's past your dinnertime.  I used to feed everyone in Bikini Bottom.  Now I just feed you.  Oh, thanks, Gary.
SpongeBob	Patrick, the most horrible thing happened today. I got-- f-f-f-f-f-f-f...
SpongeBob	F-f-f-f...
SpongeBob	Yeah, sure.  Whatever.
SpongeBob	Nope.
SpongeBob	Why? What is it?
SpongeBob	Greetings, purveyor of elongated sausage products! I would love to work at your establishment.
SpongeBob	Your weenies, sir.
SpongeBob	I mean, Mr. Wiener!
SpongeBob	Eh... probably.
SpongeBob	Yeah, of deliciousness!
SpongeBob	How about that?
SpongeBob	Oh, I'll take it, all right. I'll take it to go! Home.
SpongeBob	One homemade can of Snailpo!
SpongeBob	Mr. Weenie?
SpongeBob	Pizza Pete! Yes, please. That wiener has me chained to the grill,  and he really seems to be relishing it.
SpongeBob	Oh, thank you, Seor Taco!  Oh, no! Not you too!
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	Well, if it's okay with you, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Ready for work!  Good morning, Squidward, I...   Not ready for work!
SpongeBob	I guess I was in a panic, I mean I can't believe we're running so late for work, and you, huh, Squidward, can you believe it, are you panicking too? Late for work, late for work, we're running late for work, right?
SpongeBob	Speak English, brainiac!
SpongeBob	There is always a shortcut!
SpongeBob	Oh, tartar sauce! Maybe I should've zagged when I zigged!  First you do a zag, crawl underneath the fence, then you take a little zig, that's how you find a shortcut!  There, that's better.   Now this is what I call a real great shortcut. Now all I have to do is remember my wilderness training so I don't get lost!
SpongeBob	Could you perhaps tell me how to get to the Krusty Krab from here?
SpongeBob	Sandy's wilderness tips are always on the money!  Okay, let's see, I came from...no, I came...  I'M LOST!  Hey, there's one of my landmarks! The broken fire hydrant!  Hello, hydrant! I'm going to call you Heidi. Heidi the Hydrant!  So many broken fire hydrants. What do I do now, Heidi? If only I could telephone Squidward. He'd help me out. Hey, that thing looks kind of like a phone.  Wow, this is weird. It's like a phone, but you put money in it. My last dime.  I hope this works.
SpongeBob	I don't have a dime! Operator, please, please, can you tell me where I am?
SpongeBob	What ya doing there, drinking soda?
SpongeBob	Yes! To the Krusty Krab, and step on it!
SpongeBob	Squidward! Squidward, can you believe I made it?!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.  Oh, I can't even cry right!
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	It is?
SpongeBob	I do?
SpongeBob	Inch, inch. Inch, inch, inch. Inch, inch.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, let's just leave the boat here and walk.
SpongeBob	Well, at least I didn't hit the Krusty Krab that time.
SpongeBob	You never!
SpongeBob	Man, I don't think I'm ready for this, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	My turn? Gee, Mr. Krabs, you must really believe in me.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Mr. K. I'll show you the ropes.
SpongeBob	How busy would you say you are on a scale of eight to nine?
SpongeBob	I found a jump rope!
SpongeBob	I like openings.
SpongeBob	Oh, he said he had a package for the Widow Duncan. I think he went...
SpongeBob	Yes? I'm still here.
SpongeBob	Okey-doke.
SpongeBob	Will do.
SpongeBob	: Hello, Patrick.
SpongeBob	:  An executive!
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm playing picnic with my wonderful little food friends Herb and Loretta! These are their kids Timmy and Sally.
SpongeBob	Well, I could try.  Here's a little worker. We'll call him Pete.
SpongeBob	Hey, maybe if Pete can go on a picnic like the Patty family, he might be rested and happy and more productive than ever!
SpongeBob	Definitely!
SpongeBob	Going long!
SpongeBob	Hi, I'm Barnacle Boy.
SpongeBob	Aww!
SpongeBob	Aw, no thanks, Plankton. We're having a great time at our own company picnic.
SpongeBob	Yum.
SpongeBob	You want me to paint your face?
SpongeBob	No. Course not.
SpongeBob	Whoo!  Having lots of fun over here. I've got a plate! It's made of paper!
SpongeBob	Ahem! Hello, Plankton!
SpongeBob	No!!!
SpongeBob	The greatest company picnic ever!
SpongeBob	Who he?
SpongeBob	Gee, Mr. Krabs. That second guard sounds like a real goofball.
SpongeBob	What's the matter, pal? Walking too fast for ya?
SpongeBob	Aww. I'm gonna called you, Seor Poopus. Good job, Gary. Let's get him home so he can eat. He's almost all shell.
SpongeBob	Oh, Gary found this stray snail and I'm nursing him back to health.
SpongeBob	Uh, good suggestion, Patrick. But I got this.
SpongeBob	Eat up, you little cuties.
SpongeBob	Oh! You must be the snail mom.
SpongeBob	Oh. Uh, excuse me. Pardon me. Uh, just a minute!
SpongeBob	Ok, would you guys just relax? You're all gonna get fed. Dani, keep out of Walter's dish. Obulax, what are you doing? Cheryl, Henry, no fighting.
SpongeBob	Oh, hey, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Even Gary?
SpongeBob	Oh, another little stray friend. What is your name little fellow?
SpongeBob	Uh, hello, police.
SpongeBob	Sanctuary! Sanctuary! Everybody in! Everybody in!
SpongeBob	Esmerelda?
SpongeBob	Thanks, Bob. We will. But I'm going back to being a one snail guy. That's the way I like it.
SpongeBob	Founders Day is here today, Squidward is this even?
SpongeBob	Well it's not just that, Mr. Krabs has a lot of love in his heart for this town.
SpongeBob	His taxes?
SpongeBob	Who's ready!
SpongeBob	"I don't know. Let me check the rules.  Playing ""Certified Public Accountant"" isn't as much fun as I thought.  Maybe it'll be funner if we play louder!"
SpongeBob	"Hey, Squidward. Wanna play ""Certified Public Accountant"" with us?"
SpongeBob	Go get'em, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Yeah, Patrick. What's it called?
SpongeBob	Oh, what should I do? What should I do? What should I do?
SpongeBob	Sounds like someone's mad because he hasn't moved.
SpongeBob	Squidward made us say his name.
SpongeBob	I'll...
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward, you finally understand the rules!
SpongeBob	I'll have one...
SpongeBob	Aww, barnacles.  Plankton, what are you doing here? And why are you crying?
SpongeBob	Yeah?
SpongeBob	Anything I want.  Sounds great!
SpongeBob	But I'm a spo...
SpongeBob	You can have it.
SpongeBob	Uhh, I thought it was called assertive.
SpongeBob	Do you want to take a hike with me?
SpongeBob	Hey! I'm gonna tie your shoe if you don't give that back!
SpongeBob	But what about airline food?
SpongeBob	Just watch me!  Man, this thing is sandy!
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Mega Bucket?! You used me... for land development!  That wasn't nice!
SpongeBob	No problem!
SpongeBob	"""The Krusty Krab Stadium."" Wow!"
SpongeBob	Psst. Hey, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Done! More please!
SpongeBob	Done! Even the theoretical particles are clean. Theoretically.
SpongeBob	How am I doing boss?
SpongeBob	What's really funny is that it was Mr. Krabs' safe. The one with the...
SpongeBob	One second.  Employees must wash hands before leaving.
SpongeBob	That way.
SpongeBob	I hope we don't run into anything like that down here.
SpongeBob	Sewer, sewer! Cha-cha-cha!
SpongeBob	There it is!
SpongeBob	Ooh! Look! You are here!
SpongeBob	Squidward, the safe! Squidward! Safe!
SpongeBob	Who's hungry?
SpongeBob	Longpants?  Well, I don't think I'm ready for looong pants.
SpongeBob	He called me a man! And my knees are a perfect 72 degrees!
SpongeBob	Squidward, how much is the senior discount?
SpongeBob	Okay!  How is that patty treating you sir?
SpongeBob	As much as I hate to admit it, I've outgrown the Krusty Krab. Time for me to move on!
SpongeBob	Has it all ready been one hour? One more time!  Huh?
SpongeBob	I finally got my drivers license!
SpongeBob	SpongeBob!
SpongeBob	I'm looking for the party!
SpongeBob	I don't get it. We have been staring at this table for three hours. That table could use a cleaning.
SpongeBob	Are you remembering to flip the patties clockwise, it's very important because..
SpongeBob	Not only am I one of those nitwits, I actually work there!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, why aren't you watching the movie?
SpongeBob	Sounds great! And I'll be driving to work.
SpongeBob	Excuse me, Larry. I was just working out and I was wondering. Is this normal?
SpongeBob	Hooray!
SpongeBob	Ok, I will!
SpongeBob	How am I doing?
SpongeBob	Oh, I can do that. That's what I do when I laugh.  Only now, I'll do it on my back.
SpongeBob	Aw! That's gonna come out of my paycheck!
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm late for the gym! Can you cover for me in the kitchen, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Yeah, Larry! Sure you will!
SpongeBob	I taught me just do stuff you'll always do, but do it on your back. Laugh on your back.
SpongeBob	I hope Larry's ok. But while we're waiting, I guess we could ride bicycles on our backs.
SpongeBob	This sounds great.
SpongeBob	Here's to our new lives! Our terrible, terrible new lives!
SpongeBob	Brug.
SpongeBob	Act normal?
SpongeBob	Naturally.
SpongeBob	Pretty please with sugar on top?
SpongeBob	Oh boy! Am I ever! Can you hook us up to electrodes? Or. Or expose us to gamma rays?
SpongeBob	We're back!
SpongeBob	Well, let's get counting. Should we both count white sand and move onto the black sand or do you want to have your own bucket?
SpongeBob	One.
SpongeBob	Forty-seven. Forty-seven?
SpongeBob	How about you count the white and I count the black sand.
SpongeBob	Do you wanna trade?
SpongeBob	Patrick, you call that fair?
SpongeBob	Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now?
SpongeBob	Hey! My ice cream is melted all over your hand!
SpongeBob	One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and one, One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and two, One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and three.
SpongeBob	Would you like sprinkles on it?
SpongeBob	But we didn't even finish counting the sand!
SpongeBob	Oh yeah!
SpongeBob	Come and get it!
SpongeBob	Would you like our house red or or house yellow?
SpongeBob	You dropped this.
SpongeBob	Great job, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Flipping.
SpongeBob	Yes, sir!
SpongeBob	I've got two thumbs-up!
SpongeBob	Well, girl, you really make it work.
SpongeBob	Are you kidding?
SpongeBob	Oh, Sandy, don't be such a worry whale.
SpongeBob	Hey, guy. Way to wait.
SpongeBob	Way to flick that eye booger--
SpongeBob	An action like a thumbs-up?
SpongeBob	No! I can do it.
SpongeBob	With a little practice, you could do anything.   Oh...
SpongeBob	Leave me Sandra, forget you ever knew me! Erase from your memory the face of this useless sponge! With these......mutilated thumbs!
SpongeBob	My thumbs are better and I am ready to work!
SpongeBob	Never!
SpongeBob	Yes Patrick?
SpongeBob	Wah! Ah ha! There you are
SpongeBob	Hello Sharkface, my name is SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob	Ooh, fancy stitching.
SpongeBob	Are they okay?
SpongeBob	That guy seemed really scared of us.
SpongeBob	The whats?
SpongeBob	Oh uh, didn't you hear, the nice officers said there won't be a showdown.
SpongeBob	Um,  oh okay see you guys there. Bye.
SpongeBob	I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Back up Pods, don't make me hurt you!
SpongeBob	But what about those girls that screamed and fainted?
SpongeBob	But, you Sharks kidnapped Gary!
SpongeBob	Oh no! It's the coppers!
SpongeBob	Now everybody's a winner.
SpongeBob	How's this? Like this? What about this? Is this good?
SpongeBob	Nah! I feel fine!
SpongeBob	Oh, Plankton. Yellow is my natural color. []
SpongeBob	Wow! We look alike and have the same name! That's two things we have in common! [] I always wanted a twin brother!  How do you feel about bubbles?
SpongeBob	I think I'll nickname you... Me two!
SpongeBob	Sure.
SpongeBob	The Chum Bucket?
SpongeBob	Me Two! Me Two! Oh! What happened to him?!
SpongeBob	I can believe it.
SpongeBob	Yeah, thanks, Plankton. Things did get a bit out of hand with all those me's around.
SpongeBob	A forever hike?
SpongeBob	Well, we might as well spend the night here. It's not so bad. We could make a home out of all this trash!
SpongeBob	So now we live here.
SpongeBob	A pile-of-trash house! Patrick and I built one out back with all your garbage!
SpongeBob	I miss the old neighborhood! I think I'm gonna visit my old house tonight!
SpongeBob	But if I just ask politely to visit do you think they--
SpongeBob	Guten morgan! My name is SpongeBob! I came here to visit my old home. (Guten morgen! Mein Name ist SpongeBob! Ich bin gekommen um mein altes Heimat zu besuchen.)
SpongeBob	Wife? Where is she?
SpongeBob	Oh, Gerhard! Are you coming back?
SpongeBob	Well aren't your twelve little German children gonna sing for me while I eat?
SpongeBob	I think the littlest kiddywink is off-key.
SpongeBob	Well if he doesn't live in them, what does he do with them?
SpongeBob	Sure is!
SpongeBob	We're moving today!
SpongeBob	Whew, I'm thirsty!   This is an extreme thirst!
SpongeBob	He told me to tell you... April Fools.
SpongeBob	Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Hey, what's that?
SpongeBob	April Fools!
SpongeBob	Hey, your shoes untied.  April Fools! You're not wearing shoes!  April Fools!
SpongeBob	Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Squidward! Is all that true?
SpongeBob	What would we do without Squidward?
SpongeBob	Gary, that was a pretty heavy cloud.
SpongeBob	Whoo, fortune cookies! Vague prophecies baked into delicious bite sized snacks. These cookies can see the future, Gary, which means they knew we were hungry, even before we did. Let's eat!
SpongeBob	Aw, why not, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	All right!
SpongeBob	Fortunes flying in, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Here Plankton, Mr. Krabs wants you to have this.
SpongeBob	Ahh, the perfect end to a perfect day: buying ourselves the perfect ice cream.
SpongeBob	Can you imagine if they had frozen Krabby Patties at the supermarket? Oh, that would be so convenient, everyone in the world could enjoy them.
SpongeBob	"Oh, uh, ""Krabby Patties: Taste so nice that they... taste nice."""
SpongeBob	Hey, that was my slogan.
SpongeBob	"But what is ""filler""?"
SpongeBob	Great, can we go back to the Krusty Krab now?
SpongeBob	You mean my last one for the morning rush?
SpongeBob	Oh, please, re-hire me Mr. Krabs. I'll do anything.
SpongeBob	"Ahem,  ""hello, and welcome to the Krusty Krab Museum, the original home of the Krabby Patty, now available in the frozen food section of your local supermarket."""
SpongeBob	I brought ice cream. Me and my best friend are gonna share the ice cream. Who knows? Maybe we'll even get a chance to share pants.  Again.
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah, I guess I should get this in a freezer. Patrick, where's the kitchen?
SpongeBob	Whoa, oof!
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, rehearsing your big 400th commercial, huh?
SpongeBob	Oh, nothing's been the same since those frozen patties came out.  I miss the old Krusty Krab. I miss Patrickoof!
SpongeBob	That'll be $1.99, please.
SpongeBob	Oh, what's the point? These Frozen Krabby Patties have ruined my life, Squidward. And it was all my idea. Who am I to fight the future?
SpongeBob	Mm! I am going to show the world what a fresh,  not frozen Krabby Patty tastes like, and the first one is for my best friend, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Patrick, the frozen patties are made with sand!
SpongeBob	I got something for you, from one friend to another.
SpongeBob	Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
SpongeBob	Go on, have a bite.
SpongeBob	Yeah! The Krusty Krab is back in business!
SpongeBob	Hey!
SpongeBob	Yes, ma'am!
SpongeBob	Oh, they're not mine. They're my friend, Sandy's.
SpongeBob	Even better!
SpongeBob	Sandy, according to the Shalmon's book, we shouldn't try to force nature to give us more than she's able.
SpongeBob	Oh no! Patrick, we have to do something! Sandy'll never forgive us if we ruined her tree!
SpongeBob	Shalmon?
SpongeBob	Community!
SpongeBob	Nothing! I just love to shriek!
SpongeBob	"Huh? ""Crisis averted? More like crisis dumb-blurted."" Signed, Guybesideu3?"
SpongeBob	Well, I'll just have to make my Krabby Patties better so P-Star7 will like 'em.
SpongeBob	Now it's smaller than that one!
SpongeBob	Well, why didn't you tell me?
SpongeBob	You may be handsome, HandsomeLad42, but you're very mean!
SpongeBob	No. A master of acid-wit like P-Star7 would never express himself so clumsily. He called me Cry-Baby139.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, the grill's gone cold.
SpongeBob	Oh, P-Star7 is bringing out the worst in everybody. I'd like to send him a message.
SpongeBob	Pineapple1 to Maddaddy. Come in, Maddaddy.
SpongeBob	Surprise, P-Star7!
SpongeBob	You hear that, boardy? It wasn't you. It was never you. We were the monsters all along.
SpongeBob	Oh boy! The Krabby Patty is a sure bet to win the Golden Cornucopia!
SpongeBob	I spy with my little eye...
SpongeBob	I spy with my little eye...
SpongeBob	Hey!
SpongeBob	Peep!
SpongeBob	Whew! Thank Neptune, we're ok!
SpongeBob	We must guard this last patty with our very lives! It's the only way to win Food Con! And who knows what scary, hungry things are out there in the woods waiting to gobble it up!
SpongeBob	Oh, what are we gonna do?!
SpongeBob	Thanks, Patrick. That'll be great.
SpongeBob	Hey!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	Out here, we call them forest tomatoes.
SpongeBob	Yeow!!
SpongeBob	Maybe you're right.
SpongeBob	What?  Food Con!
SpongeBob	Please! Try a delicious Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob	Ohh!
SpongeBob	"Hmm... ""Dear Pen Pal, my name is SpongeBob SquarePants..."" Oh, that's great! ""I work at a restaurant. I love frying and I'm very good at it. Sincerely, your new best friend!"" Behold, the perfect letter! Now for the envelope."
SpongeBob	Ah, perfect!
SpongeBob	"Ha! What a silly misunderstanding. ""I can't believe I know a real life pilot! I wish I could watch you fly, because I am dying!""  Dying?! Not Pen Pal!"
SpongeBob	"""Dearest Pen Pal, yes, I can fly! Boy, do I love flying! Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly!"""
SpongeBob	I did a bad thing, Sandy! I did a very bad thing!
SpongeBob	Uh, what on a which?
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Oh, there's my house!
SpongeBob	I'm doing it! I'm actually doing it! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob	What an honor it is to finally meet you! Oh, you pretty, pretty pen pal you.
SpongeBob	Take off. Don't die. Fly a few seconds lower to the ground. Don't die. Slam. Don't die. So simple.
SpongeBob	Just fine.
SpongeBob	Patrick? You're Pen Pal?
SpongeBob	It all makes sense now!  Oh, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick. Who's flying the plane?!
SpongeBob	Patrick, it was my pleasure.
SpongeBob	Not the patties! I'll save you!
SpongeBob	Yes, sir. I see the problem.
SpongeBob	Uh, yeah. One could say that I guess. Uh, anyway. I gotta go wash my formula.  Hair! Hair! I gotta go wash my hair! Uh, good night, Plankton.
SpongeBob	Stay sharp, Gary. Don't let anyone inside.
SpongeBob	What happened here?  My first Krabby Patty! I had it bronzed! Oh, and I was gonna give that to my grandchildren!  My Mermaid Man collectible underpants! Oh, I could've worn them a thousand more times!  My glass of water!  I was gonna drink that! Oh, the Krabby Patty formula!
SpongeBob	What's the matter, Gary? Something wrong with your shell?
SpongeBob	Hey, it's Plankton.
SpongeBob	Um, Plankton, can I come out now?
SpongeBob	Hurry up, Mr. Krabs. They're handing out the diplomas.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, your diploma!
SpongeBob	Squidward, while I steer you tell everyone we're safe.
SpongeBob	Hey, everybody, can we take a time out? This is Mr. Krabs we're talking about. The worst tyrant in the seven seas.
SpongeBob	He also created the Chatty Patty for teens. And who can forget the Hatty Patty. The patty you wear as a hat.
SpongeBob	Until then,  I'll leave a dollar in the window for ya.
SpongeBob	Yes, I'd like to place an order.
SpongeBob	Uh, Captain, sorry to interrupt, but the crew needs you to protect them.
SpongeBob	Oh, what was I doing now?
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, this job calls for a dictator like you!
SpongeBob	Got it!  Do you know what this is, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Well then, I'm gonna do the worst thing I can do to your old dime!
SpongeBob	Here you go, Mr. Krabs. You earned it.
SpongeBob	Maybe you should do something about that.
SpongeBob	Oh, don't worry, Patrick. Dentists are our friends.  Huh? Patrick? Patrick?
SpongeBob	Oh boy! Aren't dentist offices fun?  Oh, they've got colorful wooden beads on wires!  Whoa, look at it go!
SpongeBob	Good boy. Ow!
SpongeBob	Patrick, come back!
SpongeBob	Tooth Island is a wonderful place where teeth can bee free! They can soak in the calcium pools all day or sleep in the comfort of the pink gum trees. They get to swing on floss vines and never ever have to worry about cavities.
SpongeBob	What's the matter, pal?
SpongeBob	It is not baloney!
SpongeBob	You see, Patrick? We have got to get that tooth out.
SpongeBob	Patrick, can I show you something?
SpongeBob	Patrick, you don't understand! I'm just helping to get your tooth to the Tooth Fairy!
SpongeBob	Behold, the Tooth Ferry!
SpongeBob	Oh, here. This is yours.
SpongeBob	Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula!
SpongeBob	Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way.  Uh-oh.
SpongeBob	But, but...
SpongeBob	Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!
SpongeBob	I'm ready.
SpongeBob	Once upon a time...
SpongeBob	What's so funny?
SpongeBob	I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you too.
SpongeBob	Hi, Patrick. What'll you have?  Can you excuse me?
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Free my mind! Free my mind! Free my mind!
SpongeBob	No, it's mine!
SpongeBob	Step one...  Oh, I see what to do.
SpongeBob	It's time to free our minds!
SpongeBob	Patrick, no more eye bumps. Okay?
SpongeBob	Found him!
SpongeBob	Hey, what's going on? Everything went dark! Uh, Patrick, can you see anything?
SpongeBob	Our brains are probably right around here somewhere. Uh, here brains! Brains! Here, boy!
SpongeBob	Oh, darn it. I still can't see.
SpongeBob	Patrick, we need help. Let's call Sandy.
SpongeBob	Oh, I love it when Sandy gets aggressive. Let's give her some room.
SpongeBob	Patrick?
SpongeBob	To the Invisible Boatmobile!
SpongeBob	And littering is a crime.
SpongeBob	Yes, my young pink ward. It's none other than...
SpongeBob	He's obviously raising an army of mutant vegetables. And that song he's singing will...
SpongeBob	Mermaid Man, crime-fighter! Barnacle Boy, makes new!
SpongeBob	Of the first variety.
SpongeBob	Alright, Doctor Negative. We'll play along and take it out. Hiya!
SpongeBob	Why are we fighting Captain Tightwad? He didn't even commit a crime.
SpongeBob	Well, yes Mr. Krabs. But you're not really robbing a bank, you're just pretending to.
SpongeBob	Boink!
SpongeBob	Hey, wha... what are you doing?
SpongeBob	Swing, Boy Yonder! Swing the basket!
SpongeBob	Yes, it was a very close one, Squidward. Close and warm.  Mr. Krabs was really flattered by your imitation.
SpongeBob	No problem, Squidward, I'll get you those orders as soon as possible.
SpongeBob	Hey, there, Patrick old buddy.
SpongeBob	Wait, what?
SpongeBob	I like to use science for good.
SpongeBob	80,000 impressions later...
SpongeBob	Are we having fun yet, Squidward Tentacles?
SpongeBob	Oh, boy, someone's at the door! I can't wait to imitate 'em!  Oh, hello, Patrick! And Sandy? And Squidward? And Mr. Krabs? Plankton too? Five at once, huh? Okay, here goes nothing.
SpongeBob	I'm-a trying, Sandy, I'm-a trying!
SpongeBob	I... don't... kno-o-ow!
SpongeBob	I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!! I remember! I know who I am! I am SpongeBob SquarePants, and yes, I do like cooking with lard!
SpongeBob	Hi.  Gary, I feel funny inside.
SpongeBob	Gary, there's something inside of me.
SpongeBob	Oh, hello.
SpongeBob	Okay, okay. Enough's enough. It's time for you to go, little guy. I already have a petGary. I'm afraid I just don't need another one.
SpongeBob	Okay, little buddy, but just for one night.
SpongeBob	Wow, a house party going on inside of me! Hey, why wasn't I invited?  I guess I was since I am the house! Look, Gary, now we have tons of prickly new friends!
SpongeBob	Oh, my gosh! I completely lost all track of time! Hey, uh, sorry to be a party pooper, guys, but I've gotta take a shower and get ready for work.
SpongeBob	Ow!  Open up, Gary! I'm still in my underwear!
SpongeBob	II dddon't know what you mean, sir.
SpongeBob	It's okay, Mr. Krabs, they're not hurting me.
SpongeBob	Anything, Plankton! Anything!
SpongeBob	Aw! Hmm?
SpongeBob	Well, this is my life from now on, huh?  Just call me SpongeBob WormPants, cause that's all I am, just an apartment for worms.
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah! Fizz Bomb Cola!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, no!
SpongeBob	Hit the dirt!
SpongeBob	Aww.
SpongeBob	Squidward, time to wake up. Wake up, little Squidward.  Patrick, Squidward won't wake up.
SpongeBob	Patrick, you are a genius!
SpongeBob	Yours.
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, I'm gonna see if I can make Squidward talk.
SpongeBob	Whoa, whoops. Watch out. Take it easy.
SpongeBob	Pardon me.
SpongeBob	Excuse me, ma'am. I'm looking for the concert hall.
SpongeBob	Patrick, do you have any change?
SpongeBob	Ew, why'd you put it there?
SpongeBob	Patrick, I don't think I can command his brain much longer!
SpongeBob	Ow!
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	Fancy. Got it, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I was just doing what you told me.
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	Come on, guys! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob	What do we do now, Gary? We read every book and played every game! Hey, I know! How about another makeover?
SpongeBob	Okay, everybody, order up!  Guess I'm used to making Krabby Patties in mass quantities.
SpongeBob	Here, try one.
SpongeBob	I could use a boss. Someone to take all the credit and all the money.
SpongeBob	Well, it was  while it lasted!
SpongeBob	I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. It looks the same.
SpongeBob	Plankton, I know where this is going. I'd love it if you'd stay with me!
SpongeBob	Oh, boy! Does this mean you're gonna stay with me?
SpongeBob	Hey, this is your safe place. It's okay to talk about your feelings.  Oh, somebody's tense!
SpongeBob	Well, sometimes you can get a little...aggressive.
SpongeBob	All right, Plankton. Now you try!
SpongeBob	Okay, Plankton, since you don't seem to be able to do something nice, in this lesson you're going to learn to  something nice.
SpongeBob	Plankton, Patrick was complimenting you.
SpongeBob	Oh, yes, she is. You just need to do something big. Be vulnerable, be sweet. Show Karen your heart.
SpongeBob	Plankton, are you sure about this?
SpongeBob	Thank you!  Ow!  I mean, thank you. Whoa! Beep boop beep bo boop!
SpongeBob	Oh! You have made me the happiest girl robot in the world!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Plankton. You just said nice things to me.
SpongeBob	Yeah, I am ripped.
SpongeBob	I... Umm...
SpongeBob	Ooh!
SpongeBob	Well, let's try to get hurt and we'll see.
SpongeBob	Uh-huh, we're trying.
SpongeBob	What? I can't hear you!
SpongeBob	Blast me with your venom!
SpongeBob	"We call it, ""The Sushi Maker.""  Squidward, I think you need this more than I. I would like to present you with my life insurance policy."
SpongeBob	Whoo!
SpongeBob	What you gonna do, Squidward?
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Well, let's see.  No name here.
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward, guess what I learned today. Apparently, a life insurance policy doesn't protect a person from injury. Heh, how about that?
SpongeBob	I'm trying!
SpongeBob	So, uh, how'd I do?
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, you want to hang out?
SpongeBob	All right, all right.
SpongeBob	Gary!
SpongeBob	You should've been there, Gary! Oh, it was like a dream come true!
SpongeBob	Well, I suppose I could tap into my rainy day reserves.
SpongeBob	I'm on it, Larry!
SpongeBob	You must be here for the bubble lessons. Don't worry, Mrs. P.  You'll be learning from a master.
SpongeBob	Nice start.
SpongeBob	Nice and easy. Doing great.
SpongeBob	Ah!
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. Even though it was bubbles that caused all these problems, it was also bubbles that solved 'em. That's kind of a wash, I guess. Get it? Wash? Soap? Bubbles?
SpongeBob	Oh, sure thing, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Uh huh!
SpongeBob	Sure thing, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Okay, Patrick, it's all in the technique!  First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, Don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then...
SpongeBob	We're not just blowing bubbles. We're making bubble art! Watch carefully.  First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Theeeen pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, Don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then...
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward, remember the technique.
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table nine.
SpongeBob	What could be worse than that?
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Doesn't look like any carnival I ever...  Excuse me.  Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr. Krabs said they were really dangerous.
SpongeBob	Patrick, don't!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.
SpongeBob	Ready?
SpongeBob	I...I...I...
SpongeBob	I'm ready!  I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, ready, ready. I'm ready.
SpongeBob	You don't have any fingers, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs that I wouldn't go near another...  ...hook!  Oh no! Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar. A deceiver. I'll never fall for your tricks again. Never!  Is this seat taken?  Whew. Glad I got that out of my system.  I'm...hooked! And that means...  Help! I'm hooked! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!
SpongeBob	Umm...no.  I mean yes, yes, you told me not to go near them.
SpongeBob	Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls.  Doh, ok. I'm taking em off. I'm taking 'em off.  There.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, did you see that? Plankton is retiring.
SpongeBob	"""Welcome to Dullsville, a charmingly boring..."""
SpongeBob	Uh, please don't shake me, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Hello? Krusty Krab, make I take your order? No, Mr. Krabs is unable to come to the phone right now. He's trapped under a dust cloud brawl. Yeah, he'll have to call you back.  Gee, I hope our robot look-alikes are okay. Bless their heart-like pneumatic pumps.
SpongeBob	I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	37 patties? How am I gonna flip 37 patties?  Huh, has my spatula always had three heads?
SpongeBob	Dance! Come on, dance! I'm trying, Mr. Krabs!  I'm trying!  Come on, you, work!
SpongeBob	Hey, what's this?  Whoa! My spatula is magic!
SpongeBob	There is no problem I cannot solve, for I am SpongeBob, Emperor of the Sea!  Hey, get outta here, you pesky jellyfish!
SpongeBob	I can fix this!
SpongeBob	Oh, I just made it worse! Patrick, I've ruined everything.
SpongeBob	My spatula! Then what's this?
SpongeBob	Sorry! Pardon me! It's stuck!
SpongeBob	Thanks for bailing me out, Neptune. If there's any way I can ever help you, just let me know.
SpongeBob	Awww. I worked forever on those life-sized Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
SpongeBob	Humph. Maybe the Conch Signal doesn't work anymore.
SpongeBob	Oh, that was me. I blew the Conch Signal, sir.
SpongeBob	Yes, sir.
SpongeBob	But...
SpongeBob	Hey, can I drive?
SpongeBob	You're under arrest, Atomic Flounder.
SpongeBob	Okay.
SpongeBob	Aw, that's the 15th time I've looked.  But I can't let my heroes down.
SpongeBob	You don't understand! You're my most favorite super villain. Can I get your autograph?
SpongeBob	Are you OK, Gary.
SpongeBob	Twelve bubbles blowing!
SpongeBob	Well, leaving a hose running can waste  thousands of gallons of water per month.
SpongeBob	Gary!  Uh, uh, I was just looking for the sports channel, Gary.  Come in!
SpongeBob	Do you know how lucky you are to have a friend like me?
SpongeBob	Patrick, please, shoe-tying requires peace and quiet. Okay, where was I?
SpongeBob	Okay, no more fooling around.  I've got it!
SpongeBob	Oh, no! I can't let Patrick see I still haven't tied my shoes.
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward, I've got an idea! How about you come get it?
SpongeBob	Okay, Squidward.  Just slowly move your leg. Walk over there... with the...  Dah!
SpongeBob	Hold it... Doy!  Let me just...  Doy!
SpongeBob	I... I... I... I... I... I...
SpongeBob	So you'll show me how?
SpongeBob	Could any of you show me how to tie my laces?  Could you, you, you, you, or you show me how to tie a knot?  Could you show me how to tie a simple knot?  Could you show me how to tie my shoes?  Could you show me how to tie my shoes?
SpongeBob	Yes, please, Mr. Flying Dutchman, sir.
SpongeBob	Ooh...
SpongeBob	I'm not in the mood, Gary.
SpongeBob	WHERE IS ALL THIS LITTER COMING FROM?!
SpongeBob	It's beautiful!
SpongeBob	Good one Squidward!
SpongeBob	Krabby Patty!  Yummy!
SpongeBob	Deliciousness!
SpongeBob	Goo, Goo! Ga, Ga!
SpongeBob	Feeling shabby? Get a Krabby Patty!  No, too poetic...  Order up!  Perfect!  La, la la la la... Oh! It magically knows all my friends! What's Sandy doing on here?
SpongeBob	Mmm... Ahh!   Whoops!    Oh Squidward, ever the artisque.
SpongeBob	But in the end, we decided to just give it all away.
SpongeBob	What's wrong, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Ahh! Really?
SpongeBob	But wait, if I'm running the register and the grill, what are you gonna do?
SpongeBob	I can't believe this is really happening.  Today, I start living!
SpongeBob	May I help you, sir?
SpongeBob	I'm sure you are.  How's that?
SpongeBob	Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands?
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward.  Are you finished with those errands yet?
SpongeBob	Squidward?! You can't eat all those patties in one time!
SpongeBob	Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before.
SpongeBob	Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!
SpongeBob	Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward.  We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess.
SpongeBob	We'll see about that!
SpongeBob	Yes!
SpongeBob	It was me, Mr. Krabs! Please don't tear me into a thousand little pieces and mesh me back together and tear me to pieces again!
SpongeBob	Ah, pie fried on the grill. Just as nature intended.
SpongeBob	Wow, it's Sunday, Gary! Guess what's for breakfast?
SpongeBob	Wow! A parade! Hi, parade!  Hi tuba player, hi drummer, hi guy with the cymbals, hi trumpeter, hi tambourine girl, hi timbale man, hi didgeridoo player,  hi triangle player, hi guy with the kettle drum, hi pianist, hi guy with the flute. And heeelllooo, Dolly!
SpongeBob	Patrick, everyone is running away from me. Watch.  Hi, building!  I just don't get it.
SpongeBob	Hi.
SpongeBob	Go. Run away like all the others. No one would want a friend as ugly as I am.
SpongeBob	I can't.
SpongeBob	Square?
SpongeBob	I'm ugly and I'm proud.
SpongeBob	I don't know. How about a movie?  Pardon me. Ugly Sponge coming through.
SpongeBob	Hello.
SpongeBob	Oh, wait, Patrick! I just remembered.  I've got some of my peanut-onion sundae we can share!
SpongeBob	Just remember what we talked about. There's power in pride.
SpongeBob	Patrick!  You're not ugly. Your breath stinks. Really bad.
SpongeBob	What else?
SpongeBob	Oh, guess what, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward, are we there yet?
SpongeBob	But are we there-
SpongeBob	I don't think that's a good idea.
SpongeBob	Hi.
SpongeBob	Right!
SpongeBob	What's in the box?
SpongeBob	Okay, Squidward.  Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever!
SpongeBob	Me? Really?
SpongeBob	The King Krab?
SpongeBob	Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl.
SpongeBob	But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato.
SpongeBob	Uh... right on.
SpongeBob	Thanks, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob	That's not what I said, sir.
SpongeBob	Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-
SpongeBob	Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing.  Pearl I need to have a word with you!
SpongeBob	Pearl, you're fired.
SpongeBob	She's off to bigger and better things.
SpongeBob	Come on, Squidward! Since you already got a surfboard and shorts!
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward! Wanna go surfing?  Hmmm. I guess surfing isn't his thing.
SpongeBob	This is awesome!
SpongeBob	Go long. Gotcha.
SpongeBob	Hi, Squidward, why is everyone so honking mad?
SpongeBob	Hey, nice rhythms, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Too little? Yeah, little bit drafty, too.
SpongeBob	Well, Patrick, I'm glad you asked that question.  I would give free Krabby Patties, to the whoole darn town.
SpongeBob	And that's what I would do. What would you do, Patrick?
SpongeBob	That's great, Patrick. What's it for?
SpongeBob	Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?
SpongeBob	Aww, Patrick, don't cry.[Patrick starts sobbing loudly going away from the awards]
SpongeBob	Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.
SpongeBob	Smaller.
SpongeBob	And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?
SpongeBob	No, you have to take the tray to the customer.
SpongeBob	Let's try something different.
SpongeBob	It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out?
SpongeBob	Kitchen!
SpongeBob	Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do.  Exactly as I do.  Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob	Wow. It's amazing how a simple change of clothes can make a guy look...just...like...me.
SpongeBob	Forget my hat.
SpongeBob	Why are you doing that?
SpongeBob	At least I'm safe inside my mind.
SpongeBob	We'll see about that!
SpongeBob	Not much fun being me, now, huh Patrick?
SpongeBob	Another trophy?
SpongeBob	The Story of  King Neptune.  When King Neptune was a little Neptune, his mother sent him adrift in a river. As he floated along, a giant meteor fell on Earth. An alien appeared, and inflicted the baby with Super Neptune Fluid.  By the time he was in school, he had already begun excibiting signs of super-duperness. As an adult, he would fly through the sea, helping people, and getting snails off of sea-trees.
SpongeBob	Jellyfishing Safety Tips. Rule number one: never to feed the jellyfish while jellyfishing.
SpongeBob	Oh, hello. Welcome to the Bikini Bottom Jellyfish Trauma Center. Let's go inside.  Ow!
SpongeBob	Ow, that pickle's Plankton. What happened to you?
SpongeBob	Patrick, what are you doing here?
SpongeBob	Eh, no.  Too far.  Oops! Wrong way!
SpongeBob	Hey everybody! It's time to dance!
SpongeBob	Patrick, are you okay?
SpongeBob	Is runaway on that list?
SpongeBob	Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me.  Another note.
SpongeBob	"Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy!  Nah...  Rock Buddy! Nope...  Sink Buddy! ""[Sink Buddy drips a little water]"" Almost...  I've got it!  Bubble Buddy!  This...is...great!  I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs.  Don't be shy, come on!"
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm not hungry.
SpongeBob	Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you.  Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just take one of everything.
SpongeBob	Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws.  Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch.
SpongeBob	Here we are buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here.
SpongeBob	My friend's in there.
SpongeBob	Hey Bubble Buddy, you're finished!
SpongeBob	Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable.
SpongeBob	No! I won't let you!  Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha! Never!  Never...
SpongeBob	Noo...
SpongeBob	The question still persists, why do they call me GumShoe?  Well maybe this is why! But where did it come from?  More importantly, can I exercise the five second rule? Hmmm, why not?  What now?
SpongeBob	Patrick, this looks like a job for SpongeLock Holmes and Dr. Patson.
SpongeBob	I can't wait to see the ancient rains, I even brought an umbrella.
SpongeBob	Oh, I'd say up is...  Oh, that way.
SpongeBob	Oooh, purty.
SpongeBob	Ooh! Really, really, mesmerizing.
SpongeBob	Oh, please forgive me robots, I didn't mean to ruin your ruins.
SpongeBob	Not a penny, there just doing what they were made to do.
SpongeBob	Sure.  How's that?
SpongeBob	Cut! That was great Patrick, but can you give me more feeling?
SpongeBob	Cut! Once more with feeling!
SpongeBob	Cut! Take five.
SpongeBob	Me! My name is SpongeBob!
SpongeBob	Wa...wa...wait!
SpongeBob	Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift.  Ta-dah.
SpongeBob	Is this any better, Squidward? I made this one with my tears.
SpongeBob	Here's your order, sir.
SpongeBob	What's the part two?
SpongeBob	Yeah, I know.
SpongeBob	Good, cause we're onto our next activity.
SpongeBob	I am!
SpongeBob	Who's the doctor here?  The last thing on the list is...
SpongeBob	Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward?
SpongeBob	You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay.  Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine.  Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry?  Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy.
SpongeBob	Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one.  I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January.
SpongeBob	Oh, good one.
SpongeBob	Pie...pie...  Oh, you mean  pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat!  Oops!
SpongeBob	Patrick and I visited the Pantanal region. Our blue arara friends were quite chatty. Here's one now, talking Patrick's ear off.
SpongeBob	You were always pink, Patrick!
SpongeBob	No, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Uh, Patrick, no it's not.
SpongeBob	Uh, but, Patrick, you are Patrick.
SpongeBob	We also turned on our superpowers for some lucha libre! If I was a luchador, I'd be Invincibubble! What would your name be, Patrick?
SpongeBob	In Spain, we went to Palencia's Arts and Sciences Center.
SpongeBob	Here are Patrick and I at La Cibeles Fountain in Spain. After football match victories, people come here to celebrate.
SpongeBob	What did you think it was?
SpongeBob	You took a siesta back at the hotel. Remember?
SpongeBob	When the weather gets cold and the water freezes over, many Russians love to go ice hole fishing. Just as many fish love to swim in the Russian waters peacefully, minding their own business. Not realizing that just above them, someone is plotting their doom.
SpongeBob	True that, brother.
SpongeBob	Patrick, you don't have toes.
SpongeBob	We made sure to visit the monastery at Mont-Saint Michel. Patrick, did you know that some monks take a vow of silence?
SpongeBob	Uh, this one was built first. But you know what they say, imitation...
SpongeBob	Look Mr. Krabs. I'm doing it, I'm doing it!
SpongeBob	SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	Sorry Mr. Krabs, I was just trying to protect the secret formula.
SpongeBob	Hi, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Hey Mr. Krabs, what happened to your metal pants?
SpongeBob	Whoa-ho, Mr. Krabs! I didn't know you had heat vision!
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs...  Wha...
SpongeBob	Isn't that a microphone?
SpongeBob	We stand on one foot.  Balance a glass of chocolate milk on our heads and sing the Bikini Bottom National Anthem.
SpongeBob	It's your rule. Never speak the formula. You told me to keep it in...this bottle.
SpongeBob	First question: What time does the Krusty Krab open?
SpongeBob	On Wednesday...
SpongeBob	Oop! Don't forget your lucky penny.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Any super awesome trip to Germany has to begin with the Hofbruhaus.
SpongeBob	At Bikini Berlin, we got to see a bunch of animals. It's just like Bikini Bottom, but with more monkeys.
SpongeBob	No, it's actually the city of Hamburg's harbor.
SpongeBob	I'm about the best you're gonna get.
SpongeBob	And here we are at the Brandenburger tour. One of Germany's best known landmarks.
SpongeBob	"Uh, Big Ben isn't a ""he"" Patrick. That's the name of the bell."
SpongeBob	For Patrick!
SpongeBob	Those lions won't hurt you Patrick. Why they've been there for hundreds of years.
SpongeBob	Here we are in the Great Barrier Reef. It's so big, it can been seen from space. But back in Bikini Bottom. we call it the big city!
SpongeBob	"In Australia, we visited the Sydney Aquarium where some of the ocean's most dangerous criminals are locked up and came with an idea for a hit TV show, ""Sponge is the New Black""."
SpongeBob	Oh, Bondi Beach. That's more my style. Hello, beautiful!
SpongeBob	Why do you want an endless summer, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Fun and profitable! Big business does it again. I just wish it could be the endless summer right now!  Hey!
SpongeBob	Look at the bright side, Mr. Krabs! There won't be a line to go in the pool!  Caaannnooonnnbaaaalll!!!  Ouch!
SpongeBob	Plankton. A thank you would be nice.
SpongeBob	Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas?
SpongeBob	All right, stand back, everyone.
SpongeBob	Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me?
SpongeBob	I'll take a banana split.
SpongeBob	You know what would go good with that?
SpongeBob	A tailor.  Because I ripped my pants!
SpongeBob	Ouch.
SpongeBob	I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...
SpongeBob	Absolutely, buddy.
SpongeBob	Sorry, but I don't speak Italian.
SpongeBob	Look at him Patrick, isn't he great? Hey, little fella.
SpongeBob	Aw, don't be sad, Patrick. It's only until tomorrow.
SpongeBob	Quick, Patrick! We need to make a run for the door!  Noo! Patrick, he's blocking our only exit!
SpongeBob	No it might eat Sandy! We go to get it out of here!
SpongeBob	Hold on Patrick.
SpongeBob	We're in serious danger. There's a-a-a...a monster out there.
SpongeBob	A living nightmare!
SpongeBob	It ate them! And there it goes!  First Wormy, then Squidward, Mr. Krabs!  That flying monster has eaten three friends too many. We must warn the citizens! Evil has surfaced. The fate of Bikini Bottom is in our hands, Patrick. Now let's roll.
SpongeBob	Monster!
SpongeBob	Talk to me, Krabs.
SpongeBob	You got a family, Phil?  Come on, Phil, stay with me. Let's hear about that family.
SpongeBob	Hooray! Gary! I had that dream again! And its finally going to come true!  Today! Sorry about this calendar.  Because today is the grand-opening ceremony for The Krusty Krab 2, where Mr. Krabs will announce the new manager.
SpongeBob	...ee, la da doo, la da dum, Bum Bum Bum, Da da da...
SpongeBob	I just wanted to say I'll be thanking you in my managerial acceptance speech today.
SpongeBob	We're going to the place where all the action is.
SpongeBob	I'm ready,promotion... I'm ready,promotion...
SpongeBob	Well, good luck with that.  I'm ready. Promotion. I'm ready. Promotion.
SpongeBob	He's right.
SpongeBob	Hold the phone, folks, I'm getting an important news flash from Mr. Krabs. Go ahead, Mr. K.  I'm making a complete what of myself?  The most embarrassing thing you've ever seen?  And now it's worse because I'm repeating everything you say into the microphone?
SpongeBob	I'm not... mature?
SpongeBob	No, Pat, you don't understand. I didn't get the promotion.
SpongeBob	I'm gonna head home, Pat. The celebration's off.
SpongeBob	Ooh!
SpongeBob	Waiter.  Oh, waiter.  Waiter.  Wai-toor.  Waiter!
SpongeBob	My friend?  Patrick. Hey, what's up, buddy?  Wait, you said 8:00. I'm late for work. Mr. Krabs is gonna be... Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	I now realize that he's a great big jerk! I deserve that manager's job! But you didn't give it to me, because you say I'm a kid. Well, I am 100% man! And this man has got something to say to you.  There, I think I made my point.
SpongeBob	Doesn't it seem a little harsh to kill someone over a crown?
SpongeBob	But I'm not a kid. I can do it.
SpongeBob	What's in here?
SpongeBob	Patrick and I...
SpongeBob	The Patty Wagon. Mr. Krabs uses it for promotional reasons. Let me show you some of its features. Sesame-seed finish, steel-belted pickles, grilled-leather interior. And under the hood, a fuel-injected french-fryer with dual overhead grease traps.
SpongeBob	Fill her up, please.
SpongeBob	That's right.
SpongeBob	That's what I'm talking about. Yeah!
SpongeBob	Yeah. Victory.
SpongeBob	The key!
SpongeBob	I know. I'll go in and create a distraction, and you get the key.
SpongeBob	Patrick! You call that a distraction!?
SpongeBob	Don't sing along, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Come on, Pat, one more time.
SpongeBob	Oh, have I met this friend?
SpongeBob	Plankton!
SpongeBob	He's closing in!
SpongeBob	Wrong channel!   order, sir!
SpongeBob	Now what?
SpongeBob	I guess this means that the secret formula is safe forever. Right, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Give me that!
SpongeBob	Wait a minute... I think I forgot to empty Gary's litter box today.
SpongeBob	Jimmy... Back my formula? Hmm. Ohhhhhhhhh!! I get it!
SpongeBob	But...but, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Stop! All right, Mr. Krabs. Let me get in on this.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, you may not understand what I'm about to do today.  But someday, we'll look back and have a good laugh.
SpongeBob	You know I can hear you, right?
SpongeBob	Teamwork.
SpongeBob	"Team. Now say ""work."""
SpongeBob	Come on, Plankton, it's easy, It means I help you, you help me, and when we accomplish our goal, then we do hands in the middle.
SpongeBob	It's me, your best friend, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob	No, that's not what happened. It just disappeared. We're putting a team together to find it.
SpongeBob	Patrick-  Patrick, why are you doing this?
SpongeBob	Sandy! The lack of Krabby Patties has driven her mad.
SpongeBob	But it means Gary is close by. Gary, I'm back! Whoa.  Oh, hey, Gary. Plankton and I need you to help us find the Krabby Patty formula and fix Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	What do you mean seize them?
SpongeBob	Everything we know and love has been destroyed.
SpongeBob	Yeah, I guess you're right.
SpongeBob	Plankton? Oh, Plankton, I just had the craziest dream, and you were in it.
SpongeBob	What were you doing in there?
SpongeBob	That is a horrible way to live your life.
SpongeBob	Not without a time machine.
SpongeBob	I am?
SpongeBob	I've never seen  there.
SpongeBob	We better hurry. Those guys really hate tires.
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah, good thinking.
SpongeBob	Oh.
SpongeBob	I've never carried a head before.
SpongeBob	Hey, my pitch pipe.
SpongeBob	A .
SpongeBob	Cheese!
SpongeBob	Yes, Patrick. It's--
SpongeBob	Where is the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob	So what's a dolphin doing out here in the middle of space?
SpongeBob	I'm watching.
SpongeBob	Let's give him a minute. He's been holding it for 10,000 years.  I'm pretty sure that wasn't supposed to happen.  Come on, Plankton we gotta clean this up before Bubbles gets back!
SpongeBob	And I'm  from the future!
SpongeBob	All right, Plankton.
SpongeBob	Oh, that was crazy.
SpongeBob	Patrick, wait!
SpongeBob	Well, Plankton, I guess we failed to accomplish our goals.
SpongeBob	I didn't know there were two bottles.
SpongeBob	NO!
SpongeBob	Oh, I'm not crying, Mr. Krabs.  I smell Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob	It's not about feet.
SpongeBob	Don't hurt us! We're sorry we got you fired!
SpongeBob	Guys, if Bubbles has the courage to quit his dead end nowhere job and travel back through time to help us, then we need to have the courage to--
SpongeBob	Farewell, Bubbles!
SpongeBob	What?  A giant, hairy porpoise! It's beached! It's suffering. Poor thing.
SpongeBob	Excuse me, do you know where we can get a Krabby Patty around here?
SpongeBob	Wow.
SpongeBob	[gasps] Lean!
SpongeBob	Well, there was this magical dolphin from the future who shot us out of his blowhole and then--
SpongeBob	Sandy, you're smart.  You have any ideas?
SpongeBob	I'm gonna write us an ending.
SpongeBob	Aw, shucks.
SpongeBob	What do you have to say about this, Gary?
SpongeBob	Here you go, sir.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
SpongeBob	OK. Prepare yourself, Mr. Krabs. Don't bother sitting down, Mr. Krabs, because you'll just stand up when you see this!  Ta-da!
SpongeBob	Stop it!  I know this is a good idea. I'll show you! I'll... I'll... I'll open my own restaurant!  You'll see!
SpongeBob	I have a good idea, and no one else thinks so!
SpongeBob	What if Mr. Krabs was right? Maybe my idea is dumb.
SpongeBob	Yes, sir! We sell Pretty Patties!
SpongeBob	At first we didn't know what to do with all the money. We tried burying it...
SpongeBob	But in the end, we decided just to give it all away.
SpongeBob	No, sir, I haven't. Sometimes I really miss the old days back at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	You will?
SpongeBob	I can't feel my legs, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Wow, a golden spatula!
SpongeBob	Do you know how lucky you are to have a friend like me?
SpongeBob	Let an old pro show you how to do it.
SpongeBob	You taught me a valuable lesson.
SpongeBob	Shut your mouth you mediocre clarinet player.
SpongeBob	Hi, Grandma!
SpongeBob	Tell me another story about when I was a baby.  Three o'clock? I'm gonna be late for work!
SpongeBob	Did I do something funny?
SpongeBob	Really? You do, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Thanks, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Tax exemption.
SpongeBob	Patrick, we didn't say that.
SpongeBob	He is right, Grandmother. Kisses are for babies, which I am no longer. I have grown up. It is nature's way.
SpongeBob	Sorry, grandmother, we adults don't partake in the consumption of sweets, right, Pat...  ...rick?
SpongeBob	Grandmother, I need to have a mature conversation with Mr. Patrick.   Patrick, what do you think you're doing? Cookies? Warm milk? A bib?  Is that a kissy mark on your forehead? We are supposed to be adults!
SpongeBob	It appears to be my lunch hour. Grownups have to eat to. I guess this will have to do.
SpongeBob	Oh, uh... great. Yeah.  Fascinating. No pictures, just the way I like it.
SpongeBob	Uh, I don't need to leave yet. I can be late for work.
SpongeBob	Out into the cold, grown-up world alone without a sweater.
SpongeBob	"Soo long...  I don't wanna grow up!  I want cookies!  and ""milkie""!  I want a sweater with love in the stitches!  I wanna wear ""diadies""!  I wanna ride in my wagon!  I wanna cuddle-wuddle with Mister Stuffykins!  I wanna rocky-rock on my seahorsey!  And I want kissy-kissy on my boo-boo!"
SpongeBob	This is gonna be great!
SpongeBob	Huh?
SpongeBob	MR. KRABS!!!! I never even got a chance to tell him that I...
SpongeBob	We haven't improved Squidward's day yet. Let's do his house!  My turn.
SpongeBob	Let's do your house, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Here it is, Patrick. Now we've just got to convince Squidward to come back home. You got the apology cake?  We're ready!
SpongeBob	Patrick, look! It's Squidward!  Squidward! We finally found you!
SpongeBob	Any one of these Squidward's can be the real Squidward, Patrick!
SpongeBob	I am raking the leaves.
SpongeBob	Can I do that?
SpongeBob	But Sandy, that only gives us 1, 2, 3...  168 more hours of playtime!
SpongeBob	Ride!
SpongeBob	Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice any of my time that I haven't already sold to Mr. Krabs to you.
SpongeBob	Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again.  Good night Gary.
SpongeBob	Sandy, are you sure we're supposed to be standing up here?
SpongeBob	Well, it's just that I'm feeling sort of...  I just feel like maybe I need to...
SpongeBob	Gotta hide! Gotta hide! Home? No. Gary can't keep a secret.  Under a rock? It's so original!
SpongeBob	Sandy, wait!
SpongeBob	But, Mr. Krabs,  what about all the stuff you stole?
SpongeBob	Then you bought it?
SpongeBob	...And Plankton's lawn mower?
SpongeBob	What do you want to do today?
SpongeBob	It's okay, Patrick. There's lots of money in  the First National Bank of SpongeBob.  Follow me!  Uh-oh. I'm broke, too.  and Maybe we could borrow money from Squidward?
SpongeBob	We're going to have so much fun! First we can run with the balloon!
SpongeBob	And in a plane!
SpongeBob	I got the pieces!
SpongeBob	We're thieves!
SpongeBob	It's not safe for Bikini Bottom anymore. We've got to move fast and cover our tracks.
SpongeBob	We're going to have to travel lighter.
SpongeBob	No more Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	And  all that running is good for your buns and thighs, right?
SpongeBob	Okay, we still can't do that!  But at least we don't have to shave.
SpongeBob	What are you talking about? Taking the balloon was your evil plan.
SpongeBob	Not just any rectangles... Candy bars!
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Here Patrick, just take half of mine.
SpongeBob	"It's ""pants on fire"", Patrick."
SpongeBob	[] Not if I tell on you first!
SpongeBob	What are you going to do to us?
SpongeBob	I sure am!  I'm ready!
SpongeBob	Christmas who?
SpongeBob	And everyone pretends to like the fruitcake.
SpongeBob	Okay, who's next?
SpongeBob	C'mon, Squidward. Write a letter.
SpongeBob	Santa doesn't come till Christmas Eve.
SpongeBob	What did you wish for, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Gee, Squidward, maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said. Okay, everybody, we've got a lot to do now that we've summoned Santa Claus. We must ready ourselves for his arrival.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squidward. I'll help you get started.  Dear Santa Claus...
SpongeBob	But, Squidward, when Santa comes, you'll be the only one without a gift.
SpongeBob	C'mon, Squidward. C'mon!
SpongeBob	Hey, guys, where's your Christmas Spirit? He's just running late.
SpongeBob	You were right, Squidward. This is a stupid holiday.  I still want you to have this.
SpongeBob	I guess I won't be needing this.  That's better.
SpongeBob	Hello? Yes. Who's there? Huh? Hello? Show yourself. Yoo-hoo. Hello? Who is it? Huh?
SpongeBob	S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... ta...
SpongeBob	Where's your reindeer? And your flying machine?
SpongeBob	I did?
SpongeBob	Alright, we're gonna go to Sandy's house! Yeah! Ha-ha! Keep the tree warm, Sandy, we're on our way to your house! Ha-ha-ha...
SpongeBob	Patrick, listen, how many times do we have to-?
SpongeBob	Patrick! Put your helmet back on!  You know there's no water in Sandy's house!
SpongeBob	Let's check it out.  Look what's in Sandy's bed!
SpongeBob	Oh, you better run faster, Sandy.
SpongeBob	Ha! That  really disturbing!
SpongeBob	Sandy, it's us, your friends! SpongeBob and Patrick!
SpongeBob	Well, that oughta work.
SpongeBob	They couldn't afford station wagons either!
SpongeBob	I say I'm Dirty Dan.
SpongeBob	I'm Dirty Dan!
SpongeBob	I'm Dirty Dan!
SpongeBob	Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again!
SpongeBob	N-n-n-no.
SpongeBob	The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?
SpongeBob	Look at all that warm, toasty fur!
SpongeBob	Well, I guess I've lived a full life!
SpongeBob	Let me see that roll of tape.
SpongeBob	Spring?
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Sandy, we've got you covered.
SpongeBob	Gary and I are playing tag, you wanna join us?
SpongeBob	Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gar-Bear to get going. Come on, Gary.  Boy, I can't wait to hit the hay.  What about you, Gary?  Gary? Gary?
SpongeBob	Hey, that's a great idea!
SpongeBob	Hey guys, how was the sleepover?
SpongeBob	What's that supposed to mean?
SpongeBob	And now Lary, I present to you dinner time! Ta-da!  Bon appetite, Lary.  OK, maybe later.  This is where you sleep, Lary.  Uh, that's where I  I guess you can sleep there  I'll just sleep down here.  Well, good-night, Lary.  Hey Lary, want to hear a joke? Aw, Gary used to love this one!  What do you call a snail on a ship? A snailor!  Don't you get it Larry? A snailor.  Gosh, Lary is sure different than Gary. And Gary and Lary are real different than Jerry.  Oh Gary, why did you have to go?  Why, Gary? Why! Why, why, why, why, why!  Gary?
SpongeBob	Laundry? But we used to do laundry
SpongeBob	Gary?
SpongeBob	What happened?
SpongeBob	That's enough time, I can make up those points!
SpongeBob	Whoo.
SpongeBob	What was that, Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	Extra credit!
SpongeBob	Got to sharpen my pencil.  N e
SpongeBob	Don't look! It's not ready.
SpongeBob	It's not ready yet.
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything.
SpongeBob	Look out Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants.  SpongeBob SquarePants. SpongeBob SquarePants.  La La La La!  La La La La!
SpongeBob	For me...?
SpongeBob	Hey, I'm driving!  Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask?! Because you're not skiing!  Oh my gosh, I know who you are!
SpongeBob	I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were   Mrs. Puff?  So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff?
SpongeBob	Free driving lessons!
SpongeBob	Wait! We made a net especially for you!  Do you want to come with us?
SpongeBob	No, are you kidding? We're his best friends.
SpongeBob	Us!  Let's go!  Welcome home, Squidward!
SpongeBob	But what is best is what we saved for last. The one sure-fire thing to make your best day ever  best day ever!
SpongeBob	Hey look! Squid's doing it!
SpongeBob	Yeah, you got Squidward! You got it Squidward!
SpongeBob	This is really your best day ever, isn't it?
SpongeBob	Oh, great.  Hey Squid! How about that...  ...best day ever?
SpongeBob	Wow! We're actually here at the biannual Jellyfish Convention!
SpongeBob	Look! Dr. Manowar! The guy who got stung by Big Lenny and lived!
SpongeBob	If I could just touch the hem of his pocket protector, then maybe some of his greatness would rub off on me.
SpongeBob	Hi, Kevin.
SpongeBob	No, wait! I would do anything for you!
SpongeBob	I'd love it!
SpongeBob	Hey, I caught one! Am I a Jellyspotter now?
SpongeBob	It tickles my nose!
SpongeBob	Am I in the Jellyspotters now?
SpongeBob	Now?
SpongeBob	A queen? Can I help?
SpongeBob	Hey, where are you going?
SpongeBob	But Kevin, I was your biggest fan!
SpongeBob	Now what do we do?
SpongeBob	Hi, Patrick!
SpongeBob	Oh my gosh, Patrick. This is the greatest wall of superhero super gadgetry ever! I'm going to play with the Cosmic-Ray!
SpongeBob	What is it trusted sidekick?
SpongeBob	We could get in trouble.
SpongeBob	Well, uhh, Mr. evil ManRay sir, we can't do that.
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Well, that's good enough for me.
SpongeBob	Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle...
SpongeBob	Nuh. Wrong.  Good people don't rip each others arms off!  Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggle with a heavy package. What do you do?
SpongeBob	Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad.
SpongeBob	No. Please.
SpongeBob	That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat.
SpongeBob	Wait! I don't have a license.
SpongeBob	Doy.  Man-Ray!
SpongeBob	I hope I do as good as that guy.
SpongeBob	Umm, noxious gas?
SpongeBob	I mean, hey, you could land a plane on those things.  And what's up with all that squirrel fur? I guess fleas need a home too.
SpongeBob	I never thought I could be a head-liner! Whatever that is.
SpongeBob	Did you enjoy the show?
SpongeBob	La-la-la-la-la-la. Squirrely, squirrely, squirrely, squirrel. Because they're stupid. Because they're stupid.
SpongeBob	Ah, that's just Patrick. He's just fooling around.
SpongeBob	Thank you, you're too kind. Hey, what about this water! I mean, the stuff's everywhere.
SpongeBob	Howdy, y'all!  How come it takes more than one squirrel to screw in a light bulb?
SpongeBob	You did it SpongeBob. You get to keep your career and your friends.  I'm glad that Sandy can finally see the genius of my comedy.  Good morning, Sandy.
SpongeBob	But Sandy, that, that's not a...
SpongeBob	Wa...
SpongeBob	Sandy! Ok Sandy, I get it!
SpongeBob	Now let me tell you about those fish? Boy are they smelly. Whoo-hoo! I mean how can a creature that spends so much time in the water smell so bad? I mean, really!  Soap... soap... what is... soap?  And don't even get me started on starfish!
SpongeBob	A flower.
SpongeBob	Yeah.
SpongeBob	"Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby, and if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength!  What do you think about that, ""Miss Mittens""?"
SpongeBob	Aaaaah!
SpongeBob	I can underwater! I'm...  Hydrodynamically designed!  Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?
SpongeBob	I did! And I took a head start like you did!
SpongeBob	Kite flier!
SpongeBob	Good one, Squidward!  Woo!
SpongeBob	Most importantly...can you do this?
SpongeBob	Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. At least until they need to breathe...  Yep, won't be long now. [] Feelin' light-headed yet?
SpongeBob	Actually, you know, but...
SpongeBob	Where not afraid of your dumb old land!
SpongeBob	Thanks Mr. Krabs Ok! Here I go!  Hey, this isn't so bad. We can do this! Hey, Patrick, come on up! The air is fine!
SpongeBob	Come on, Squidward, you're missing all the dry. Come on, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Hey, a local. Hi, we're from underwater. Do you know Sandy Cheeks?
SpongeBob	There it is... Oyster Stadium. Not only do they have the largest oyster held in captivity, it also does tricks!
SpongeBob	Come on, come on, wake up already!  I think it's working!
SpongeBob	Uh...
SpongeBob	Give it a rest, Patrick! There's no crime to investigate! Now go home!  Stupid Patrick, I didn't do anything wrong. Ah, what am I getting so worked up about? I'm sure that by tomorrow, this whole ugly mess will be a funny memory!
SpongeBob	Sorry, neighbor.
SpongeBob	Um, actually, I-I'm just talking hypothetically.
SpongeBob	Um, have you found out anything?
SpongeBob	Twitchy? Twitchy? Who's twitchy? I'm not twitchy! Sorry Sandy, I have to, um... um... go get my hair cut!
SpongeBob	Y-y-yes.
SpongeBob	Yes!
SpongeBob	Wait! Stop! I'm the one you want! I am the criminal!
SpongeBob	I am the one who threw the peanut! I know now that what I have done is wrong. So I say, I am sorry, giant performing oyster. I am sorry, Patrick. I am sorry, citizens of Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob	Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside!  Holy shrimp!  Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward!  Squidward! The sky had a baby!
SpongeBob	Wouldn't that be the top?
SpongeBob	No, look, a giant ship!
SpongeBob	Doesn't this place seem familiar?
SpongeBob	"No, no, it's not ""rawr!"""
SpongeBob	Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all?
SpongeBob	No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman.
SpongeBob	Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
SpongeBob	Let's see who we can find.  Captain, there's a guy we can scare.
SpongeBob	You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good.. You're good. You're good.  Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
SpongeBob	Really?! What is it?
SpongeBob	Wait! Listen!
SpongeBob	Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?
SpongeBob	Well, that's not right because...
SpongeBob	That's not gonna do it! Think harder!
SpongeBob	Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian!
SpongeBob	"Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch  Huh? ""New"" Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm."
SpongeBob	Why no, Gary, this isn't the bathtub. [Kicks away a paint can] It's treasure. Look, doubloons.  Don't drop 'em... Look at this brooch!
SpongeBob	I am so the boss of you!
SpongeBob	Yeah, yeah, Gary. I'm getting behind my ears.
SpongeBob	Why would you play cards with him?
SpongeBob	Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob	Good one, Mr. Krabs. Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	Actually, uh, Mr. Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh...
SpongeBob	But this grill is not a home. This is not the stove I know.
SpongeBob	Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	A little more to the left.
SpongeBob	Almost! That's it, just a little more...perfect! Right there! I don't know, it still doesn't feel right.
SpongeBob	Well...
SpongeBob	All this preparation is making me hungry.
SpongeBob	Tell you what, half-pint: why don't you ask me later!
SpongeBob	My brain and I are glad to be back, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	Scissors beats paper, Patrick!  One...
SpongeBob	It is a giant pencil, Patrick!  Let's draw some giant pictures with it.
SpongeBob	Eh, everybody's a critic.
SpongeBob	It means we found a magic pencil!
SpongeBob	Okay! Why didn't you say so? Hey! Another jellyfish!
SpongeBob	Hey! My brain just hatched an idea.  This is gonna be classic!
SpongeBob	He's knocking on the door.
SpongeBob	What have I done? We've got to find him! Where could he possibly be?
SpongeBob	Come on, Patrick. Give me a boost up!
SpongeBob	You okay, Patrick?
SpongeBob	He's putting down the pencil! This is our chance. On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him!
SpongeBob	Hold it right there, Doodle. I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out. Any last words?
SpongeBob	Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen?  I nose.  Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn.  Well, doodle, it looks like this is a draw.  You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school.
SpongeBob	No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose.
SpongeBob	Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing?
SpongeBob	It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets.
SpongeBob	You wanna hear one of my secrets?
SpongeBob	"Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think Jelly-Fishing and Bubble-Blowing are the  ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word ""fancy"" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear right now."
SpongeBob	But, Patrick, I must know the secret!
SpongeBob	So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?
SpongeBob	I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up.
SpongeBob	Uh
SpongeBob	If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside.
SpongeBob	It's just a string.
SpongeBob	Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty.
SpongeBob	Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' gift to all of Bikini Bottom -- the Krabby Patty..
SpongeBob	Okay Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow!
SpongeBob	No.
SpongeBob	A booster seat? .
SpongeBob	Good night Gary.
SpongeBob	Help!
SpongeBob	No, never!  You can't fool me Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty secret formula!
SpongeBob	I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down.  I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down, you delicate little Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob	Well patty, I guess we can go home now.
SpongeBob	What kind of monsters are we? That poor creature came to us in his hour of need, and we failed him. Squidward's always been there for us when it was convenient for him. Evelyn, when your little Jimmy was trapped in a fire, who rescued him?
SpongeBob	Now let's make Squidward proud. A 1, a 2, a skiddly diddly doo.
SpongeBob	Maybe we're in one of those toxic waste dumps.
SpongeBob	Isn't this great Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working!  It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease!  Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!
SpongeBob	Hey Squidward. Guess what, I'm chopping lettuce...at night.  Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night.  I burned my hand!...at night.  Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! Night!
SpongeBob	You're right!  For the Krusty Krab!  Piece of cake!
SpongeBob	Tell me! Tell me!
SpongeBob	The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa.
SpongeBob	He didn't wash his hands?
SpongeBob	So?
SpongeBob	But tonight's Tuesday night!
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	Isn't this great, Squidward?  There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day.
SpongeBob	Nice try, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Well they're dropping someone off.
SpongeBob	Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!
SpongeBob	I see her, Mr. Krabs.  A Krabby Patty with cheese. The classic.
SpongeBob	She doesn't like to talk about it.
SpongeBob	Hi, Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob	Don't move!
SpongeBob	Psst, Mr. Krabs, say hello.
SpongeBob	Oh, uh, I think Mr. Krabs is saying that he'd like to... hit you with a rake!
SpongeBob	...on a date!
SpongeBob	Lucky hankie?
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob	I wish there was some way I could help.
SpongeBob	But you said...
SpongeBob	But you said...
SpongeBob	Psst, Mr. Krabs, we're just going for a walk in the park, remember?
SpongeBob	But...
SpongeBob	"Wait! Don't tell me. You want me to run down to the store and buy Mrs. Puff something she doesn't need! Then you want me to run back here so you can say,  ""Arrgh, SpongeBob! You're spending all me money!"" And then I'll say, ""But Mr. Krabs, I'm only doing what you said!"" Then you'll say, ""We're not talking about this...""  ...""Or this""...  ...""we're talking about this!"""
SpongeBob	Well, Mr. Krabs. Do you want to know what I think?  Arrgh! Regga flebba breeka brecka smullen-ellen Mr. Krabs! Yegga hegga mergin wallet! Dimmy middy spend! Rivy flivy diva shiva Mr. Krabs Wallet!
SpongeBob	Yeah, I know!
SpongeBob	Gary! Hey hey hey Gary! How's my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up something to eat?
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, whatchya up to?
SpongeBob	Uh...Marco!
SpongeBob	I can't write on an empty stomach Gary, I gotta have my brain food! Now let's see...White or rye bread...or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese  A visitor? For me!?  Hello!
SpongeBob	So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain...
SpongeBob	Oh no! Midnight!  Must.. get... back to desk!  Whew, that was a close call.  Ah! My pants!
SpongeBob	No!  What have I done?!  Help! Help! My house is on fire!
SpongeBob	But what about my essay?
SpongeBob	But, Patrick, the only thing I've ever seen you clean is your plate.
SpongeBob	Hey, a note!
SpongeBob	No, they don't, Patrick. Parents just like to push your buttons. Like this!  Nauuugh!
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Patrick! I'll be the dummy! When your parents see how dumb I act, they'll think you're the smartest guy ever!
SpongeBob	What could go wrong?
SpongeBob	Hi.
SpongeBob	Patrick, meet me in the kitchen!
SpongeBob	I'm only  to be dumb! It was our plan, remember?!
SpongeBob	But... but, but, but, but, but, but...
SpongeBob	Noooo!
SpongeBob	Takin' out the trash, takin' out the trash.
SpongeBob	Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick, do you know what this word means?
SpongeBob	Oh, I get it! Let me try.  Hello, Patrick. Lovely  day we're having, isn't it?
SpongeBob	It tingles when I laugh!
SpongeBob	Attention, customers, today's special is a  Krabby Patty served in a greasy  sauce and grilled to  perfection.  And don't forget to ask us to  the  fries. It will be our  pleasure.  Hi Squidward, how the  are ya?
SpongeBob	Wow, 13!
SpongeBob	Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes!
SpongeBob	Escalators, Escalators, Escalators!  Eels?
SpongeBob	I didn't mean... you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying...what I meant to say was...some things just slip out. You gotta understand!
SpongeBob	I can run faster than you!
SpongeBob	He said, he said, he said!
SpongeBob	Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in the 13 words you said shouldn't be said.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that.
SpongeBob	That's all 13, Patrick!!  We're gonna tell your mom, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?
SpongeBob	Yes, please.
SpongeBob	If I'm lucky,  Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art.
SpongeBob	Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try.  Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog. That's you on the bottom.
SpongeBob	How's this Squidward?
SpongeBob	Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness.
SpongeBob	Really?
SpongeBob	Squidward, look. It's ol' Bold and Brash!
SpongeBob	I don't know, Squidward. That stuff's not in the book.
SpongeBob	First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept.
SpongeBob	I've gotta lick the marble!
SpongeBob	But, one more thing.  There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in.  It looks like the excitement of my artistic triumph is too much for Squidward. Oh, well, back to the dump.   To the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. To the dump, to the dump, To the dump, dump dump.
SpongeBob	I'm going on my lunch break, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	It's just a little ol' Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly! I call it a Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly.
SpongeBob	You okay Mr. K?
SpongeBob	But, sir, how many jellyfish do you need?
SpongeBob	Here you go, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	It feels like somebody... wants to sell me something!
SpongeBob	No Name, let me out! What are you gonna do with me? Pee-yew! What smells like big business?  Hey, I don't remember that factory!  Huh?  What is this horrible place?
SpongeBob	Oh, boy! A tea party!  You tricked me, Mr. Krabs! I wouldn't have collected all those jellyfish if I knew that this was their fate! This isn't right! Jellyfish need wide-open space and fresh air!
SpongeBob	And now I'm gonna set these jellyfish free!
SpongeBob	"He really got burned on that deal!  All is as it should be.  I promise never to use this jellyfish net for anything but pure sport again. Jellyfish aren't meant to be captured forever!  Oh, No Name! I guess I can name you now. I'll call you... ""Friend."""
SpongeBob	To bring home the gold is to bring honor and glory to the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Hi, Patrick.
SpongeBob	You have to be a fry cook.
SpongeBob	Hey, flipping is not as easy as it sounds!
SpongeBob	You don't even have fingernails.
SpongeBob	Pink!
SpongeBob	Well, it doesn't matter anyway 'cause you're gonna eat my dust.
SpongeBob	I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. I thought Patrick was my friend.
SpongeBob	No!
SpongeBob	Make way for the real fry cook, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Laugh while you can, Pinky. It's not over yet.
SpongeBob	Pink!
SpongeBob	You too, Patrick.
SpongeBob	18... 19... and... 20. Here you go, Mr. K. I think this should cover all my nonsense. Oh, and here's an extra fifty cents for when I was tying my shoe.
SpongeBob	Wow! You and me go on strike?
SpongeBob	Right!
SpongeBob	Hey, guess what, Mr. Krabs? Me and Squidward are going to go on strike!
SpongeBob	Yeah, yeah!
SpongeBob	Sorry.
SpongeBob	Like this, Squidward?
SpongeBob	At the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob	Yep!
SpongeBob	Like this, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Alright, Mr. Krabs. You've gone too far this time. You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader. We are workers united! We're tired of your smelly greed! And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer. And we're gonna... we're gonna... Squidward, what was that other part?
SpongeBob	Hey, Squidward. I bet old man Krabs is going to break any day.  Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward?  Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward?  Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Here it comes!
SpongeBob	Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that.
SpongeBob	What's that?
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah? Well it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway!  Aww, tartar sauce!
SpongeBob	Oh, boy, now's my chance!
SpongeBob	Hold on!
SpongeBob	Are you kidding? I've been playing bassinet for years!  Give me an A, buddy!  Squidward is my best friend in the world.  Squidward is my best friend in the sea...
SpongeBob	...So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me!
SpongeBob	Buddy?!
SpongeBob	I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy...  Say, what gives? I'm not sitting near that maniac!
SpongeBob	Wait, I need some more!
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Psst, I think he's jealous.
SpongeBob	What? But Sandy, you don't know what you're up against. We're talking about an Alaskan... Bull... Worm!
SpongeBob	Wait! Sandy!
SpongeBob	You'll get massacred!
SpongeBob	Um... in my pocket.
SpongeBob	Oh yeah? What if I said... 'blargen fedibble no-hip'?
SpongeBob	No, not tough enough. Not tough enough!
SpongeBob	You do.
SpongeBob	Ain't nothin'  too big or too ornery for you to catch. But...  But...  And...  We...  I...  Yeah but...
SpongeBob	Sandy, are you sure you...?
SpongeBob	Sandy!
SpongeBob	That's not the worm. That's his tongue.
SpongeBob	Ah, he is too big for you, isn't he?
SpongeBob	Say it, or I'll trip you!
SpongeBob	I knew it.
SpongeBob	"I'm way ahead of you, Sandy.  Look, it's a necklace! S for ""SpongeBob"" or S for ""Sandy""! That way they can identify our bodies."
SpongeBob	Order up! Two deluxe Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob	I'm afraid you can't do that, Mr. Plankton!
SpongeBob	Well, it's just that it's Tuesday again, sir, and I was wondering if I could have my, um... weekly performance review!
SpongeBob	But sir!
SpongeBob	Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...
SpongeBob	A pro- a promo- a promotion?!
SpongeBob	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...
SpongeBob	A customer ordered a medium soda, and I gave him a large! I gave him a large! I've soiled the good Krusty Krab name!
SpongeBob	He's around here somewhere.  There he goes!
SpongeBob	Yeah, but the worst part is...
SpongeBob	You'll never get this formula, you twisted fiend!
SpongeBob	Can you believe that sun?
SpongeBob	I don't know. Let me check.  Looking good. How's yours?
SpongeBob	Who needs to be a lifeguard? I'm cool.  I'm every bit as cool as Larry. And if I'm not, let me be struck by...  ...a flying ice cream truck.  AND LIVE!
SpongeBob	You really think so?
SpongeBob	It works.  Woohoo! That was the greatest, Larry.
SpongeBob	Action?
SpongeBob	Uhh, somebody went?  No, don't go!  Free ice cream!  Plenty for everybody. One for you, one for you... OK everybody got one?  A-ha, now I got ya! Now, you all have to wait one hour before you go swimming.  But just so you're not tempted...  Ladies and gentlemen of the lagoon is closed.
SpongeBob	If there was anyone in there, we'd hear them.
SpongeBob	OK, I'll take a look, but just to prove to you that...  ...PATRICK ISN'T DROWNING!
SpongeBob	Oh, what am I going to do? Got to think.  Gotta think. Gotta run around and think. Gotta run around and think at the same time. Gotta think, gotta have a plan. Gotta think, think, think.  I've got it!  Patrick can't drown if there isn't any water.  Well, you're safe now, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Yes, Larry?
SpongeBob	Widward's woing to work.
SpongeBob	I don't know. Something about his nose?
SpongeBob	Oh, cheer up, Squid. It could be worse.
SpongeBob	And besides, we have
SpongeBob	Oh, Magic Conch Shell, what do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?
SpongeBob	Once a member, always a member!
SpongeBob	Squidward, are you all right?
SpongeBob	Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever. I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers.  You're on your way. I bet you're thirsty.  Huh?  I'm not taking my eyes off you.
SpongeBob	Whoa girl. Now you wait out here until I'm done with work. See you at the end of my shift.
SpongeBob	I knew I should've named her Debbie.
SpongeBob	No, Mystery, you can't come out yet. If old man Krabs sees you, I'll lose my job.  I bet you're hungry. How about some lunch?  Shhh! Girl, you got to be quiet or...
SpongeBob	Did you look under the tray?
SpongeBob	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you Squidward. I'll be right back.
SpongeBob	Mystery got a belly-ache from eating Krabby Patties, so I made her a bi-carbonated soda.
SpongeBob	What happened to the dollar, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	Good one, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Sorry, Squidward, it's just so funny. You know what we say.
SpongeBob	I'm sorry... I don't...
SpongeBob	If you try it, you'll love it!
SpongeBob	Whoop! What's that in your ear?
SpongeBob	No, Squidward, I meant... good for your .
SpongeBob	One bite?
SpongeBob	One bite.
SpongeBob	Ahhhhh...  Eeeeee.... Oooooh-oooooh-oooh...
SpongeBob	Are you sure?
SpongeBob	Yes, Squidward?
SpongeBob	Noooope, a patty this special should be eaten fresh, and... well... I haven't had one of these babies in over twenty minutes, so...  Well, whoever they were, they had great taste!  Ahh, they don't know what they're missing. Well, back to work!
SpongeBob	I always come to work at 3am. This is when I count the sesame seeds.  What are you doing here?
SpongeBob	And why are you acting so nervous? And why are you sweating so much? And why do you look so hungry? And...
SpongeBob	No, worse, it'll go right to your thighs!
SpongeBob	I was just wondering...  ...is it the homework pencil on the left side of the paper next to the quiz pencil, or over on the right side all by itself? Or...
SpongeBob	That joke was almost funnier the second time.
SpongeBob	Yes, Mrs. Puff.  Sorry, Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob	Really? What's it say?
SpongeBob	Patrick, listen! It's me, SpongeBob! I need your help!
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff, can I be in a different class?
SpongeBob	Well, okay. But only if you promise to keep it between us.
SpongeBob	Yes, Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob	Okay, see, I didn't know where else to turn! Patrick couldn't help me, and Mrs. Puff only made it worse. I sit next to your son Flats in school, and he is a fine boy and all, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but he wants to kick my butt.
SpongeBob	Hey Flats, you feeling better?
SpongeBob	Oh Gary, I'm too young to have my butt kicked! There are so many things in life I haven't gotten to do!  Hang on, I'll transfer your call.  Who is it?  Flats!
SpongeBob	Hold on.  Okay, I'm ready.  I said I'm ready.  Didn't you hear me? I said I'm ready.  That tickles.  Gary, I'm absorbing his blows like I was made of some kind of spongy material! Do you known what that means? I get to go to work tomorrow!  Flats, are you okay?  Do not cheer me, my fellow adult classmates. Flats was the real victim here. A victim of a society that's riding down a violent road to nowhere; a road I call...  ...'violence road'.
SpongeBob	Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up!  He wants one of everything.
SpongeBob	More Diet Red Tide?
SpongeBob	Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor.
SpongeBob	I bet he bites whale bubbles.
SpongeBob	I call it the 'Nasty Patty'.
SpongeBob	Why, sir?
SpongeBob	You're right, Mr. Krabs, I'm guilty. I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me.
SpongeBob	There's a big rock in the way!
SpongeBob	Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought he might need some air.
SpongeBob	Mr. Krabs, I'm too young to go to jail!
SpongeBob	I understand, Mr. Krabs, but what do you want me to do with the bo...
SpongeBob	The dark deed you requested is done, sir.
SpongeBob	He wears curlers to bed!
SpongeBob	See anything yet, Patrick?
SpongeBob	30 more seconds, Patrick.
SpongeBob	Squidward, we don't need a television. Not as long as we have our...  ...imagination!
SpongeBob	Okay, Squidward, but if you change your mind, we'll be in this box!
SpongeBob	Underwear!
SpongeBob	Take it easy, Patrick, you've got to acclimate!
SpongeBob	Our voices!
SpongeBob	Because I already cut off my own arms!
SpongeBob	And...  ...imagination.
SpongeBob	We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Squidward, don't you see? Waiting and watching? That's not what the box is all about! It's about...  ...imagination.
SpongeBob	Ahoy matey!
SpongeBob	Good night, Patrick.
SpongeBob	I know! Let's go see Squidward!
SpongeBob	Can I have your autograph can I have your autograph can I.. they're gone!  Mermaid Man's belt!
SpongeBob	There you go. Come again, sir.
SpongeBob	Nothing.
SpongeBob	Me, uh, either.
SpongeBob	Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure! Please don't tell!
SpongeBob	Don't!
SpongeBob	Uh... uh, okay, uh...
SpongeBob	No! I can't let you do that! But there must be someone else who can help! Someone smart and wise, with years of life experience.  Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!
SpongeBob	Patrick!
SpongeBob	You think so?
SpongeBob	Patrick, I don't think Wumbo is a real word.
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too!
SpongeBob	Sandy!
SpongeBob	Oh Squidward, he'll be so disappointed.
SpongeBob	Mermaid Man? I'm so sorry, it's just that I'm such a big fan, and your belt, and...
SpongeBob	I'm ready, Squidward!
SpongeBob	Okay, see you on the road. I'm ready! Here I come, Mrs. Puff! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
SpongeBob	The bow.
SpongeBob	Oh, in this boat right here?  Is it time already?
SpongeBob	The boat?
SpongeBob	Okay, floor it.
SpongeBob	No, Gary, I'm not walking.
SpongeBob	Okay, now what, Patrick?
SpongeBob	Pat, don't do that.  I've got too much to worry about.
SpongeBob	How are we going to do that?
SpongeBob	Moo.
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!
SpongeBob	1924?
SpongeBob	I'm cheating?! Mrs Puff!
SpongeBob	I do have an antenna under my hat.  There is a guy giving me all the answers. It's all true!  I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating!
SpongeBob	No... I'm cheating...!
SpongeBob	No...!
SpongeBob	Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob	Wait, I can do this, Mrs. Puff, I can do this!
SpongeBob	Hey, look at all those police! I wonder if the president's in town.
SpongeBob	Class just isn't the same without Mrs. Puff. Just the thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. I don't know how she's going to survive.
SpongeBob	Alright, put the money in the bag!  Put it in!
SpongeBob	Sure.  Here ya go.
SpongeBob	Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get into jail this time.
SpongeBob	Darn it! Ok, Patrick, let's get out of here.  No, wait!  There goes our deposit on these costumes.
SpongeBob	'Cause we're gonna set you free!
SpongeBob	Oh, that's crazy, Patrick.
SpongeBob	We've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. Mrs. Puff, if you come with us, I'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom.
SpongeBob	Mrs. Puff, up here.
SpongeBob	Whoopee!
SpongeBob	Well, first, you have to make a snowball.
SpongeBob	Oh yeah.
SpongeBob	Patrick, you fool! This was over before it started! I will now consider your unconditional surren-...  ...-der.  So that's how he wants it to go down.
SpongeBob	Then that means he's on my side!
SpongeBob	We signed a peace treaty, Squidward.  You were right, fighting is for children.
SpongeBob	He's a good leader.
SpongeBob	Forts win wars, Squidward.
SpongeBob	Exposed.
SpongeBob	Hmm... looks like it's time for Plan B.
SpongeBob	Hey, Patrick, look at this thing. Pretty cool, huh?
SpongeBob	Eeh... ooh...!
SpongeBob	I'll be right back.  Mr. Krabs, I found 68 cents. But maybe you can take the other $4.32 out of my paycheck! What do you say?
SpongeBob	Hey, Mr. K. How's the antique biz treating you?
SpongeBob	I'm not?
SpongeBob	Uh-uh.
SpongeBob	Seems a little dangerous.
SpongeBob	Oh, my gosh! A floating shopping list!
SpongeBob	What guy?
SpongeBob	Immediately?
SpongeBob	Hey, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob	It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number 1!
SpongeBob	It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number on-
SpongeBob	Squidward said I could help by burying myself!
SpongeBob	Yeah, I got butterflies, too. This is the most exciting thing to happen in the history of history.
SpongeBob	Look, Gary, there I am again. Look!
SpongeBob	Top of the morning, oldster.
SpongeBob	"""Weren't you that guy on TV?"" Yes! I am that guy.  How kind of you to notice. Weren't you that guy on the television last night? Yes, that was me. I..."
SpongeBob	You're on your way.
SpongeBob	No problem, Squidward. I got one already made out. Enjoy.
SpongeBob	Well, maybe just one.  Another one? Okay. Limbo. And now, the, uh, oh, I got it.
SpongeBob	Solo record!
SpongeBob	Come on, Krabs. Let's think outside the box for a second. Commercials are old-hat. The people want music. If I could change fate I would, Krabsy. And I'm an entertainer deep down. A people's person. We're on the same page here, aren't we?
SpongeBob	No can do, Squidward. These people demand entertainment.
SpongeBob	"I'd like to call this little number ""Striped Sweater."" The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time. One with a collar, turtleneck, that's the kind  'Cause when you're wearing that one... special... sweater...  Squidward, this crowd is insatiable."
SpongeBob	Uhh, what do you call a vampire whose car breaks down 3 miles from a blood bank? A cab!
SpongeBob	No!  My career is over. All those years clawing my way up. All the people I've stepped on. Wasted.
SpongeBob	It seems to be working. But how do I follow it up? Buns!  It's a stretch, but we've all got to push the envelope, sometime. Okay, folks. How do you like this?
SpongeBob	I'll say. I'm so glad I gave up fry cooking for this.
SpongeBob	Clause 3b: The provider reserves the right to be unfair.
SpongeBob	But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy. And what could be better than serving up smiles?
SpongeBob	Cookies!
SpongeBob	Squidward? Squidward, is that you?
SpongeBob	That's great. And have you been doing with yourself? No wait, let me guess...Hmmm...I see you've been working on that mustache, the tattered clothes, the awful smell...you're a football player?
SpongeBob	Even your paintings?
SpongeBob	Ahh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Here comes the plane.
SpongeBob	Good night.
SpongeBob	Gary! Squidward is not a freeloader and he would never take advantage of me.
SpongeBob	I know he still isn't looking for work! Don't rub it in!
SpongeBob	Why not?
SpongeBob	Hmmm, that's two things in this house that won't work.
SpongeBob	Oh, OK. How about this?
SpongeBob	I've got a better idea! Why don't I call someone whose  it is to fix it?  You know why? Because when I want a   done I get someone with a   to do that !
SpongeBob	Listen, you crustaceous cheapskate! Squidward's been living at my house, driving me crazy! And you're not going to hire him back all because of a stupid dime?!  What's that?
SpongeBob	Ah, yes. How foolish of me.  Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit.  And I won't do anything else.
SpongeBob	Great minds think alike, I suppose.
SpongeBob	"Oh, I get it. She's ""Sandy."" That's her name; she's also covered in... yes!"
SpongeBob	Wow.
SpongeBob	Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes.
SpongeBob	What weenies. Oh brother.
SpongeBob	I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie!
SpongeBob	Hey, everybody, what's goin' on?
SpongeBob	Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch.
SpongeBob	Patrick, what're you doing here?
SpongeBob	Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it!
SpongeBob	Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury.
SpongeBob	Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners!
SpongeBob	I did?
SpongeBob	Weenie Hut General?
SpongeBob	Do other restaurants do that?
SpongeBob	Every sentence, every paragraph...  Spoons! Bread! Salad! Pepper! Don't you understand?!  My brain is full to bursting! If I have to memorize a single order, I think I'm gonna explode!
SpongeBob	Table for Hommina? I can seat you immediately!
SpongeBob	Thank you, sir.
SpongeBob	My name?
SpongeBob	My name?
SpongeBob	Ugh, I got such a headache. What's going on with you?
SpongeBob	Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right?
SpongeBob	Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose?
SpongeBob	Well, keep your eyes peeled.  They're everywhere. Back to work!
SpongeBob	Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's...  ...a robot? Nah.  Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot!
SpongeBob	Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it.
SpongeBob	Hey, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob	That's the final test, Squidward. The love test. Robots can't love.
SpongeBob	Squidward?
SpongeBob	Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries.
SpongeBob	I don't know.  Hey, a nickel!
SpongeBob	Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information.
SpongeBob	Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob	Where's Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob	"Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his ""little buddy."""
SpongeBob	I also said they couldn't love.
SpongeBob	Gary, the paper's here!  You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section!  I am a happy sponge!
SpongeBob	Alright, quit messing with me, I know you said something.
SpongeBob	No, Patrick, he's just a baby.  He's all alone with no one to take care of him.
SpongeBob	I've got just the thing.  How would you like a Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob	French fries?
SpongeBob	Well, you should be good for the rest of the...
SpongeBob	How did you know?
SpongeBob	I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.
SpongeBob	Me neither.
SpongeBob	Can you take care of him? My hands are kind of full.
SpongeBob	Ok.
SpongeBob	Patrick, what about my break?
SpongeBob	Patrick, I really need my...
SpongeBob	Patrick Star, we need to talk.
SpongeBob	Yeah, once.
SpongeBob	Hmmm?  Hmmm?  Hmmm!?
SpongeBob	Six o'clock.
SpongeBob	Oh, nothing.
SpongeBob	"Does...  ""You can take the night off, pal!""  ...ring a bell?"
SpongeBob	So! This is work?
SpongeBob	Oh, boy, yeah, you're working!
SpongeBob	You never help!
SpongeBob	Junior? Hey, he's flying!
SpongeBob	Despite all we've been through, it was worth it.
SpongeBob	But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad.
SpongeBob	Patrick, we're not getting paid at all.
SpongeBob	We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick.  Now that's what I'm talking about. Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now.
SpongeBob	I'm thinking I should do this one too, Patrick.
SpongeBob	I'm getting to the painting.
SpongeBob	I don't think this bubble can get much bigger!
SpongeBob	Ok, this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off.  There! I think I got it.
SpongeBob	Did it work?
SpongeBob	Nothing's working!
SpongeBob	Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick, no!  Nowhy'd you put it in the...  Grab it, Pat, grab it! Hurry, hurry!  Aww, Pat, no, no!  Get it, Pat, get it, get it, get it!  Oh, no-ho-oh!
SpongeBob	We're all done, sir. Everything looks great.
SpongeBob	It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!
SpongeBob	No, Mr Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!
SpongeBob	Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!
SpongeBob	Carry 'em yourself, Fishface!
SpongeBob	No can do, ya Brainless Lab Rat! I have better things to do than to be your test monkey!
SpongeBob	...to ditch you...
SpongeBob	No! Why would I want to be friends with a big loser like you?
SpongeBob	Quiet, you!
SpongeBob	No, you don't scare me, Girly!
SpongeBob	I'm sorry I caused all this. I'm not scared of going outside anymore. But I'm terrified of gorillas now.
SpongeBob	What?
SpongeBob	...then you should visit Sensei Cheeks!
SpongeBob	Oh that's nice!
SpongeBob	We can play fetch when I get home, Gary. Right now Mr. Krabs needs me. There's leftovers in the fridge if you get...
SpongeBob	Well, this looks easy to remember. It's just a little black smudge.
SpongeBob	"""Nor... mal."" Got it."
SpongeBob	What's next on the list?
SpongeBob	Really sure.
SpongeBob	Why are you wearing that funny thing on your head?
SpongeBob	That's right. Exit the tree...
SpongeBob	It's just so hard to leave, even for one night!
SpongeBob	That's okay. I'll tell you.
SpongeBob	"Seats taken, sir. Ooh, the movie's starting! preview  all audiences -""Fisherman 4: Attack of the Hook."""
SpongeBob	Uh, sorry, sorry, sorry!
SpongeBob	Patrick, I'm getting scared. Hold my eyelids open.
SpongeBob	Oh, no, we missed the movie.
SpongeBob	Okay, buddy. Sleep tight. I'll see you tomorrow.
SpongeBob	We're too scared.
SpongeBob	Oh, no, I will not think about the Fisherman! Sleep tight!
SpongeBob	That thing's eating Squidward!
SpongeBob	Maybe even a thousand!
SpongeBob	But like anything in life, it's not complete without a pickle. Hey! The last one! Come on little fella. Fulfill your destiny.
SpongeBob	Now let's see, if I'm going to catch Patrick, I must first think like Patrick. Look, Jellyfish! Try to say 'hi'. Aren't they pretty? You know, if you're gentle, you can pet them. Look it's Patrick! Hey Patrick, I need that pickle to complete the patty! Hey, that looks like the back of the  sign. ?!!! Neptune on a needle! This is gonna get a little vertical! You OK new guy? Well, at least the bubble bike made it. Hey! Let go!
SpongeBob	Why did you steal my pickle?
SpongeBob	Never! You can't make me!
SpongeBob	No! You can't have it! You can't have it! No! My baby!
SpongeBob	No pickles. Ha ha ha.
SpongeBob	Im sorry, Mr. Krabs. I failed you.
SpongeBob	Wow! Polka dots!

SpongeBob	AAAAAAAAHHH!!!!
SpongeBob	Bye, Sandy!
SpongeBob	Goofy Goober's Ice Cream Party Boat!
SpongeBob	Okay!
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	It's shaping up to be a wonderful holiday. Not your normal, average, everyday.
SpongeBob	Even all the trash, on Christmas it smells so sweetly! This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas to me!
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	Up, up, and away!
SpongeBob	Let go!
SpongeBob	A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
SpongeBob	Bad word?!
SpongeBob	Mmm-mmm...!
SpongeBob	You  care!
SpongeBob	Squidward!
SpongeBob	Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Again! Oh, yeah! Again!
SpongeBob	To the club!
SpongeBob	Yeah!
SpongeBob	See you later then.
Squidward	Oh no, SpongeBob. What could he possibly want?
Squidward	You're terrible! A hydro-what?
Squidward	Could we show a little decency and form a neat, single file line in front of the register?
Squidward	Oh Mr. Krabs!
Squidward	Hooray,
Squidward	Mr. Krabs! Mr. KRABS!  Mr. Krabs, come see your new employee!
Squidward	Uhh, Mr. Krabs...
Squidward	That's not what I had in mind!
Squidward	Just do what you do in school.
Squidward	Back it up!
Squidward	NO! SpongeBob! You did it wrong! Gimme the wheel, SpongeBob. Give me the wheel! Give me it!
Squidward	Ow, ow ow.
Squidward	What is it?
Squidward	Well Who cares about the customer?!
Squidward	Ow.  SpongeBob, let go of that pizza!
Squidward	Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers?
Squidward	Trust me, I know where I'm going.
Squidward	Give it to me!
Squidward	Just a peek.
Squidward	And the pepperoni?
Squidward	Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob!
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	Sure, we're saved. Now give me some pizza!
Squidward	SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae! And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive...  ...rocks? Hold on there, Jethro!
Squidward	He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite.
Squidward	I'm getting paid overtime for this, right Mr. Krabs?
Squidward	Patrick, go be stupid somewhere else.
Squidward	Patrick, if I could make a suggestion. Why don't you just order a Krabby Patty?
Squidward	Not bad.
Squidward	They're entrepreneurs. They sell things to people.
Squidward	But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restraunt?
Squidward	I don't.
Squidward	Ah, Make-Out Reef. Good times, good times.
Squidward	Huh?! No, no, no, I'm NOT the Quickster! I'm Captain Mag... [coughs, then melts to pile of ash]
Squidward	Sir, let's just get this out of the way, I hate everything on the menu! Now, what do you want?
Squidward	See? I told you.
Squidward	Pamper Island?
Squidward	No.  And to think I could be wearing a powdered wig right now.
Squidward	So, some trip, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Squidward	We're gonna die out here just because a clam ate Mr. Krabs' stupid dollar!  Well, if he wants his dollar back, I say we give it to him. Know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Squidward	A sandwich? You expect me to break my back over a sandwich?
Squidward	Just look at him.
Squidward	You're crazy. If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?
Squidward	Why did he have to go like this and leave me tied to this idiot?!
Squidward	A-ha!  I can't believe it's finally here!
Squidward	Pfft, dream on, SpongeBob.  I wouldn't let Snellie here play with that mongrel mutt. She's a purebred.
Squidward	No, SpongeBob. You can't enter Gary because Gary's a mutt.
Squidward	Don't waste your breath, SpongeBob. That mongrel of yours doesn't have a chance against Snellie.
Squidward	Well SpongeBob, I must admit, I didn't think that mongrel mutt of yours would even find the starting line. Congratulations.
Squidward	Go, Snellie, you got it, baby!
Squidward	But that's impossible. If Snellie didn't win, then...
Squidward	SpongeBob! Patrick! Do you mind?!
Squidward	Whatever.  Here you are, sir. One Krabby Patty.
Squidward	SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back.  Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe.
Squidward	Should be over in a couple of hours. Have SpongeBob send back a patty and an iced-tea, will you?
Squidward	Me too, how are we going to get paid?  Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well.
Squidward	You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny.
Squidward	Hello?
Squidward	What's going on here?
Squidward	H-h-huh?
Squidward	Uh oh yeah, sure.
Squidward	Yeah. Me, too.
Squidward	Hello, Mrs. SquarePants! Let me help you with these bags.
Squidward	Forever?
Squidward	Is this where the line starts?
Squidward	You mean this morning?
Squidward	SpongeBob, it's not camping if you're ten feet from your house.
Squidward	Oh. Bye.  You little sneak! I see what you're doing!
Squidward	"Aah. You're saying I'm soft! You think your little ""have fun inside"" challenge is gonna make me come camping with you, but that is never gonna happen! There's no way I'm gonna sit out here all night with you two losers! So, get used to it!"
Squidward	It isn't put up yet, you idiots!
Squidward	Why would I bother? We're ten feet from my house.
Squidward	No! This is relaxing.
Squidward	There's no such thing! They're just a myth.
Squidward	You're right! I should be more careful. In fact, why don't you tell me all of the things I shouldn't do if I want to keep the sea bears away?
Squidward	Go on.
Squidward	Wow! That's amazing how many things can set a sea bear off!
Squidward	Yes.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Well, I guess I'll just have...
Squidward	Move over!  Hey, it worked! You guys saved my life!
Squidward	Uh, SpongeBob?
Squidward	SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world?
Squidward	Oh, sure, sure.  A genius? Well, how about... Hey!
Squidward	Fascinating.
Squidward	Another day, another migraine. Heh, heh, mi...
Squidward	Yeah.
Squidward	Whatever. Huh?  SpongeBob, don't you know who that is?
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	Zip it!
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, he is not normal.
Squidward	Oh, brother.  Number 5. Number 5!
Squidward	SpongeBob! SpongeBob, open up!
Squidward	Yeah... now please leave me alone.
Squidward	You mean I got out of bed for nothing?
Squidward	So am I.
Squidward	Oh, I see. You're just kissing up to the boss to make me look bad. Well, I won't stand for it. Gimme that card.  Trying to outsmart me, will ya?  There, I signed it for all of us.
Squidward	What? Haven't you ever heard of a bank?
Squidward	What? Where? Lemme see. Where?
Squidward	And nothing's meaner than a junkyard worm. He'll eat you alive!
Squidward	What are you morons doing?
Squidward	Retriever to worm bait, stay in. Don't go out.
Squidward	Good. Then make lots of noise to draw the guard worm away from the mattress so I can retrieve it.
Squidward	Alright, you two, what's the holdup?
Squidward	"Okay, so you are dressed as choice cuts. You go in there and yell ""Trick or treat!"" The worm will realize he forgot to stock up on Halloween candy, he'll leave to buy some then we take the mattress."
Squidward	Oh, I give up.
Squidward	What are those Neanderthals up to? Don't they know I'm busy spoiling myself?
Squidward	What is it?
Squidward	All right, all right.  Oh, boy, what fun.
Squidward	Haha, good luck. You'll
Squidward	Ha! If you think you're winning that thing again
Squidward	Ha! I'm not falling for that malarkey.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	If I can just win once, I'd never play again!
Squidward	Yes.
Squidward	Yeah!
Squidward	Oh, that's ludi...
Squidward	But this is my last quarter.
Squidward	I am a winner, aren't I?  Winner, winner, winner!  Wiiiiiinner!  I'm a winner, everybody! You hear that?!  I'm... a winner.
Squidward	You didn't win the prize?
Squidward	I think I had the magic touch.
Squidward	Be the crane.
Squidward	Oh, uhh, be the crane. Be the crane.  Look out, SpongeBob. I can't stop!  Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the crane. Okay, don't be the crane! Don't be the crane!
Squidward	SpongeBob...
Squidward	You did overlook one teensy little detail, however.
Squidward	What are you two idiots doing?!
Squidward	The what? Is this some stupid club you two made up?
Squidward	Oh, no! It's already noon! I will be darned if I let those morons eat up anymore of my valuable Sunday!
Squidward	No really, I'm fine. Please, Ino, uhh
Squidward	Alright, you two! Out!  And don't even think about dragging your empty skulls around here for the rest of the day. Or tomorrow or next week.
Squidward	No, you aren't! You're horrible neighbors!  And stop calling me president!
Squidward	That oughta do it! Let's see those imbeciles try to get in here now!
Squidward	GRRR, you infernal contraption! I'm gonna ship you off to the scrap heap you came from!
Squidward	This Sunday relaxation really hits the spot.
Squidward	Get out of my house! Huh?
Squidward	Fantastic.
Squidward	Ahoy there, mateys. Welcome to Krabby O' Mondays.
Squidward	Sincere service with a smile.
Squidward	They're watching us.
Squidward	Oh, hey Carl, uhh, I was just reminding Eugene about article 24 section 3 of our employee handbook.
Squidward	More like another nickel.
Squidward	Here's your food.  It's not that funny!  Please make it stop!
Squidward	Shh, shh, shh.  You're burning up, SpongeBob.
Squidward	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Unless you've been doing a lot of laughing.
Squidward	Yes. What? No! Listen, SpongeBob, this is serious. If you burn your laugh box you live your whole life without ever laughing again.
Squidward	Ah, it sure is peaceful around here since SquarePants became a sad sack.
Squidward	SpongeBob, this infernal crying has to stop.
Squidward	Yeah.  You really fell for it.
Squidward	Break your laugh box! What a schlemiel. I will yahhhh!
Squidward	Gimme that. I can never laugh again?
Squidward	Uh, no thanks. Who wants to be the 'makeup department'?
Squidward	As they'll ever be.
Squidward	How original.
Squidward	Thanks, Farmer Brown.  It's been a thrill serving you.
Squidward	We serve  here, sir.
Squidward	Patties are done.
Squidward	Oh, boy.
Squidward	Well, here we go again.
Squidward	Sandy, was this your doing? You've got to get us separated.
Squidward	It's no use, Sandy. We're still the same.
Squidward	Ow, ow, ow. SpongeBob! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
Squidward	I don't have time for this. I've got to man the cash register.  Whew. Can I help you?
Squidward	Sandy! Sandy! Please tell me you've figured out a way to separate us.
Squidward	What? Day after tomorrow?! No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No! I have a performance tomorrow! I can't be stuck to that yellow freak.  Sandy, please, you've got to do it before the show.
Squidward	You're right. The show must go on.
Squidward	Huh, no wait. Wait!  Oh, my one moment of fame... gone.  There's got to be some way to reverse this.
Squidward	SpongeBob?
Squidward	Where are all the new hotel employees?
Squidward	Patrick, you only live 400 yards away. Why do you want to check into a hotel?
Squidward	Close enough. Here's your room key.
Squidward	Take Patrick and his bags to his room.
Squidward	Fine. Let's go, Patrick.
Squidward	Enjoy your stay.
Squidward	Happy?
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, this is ridiculous! Patrick's being completely unreasonable!
Squidward	That's it! I've had enough!
Squidward	"I need a vacation. I'm overworked. And what better place to relax than Krusty Towers? Where ""we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request""."
Squidward	And you can carry me to my room.
Squidward	And I want it here in 5 seconds.
Squidward	These don't taste like anything mom used to make!
Squidward	Hm, just one teensy tiny problem. This room is hideous. Redesign it. Neptune the 14th would be nice.
Squidward	Oh, before you leave, I wanna go swimming.
Squidward	No, I'm good.
Squidward	Go away!
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	Uh, Squiddums loves his mama.
Squidward	SpongeBob?
Squidward	I'm sure she'll love it, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	Boys Who Cry? They're my favorite band. They charge a million dollars just to show up. And if you want them to lip-sync, it'll run into real money.
Squidward	It is dishwater.
Squidward	Hmph, No one's ordered the monster patty in ages. SpongeBob, one monster patty.
Squidward	Nice outfit, SpongeBob!
Squidward	SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty.
Squidward	I'm not rushing perfection. I'm rushing you.
Squidward	No, I don't, and neither does Mr Krabs.
Squidward	I'm not cryin'!  Ow. Ow.
Squidward	As long as there's no singing.
Squidward	I got my wish. You two are stuck in a dark hole and away from me.
Squidward	I gotta get out of here.
Squidward	Could you not stand so close? You're making me claustrophobic.
Squidward	Oh, sorry, SpongeBob.
Squidward	No, like this!
Squidward	Free. I'm free!
Squidward	You got it, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	Hey, SpongeBob...  Keep your shell vermin off of my property! The next time, my annoyingly yellow neighbor, your wet pet oozes on my lawn, you leave me no choice but to call Snail Control. That little monster...  He bit me!
Squidward	All of his shots?
Squidward	Bronchitis, lumpy-bump trump, teen angst?
Squidward	Well, after I was bitten by a mad snail, I began to get a rash; followed by loss of balance, ticklish rib cage, and a few other symptoms.
Squidward	I thought you were on vacation.
Squidward	SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please.
Squidward	One shell on a shingle.
Squidward	Oh yeah, how could I have missed it?
Squidward	Mr. Krabs!  I've served a lot of junk here, but a hair patty?
Squidward	That wasn't a compliment! The entire town is laughing at you!
Squidward	That wig is infested with parasites.
Squidward	Sponge...
Squidward	I didn't. It was SpongeBob who...
Squidward	Are you sure this is safe?
Squidward	I heard that!
Squidward	Oh, of course. I've got  head shots, you know.  What the...
Squidward	Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not in control of my actions.
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Good morning, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	Hi, Patricia. I drew this for you.  Likeness is uncanny, if I do say so myself.
Squidward	Are you sure about Saturday night?
Squidward	It's too quiet. Something isn't right around here.  Could it be? SpongeBob is gone for the evening.  Here's to a delightful evening alone with you, public television.
Squidward	You're still there, aren't you?
Squidward	That's it! All I wanted to do was watch some smooth jazz on public television. But apparently, that's not going to happen. Once again I'm going to have to leave my own home just to get some peace and quiet. Enjoy my TV.
Squidward	Brine soda, low-fast seaweed crisps, cool jazz.  Mm, mm, Squidward you have done it. You have officially spoiled yourself rotten.
Squidward	I don't care where I'm going, just take me away from here.
Squidward	Hello, sunshine.  What a beautiful morning. Just perfect.
Squidward	No, it's not great! It's horrible. Oh, that's it. Stop! People of Bikini Bottom, stop! Stop! Patrick's no king. Look at him. How can this pink blob be king?
Squidward	See? See? You're not a king. And now, they all think so,  too!
Squidward	That's no pet, that's a wild animal.
Squidward	Grr! Eighteen hours!  I'm going to give that SpongeBob a piece of my mind!
Squidward	Uhh, w-wait, I can turn it down.  Everybody's a critic. You won't be hearing from me anymore.
Squidward	Get a good grip on your pants.  Turn around.
Squidward	No, I don't.
Squidward	Has it ever crossed your mind that you might be getting all worked up over nothing?
Squidward	What?  Gimme that.  Don't just stand there, save us.
Squidward	Woo-hoo-hoo!  Ride to live and live to ride!
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, we haven't sold a single soda in days.
Squidward	No, and leave me alone!
Squidward	Okay, SpongeBob, you hide first.  Oh, no, where'd he go? I guess he wins.  Defeat has never tasted so sweet.  Yello?
Squidward	I think that moron finally gets it! I don't want to see or hear him for the...  SpongeBob! Will you make that racket stop?! SpongeBob, you open this door right this...
Squidward	Hi. Now, SpongeBob, what the...?
Squidward	So, you'll be filling in for me when SpongeBob wants to play one of his stupid games?
Squidward	Oh, sorry, sir. Can I take your order?
Squidward	What the...? That's my joke!
Squidward	Oh, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	That was awful!
Squidward	You mean you're here to sign me up for a record deal?
Squidward	My dreams are crushed. But, hey, at least I won't see that Mini Squid ever again!
Squidward	But...
Squidward	Hey!
Squidward	Get on with it, SpongeBob.
Squidward	You already ordered.
Squidward	You're not being paid to love.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Well, hurry up. I gotta cry, too.
Squidward	No, thanks. I'm just doing this until my clarinet career takes off.
Squidward	Burning!
Squidward	Listen, you guys. I don't care or want to know what you do in your spare time. But could you turn off all these lights?
Squidward	Get away from me!
Squidward	Good. Now will you two be quiet?
Squidward	SpongeBob? Why are you all puffy?
Squidward	Oh, I'll help you, alright!
Squidward	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Squidward	No! No I didn't! It was SpongeBob! He's infected the entire Krusty Krab!!!
Squidward	Goodbye.
Squidward	I hate my job.
Squidward	Hey, use your mirrors, fool!
Squidward	A tropical getaway? On the triple decker Conhugo cruise liner? SunbathingParcheesiballroom dancing! This is going to be so easy. SpongeBob doesn't realize that I'm the face of The Krusty Krab. While he's isolated in the kitchen all day, Ill be out here, building a rapport with the customers.  Hello. May I get you anything else, Miss--
Squidward	I think you might need a closer look. Let me give you a hand.
Squidward	How in Neptune's creation do you know all these names, SpongeBob?
Squidward	Uh, that's, that's--
Squidward	Sure.
Squidward	Oh, I'm sorry, I slipped. Here, let me get that off of you.  Okay, there must be a name tag or some form of I.D. in here.
Squidward	Well, that's too bad, because I found what I was looking for.
Squidward	This isn't as it seems!
Squidward	Only 364 more days and 9 years left until I exchange this concrete tomb for a multi-story ocean liner cruise.
Squidward	Whoo-hoo-hoo! Tropical vacation, here I come!
Squidward	Oh, well. At least I'll have some peace and quiet for the next ten years.
Squidward	If you love it so much, why don't you just live here? [chuckling]
Squidward	In the dishwasher?
Squidward	No. Coming Eugene.  Good night's sleep, here I come.  And when I went home at night, guess what?
Squidward	Here you go.
Squidward	Ah! Eww.  Well, he may be twice as annoying at work, but it still beats having him as a neighbor.
Squidward	Oh, it's freezing in here.
Squidward	"""Do not touch thermostat ever."""
Squidward	I might need to bring a sweater. It's colder than yesterday.
Squidward	As long as you turn the heat up.
Squidward	I'm really glad I don't eat here.
Squidward	Pizzazz, huh? What would you know about ?
Squidward	A log cabin?
Squidward	That, I sculpted out the concrete foundation of The Chum Bucket.
Squidward	SpongeBob, I need that order of six.
Squidward	Right here, muscleboy.
Squidward	I wonder if it's too late to get a refund from my therapist.
Squidward	How could you possibly date anyone? I mean, look at you. She must be blind.
Squidward	I'll show you sick.
Squidward	That squeaking is gonna drive us all crazy!
Squidward	What are you two morons doing?
Squidward	You sneak into my house every morning?
Squidward	And with every fiber of my being, I know that I never want to see you two again--
Squidward	Get out!  Perfect.
Squidward	Huh? What? No! Get out!
Squidward	And the little scallops that nibble on your fingers when you feed them?
Squidward	Good morning, SpongeBob.  Hoooonk!
Squidward	I wanted to help you work.
Squidward	Who wants a free refill?
Squidward	Wow, SpongeBob! You've been Employee of the Month a gazillion times. I wish I could be employee of the month.
Squidward	I love being Employee of the Month.
Squidward	Oh, great.
Squidward	I'm worried he just left with my paycheck.
Squidward	I'll let you try one. Shove this in your face.
Squidward	Not bad!
Squidward	I got one last chance, I'll turn up the heat.
Squidward	What? What are you two doing?
Squidward	Oh, great. The flying Gyvonne Brothers. Just ignore them, Squidward.
Squidward	You actually got in?
Squidward	Excuse me?
Squidward	Doh, help me up.
Squidward	Fine. But I keep the trophy when we win, deal?
Squidward	SpongeBob, dancing isn't supposed to be fun. It's supposed to be art and art is suffering! Now, we'll start with some ballet. Watch my feet and follow my lead. Ready, and...pli.  Relev.  And now grand jet.  Where am I? See if I can find the lights.  Wait a minute.  This gives me an idea.  Ready, SpongeBob?
Squidward	Argh, hand 'em over.  And the other one, come on.  Ah, now that's more like it.
Squidward	What's that?
Squidward	Will you stop it? And let my dancing do the talking.
Squidward	Must finish dance... on other...
Squidward	Wait, SpongeBob, no!
Squidward	"But you said ""two."""
Squidward	That's what's causing all this? Only a complete moron would worry about what some critic has to say.  I rest my case.  Hey, in or out, mister. You're lettering out the A.C.  Weirdo.
Squidward	She is so tacky.
Squidward	Looks like some horrific shroud.
Squidward	Oh, clever.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs? Uh, this is a bad time, isn't it?
Squidward	What the heck is this stuff?
Squidward	Spongy Patties?
Squidward	Now, what's going on?  What is that horrible smell?  Is Patrick thinking again?
Squidward	Just ignore them, Squidward, and continue your power walk. Heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe.
Squidward	He took off his pants.
Squidward	Ok, that's enough.
Squidward	Oh yeah, you really touched his life.
Squidward	Discriminating tastes?
Squidward	It was that easy? All these years?  I've underestimated the power of public transportation!
Squidward	Oh! What  that?!
Squidward	You're pathetic!
Squidward	You're going to steal it!?
Squidward	Yes Eugene. The streets are lined with gold, and the street lamps are made with diamonds.
Squidward	That's just a painting you quarter-wit!  Quarter-wit. Ha, it's less than half. The real bubble lives in Atlantis, some darn old bubble hales in comparison to the art...
Squidward	Fabulous decor!
Squidward	As a connoisseur of fine art, I'm proud to say! I've always seen things in my own special way! 'Art'-lantis with their glorious aesthetics, I'll cop their style in a while- my art will be prophetic!
Squidward	You're standing on my neck!
Squidward	Somehow I knew I'd get stuck with you yahoo's the longest.
Squidward	Incredible!  The creativity! The artistry!  This painting is so realistic! It looks like you could step straight into it.
Squidward	I'm never leaving this place. I've learned more about painting in a few hours here than I did in four years of community college.
Squidward	But Atlantis was a fabulous, artistic paradise!
Squidward	Stop saying that!
Squidward	It was me, I said it.
Squidward	You two are harder to get rid of than cockroaches!
Squidward	It's not my birthday!  That's it! I'm moving out of this neighborhood!
Squidward	Neighbors. Uhh...
Squidward	Oh, I get it. You don't know what day it is, do you?
Squidward	Yeah! Normally, you're really loud and annoying, so what are you going to be today?
Squidward	Nearly noon and not a peep from SpongeBob!  I'm almost sorry I'm leaving!  Opposite Day.  SpongeBob, what are you...
Squidward	Out of the way, SpongeBob!
Squidward	Stop! Get away from her! Oh oh, I am so sorry, Ma'am, I hope these two barnacle heads! haven't harmed you in any way.
Squidward	Wait!
Squidward	Don't leave me here!
Squidward	Am I getting paid extra for this conversation?
Squidward	Now all we have to do is keep SpongeBob away from the...
Squidward	Don't you ever wake me up from my beauty sleep! Do you understand? Idiot Boy.
Squidward	If I knew that was the last time I've seen SpongeBob--  I would have slammed the door in his face even harder!
Squidward	I wouldn't seek out that twit for all the leotards of the sea.
Squidward	Don't just stand there, get in.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, I brought back your number one fry cook you gotta pay up.
Squidward	Welcome to the Krusty Krab. Where it's almost as if the evolutionary clock ticks backwards.
Squidward	Remind me to fire my therapist.  And stop bringing your neighbors to work!
Squidward	SpongeBob, you nincompoop! You broke my face! Don't just stand there, help me! I need a doctor!
Squidward	Come on. Spit it out. I cant take it.
Squidward	Well SpongeBob, earlier today my spine was hurting, now I'm resting on fine leather upholstery.
Squidward	Good morning my people! I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but even I  strange as it seems, need my beauty sleep.
Squidward	There's nothing a little foaming herbal bath can't cure.  Hey my grandmother gave me that soap! Well no one ever said it'd be easy being so handsome Squiddy. You'll just start getting used to..
Squidward	Come on, SpongeBob. Take the door and smash my face back!
Squidward	Uhh... okay, just let me just memori...  Dooowww! Hey, I wasn't ready.  Would you mind waiting till I...
Squidward	Got me into...
Squidward	I almost wish that meant something
Squidward	You called Ms. Gristlepuss a disgusting old prune and you threatened her with a french-fry strainer.
Squidward	"Did you just call me ""Squidwart""?"
Squidward	Oh.  Hello. Hello.  Hellooo!
Squidward	Wait, why did you ask me if I was watching House Fancy?
Squidward	It's simply glorious!
Squidward	Two hours? But I haven't even got time to wash my hair.  There's a stain on the rug! I'll just use this chair to hide it. There we go. Now I'll just...  There's a hideous hole in the wall! I'll just use this painting to cover it up. Perfect.  Oh no!  I'll never get this place in shape in time!  SpongeBob! How long have you been spying on me?
Squidward	Do you want me to get the cops down here again? Because...  All right, fine. But one slip up, and you are out of here. Comprendo?
Squidward	I don't care! Just use this paint to cover up that faded spot on the wall right there. Don't touch anything else!
Squidward	Hang on, I'm trying to get the grip on the thing. Now don't move it until I say...  Ow! Okay, it's on my foot. Now don't...  Ow!
Squidward	Oh no, they're already here! Go get a vacuum and clean up all the sofa bits. I've gotta run upstairs and dress my wound!
Squidward	Oh no!
Squidward	Yay!
Squidward	Well, I could help you, but I wouldn't soil my art playing Rock-N-Roll; dressing all in black, wearing boots covered in spikes  playing enormous stadiums filled with screaming, adoring fans  clapping, demanding encores, cheering me  Oh, uh, changed my mind. I'll join your band and help you bottom feeders  BUT I gotta get in shape first!
Squidward	My perfect dream-body.
Squidward	Don't talk to me.
Squidward	Never.
Squidward	Good evening,  and  welcome to the  Krusty Krab semi-annual charity night.
Squidward	That's it, a floor show! Wait, a talent show! With your host, me!  This is the moment I've...  I mean, we've been dreaming of. Think of it, Mr. Krabs, you will be responsible for bringing culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom! And not to mention, the money.
Squidward	What talent could you possibly possess?
Squidward	Alright people, listen up. Gather around everyone, chop, chop.  Now, you may be thinking this is your one shot at the big time. Well, it's not. It's mine.
Squidward	Ok, you get to mop up afterwards.  Now will you stop bugging me?
Squidward	Come on, come on, Ginsburg, if he doesn't hurry it up, we're not going to have time for the best act... me!
Squidward	And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. We've saved the best for last. Put your hands together for the incomparable Squidward!
Squidward	They want an encore!  Stand aside, SpongeBob!
Squidward	This is fabulous!
Squidward	Bikini Bottom Symphony Orchestra?
Squidward	Okay.  Get it together, Squidward. Put your game face on.  Heh, that's better.  Take your time with this one, Squidward, old boy.  Due tomorrow?!  Only one day to write my masterpiece!
Squidward	I'm a genius!
Squidward	Noooo!!!  Why? Why? Oh, why? (sobbing  Dowrgghgh!  I did it!  Hahahahahaha! Yes!  I did it! I did it! I did it! And I did it! Ha ha ha ha!
Squidward	Patrick, get off of me!
Squidward	By running around and screaming like a banshee?
Squidward	Well, how about you start by...  GETTING AWAY FROM ME, YOU LITTLE CREATURE!
Squidward	Normal, huh?
Squidward	Uh, yes... it is.
Squidward	Hi, SpongeBob.
Squidward	Yeah...  See ya.  Oh, my.  I could get used to this.
Squidward	Well, today is dusting day. The day I dust my 483 self-portraits.
Squidward	And stay out of my home!
Squidward	Yeah, whoo.
Squidward	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't move too much, it ruins it.
Squidward	Can I ask you something?
Squidward	This.
Squidward	Oh, yeah, that makes perfect sense. You're a half-wit who injured himself at work being a nitwit.
Squidward	Yeah, when Mr. Krabs finds out, oh, man.
Squidward	Here, let me take this for you.
Squidward	Oh, I believe you, SpongeBob, but, unfortunately,  the rules clearly state that you must be sent home.
Squidward	Well, maybe.
Squidward	You mean I can get paid while I'm at home?
Squidward	Huh? What's that? Hmm, must be hearing things.
Squidward	What is that noise?!
Squidward	"Don't you mean, ""Playing the slide whistle?"""
Squidward	I don't need zest! I need you out of my lampshade!
Squidward	Not the windows again!  Gotcha! They're gone. Whew! Now if they'd just stay out of my house, I might be able to enjoy a little squid time.
Squidward	I think I lost 'em.
Squidward	Well, uh...ha... that is true...
Squidward	Watch this!
Squidward	Would you like some more?!
Squidward	I've never felt so alive!  I don't wanna stop!
Squidward	What is it now Sponge...  Ghost? I'm sorry I was so mean to you while you were alive, please don't haunt me.
Squidward	Patrick?
Squidward	Oh, do you like to eat ice cream, Patrick?
Squidward	Hey!
Squidward	Fine! Why don't you two use it for your good deeds?
Squidward	Aha, they went this way.
Squidward	Yes, I'm sure!
Squidward	Well, pardon my anatomy!  What's happening?
Squidward	SpongeBob, get back here!
Squidward	Ow!
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Where are you?
Squidward	A giant clarinet?  And it sounds divine!  Now I'm too small to play my giant clarinet!  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever played!  Well, at least I still have my kelp garden.  What?  You cut it down?
Squidward	How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton? It hurts, doesn't it? I know!
Squidward	My floors! Think fast, squiddy. I've got your nose.
Squidward	Let's see Patrick destroy these.
Squidward	What are you doing with my cheese?
Squidward	Who cares? At least now that pink moron will leave us alone!
Squidward	A case like this?
Squidward	SpongeBob, I've been sitting here motionless for 45 minutes. What could you possibly have heard me doing?
Squidward	I don't care, what Mr. Krabs said! I just want.
Squidward	Huh? The key! Oh, where did I put that stupid...
Squidward	Yes?
Squidward	Bon voyage, nincompoop!  What the?  Can I help you, officer?
Squidward	Um, excuse me, there don't seem to be any empty seats left.
Squidward	Me?
Squidward	His side?
Squidward	Mm, bon appetite, Squidy.  You've ruined my morning, you've ruined my lunch, and you're ruining my...
Squidward	Just let go of it!
Squidward	Thank you.
Squidward	No no, I didn't. I never said that.  I don't need your help, and I don't need you!  Jerk!  All right, I said it. But that was before.
Squidward	Time can't be up. I didn't even get a chance to fill in a single answer. What am I supposed to do?
Squidward	Yeah, I'm just breaking it in.
Squidward	If it gets any hotter in here, we're gonna have to put fried calamari on the menu.
Squidward	They're at the beach.
Squidward	What next?
Squidward	Island?
Squidward	I bet this guy won't even be here. If he's anything like that last group of dirty drop-outs.
Squidward	Oh, my j-
Squidward	I don't know about you two, but I'd like to get out of here at some point, and if his idea of teaching us is...
Squidward	Oh, thank you. Thank you, SpongeBob.  Well, did you talk to him?
Squidward	Oh, oh. Please tell me you two didn't stare into that fire all night.
Squidward	I volunteer SpongeBob.
Squidward	I guess the Big One prefers a high-protein meal.
Squidward	Figaro, Figaro, Figaro!
Squidward	I am anxious to make a strong first impression, and share to my singing skills with the famed Bikini Bottom Mens Chorus.La-LALALAAA. But I needn't be too anxious, for once they hear this masters voice, they'll give me the Lead Solo for sure!Fi-ga-ro!
Squidward	Obviously depressed...
Squidward	Well, I have no time for the likes of you.
Squidward	No
Squidward	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Does that answer your questions?
Squidward	See you in nose-bleed seats!.
Squidward	Yuck!
Squidward	If that rank amateur SpongeBob embarrasses me in front of the Bikini Bottom Choir Men, my life is ruined!
Squidward	Your song? What are you, some kind of...
Squidward	Figaro! Figaro, Figaro, Fi-ga-ro!
Squidward	LAAAAAAAA!!
Squidward	That he found while cleaning out his attic over the weekend.
Squidward	Ay! What do you want?
Squidward	a race of scholars and scientists who lived before even Mr. Krabs was born.
Squidward	scrambled masonry on the weekends.
Squidward	Of course they do! How else Mr. Krabs come up with such a brilliant idea?
Squidward	Well, then why don't you go ASK THEM?!
Squidward	What the?! Hey! You can't do  thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-!!
Squidward	Ha.
Squidward	What the barnacles is going on down there?
Squidward	Hm? Oh! I couldn't be better!
Squidward	Thank you.
Squidward	SpongeBob! Patrick! Did you follow me here?
Squidward	Were you dropped on your head when you were a baby?
Squidward	Yeah.  I do, don't I?
Squidward	SpongeBob! Are they letting me back in the lodge?!
Squidward	Aaahhhh! .
Squidward	SpongeBob! That's not a secret hand-shake! Everybody knows Patty-cake!
Squidward	Are you insane? You kidnapped me?
Squidward	Eee-aahhhhhhh!
Squidward	Grrrr.  I don't want to be a Feather Buddy!
Squidward	One flaw?
Squidward	Unbelievable.
Squidward	Aaah! No!
Squidward	If you say so.
Squidward	That's probably because I've never visited you.
Squidward	Well, you made me spill pepper all over my imported rug!
Squidward	That's because I've never called you! Now, why have you stolen my vacuum cleaner?
Squidward	I just want my vacuum back...  You've made an exact replica of my living room!
Squidward	No.
Squidward	This is not a visit. You are going to get my vacuum.  And stop fluffing this pillow!
Squidward	Never mind. I'll find the vacuum myself!
Squidward	Oh, what a horrible nightmare.
Squidward	He copied all 492 of my self-portraits...  ...and they're better than mine!  He even got the rug right. Get a hold of yourself, Squiddy, old bean. This doesn't mean anything.  This...all of this is just...  Mimicry! He doesn't possess your style, or your decorating acumen, or your love of the finer things. In fact, the only thing that he has is... is... my vacuum cleaner! And I'll remedy that...  posthaste!  A-ha! He put you in here along with all his bad tastes! You're coming home...  Home... with me... with me...
Squidward	Why, yes, I'd love another spot of tea, Mr. Vacuum Cleaner.  Care for some casserole??
Squidward	Just ignore him. Maybe he'll go away.
Squidward	Is that supposed to be you?  I can't believe. He actually left.
Squidward	Whatever.
Squidward	Fine. Take a Krabby Patty and put it on the grill.
Squidward	Um... fine.
Squidward	Taught him everything he knows.
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	"My very own music class? Did you say ""Squilliam Fancyson""?"
Squidward	Oh.
Squidward	As I was saying, our first...
Squidward	Why don't  come write  name on the board? We'll see how  like it.
Squidward	"Squilliam, everybody, he was about to say ""Squilliam""!"
Squidward	You told me your resolution was to sign up for an all natural slimming, toning, and increased muscle mass program!
Squidward	You expect me to believe he was tickling himself?
Squidward	Alright, that's enough!
Squidward	Go on, you've already interrupted once. You might as well tell us what was so very important.
Squidward	What else did you buy at this convention? Your very own locomotive?
Squidward	This is what's known as a metronome.
Squidward	Do you mind?  Is there something seriously wrong with your HEADS?!
Squidward	Nope, they're just morons. Come on, you two, snap out of it!
Squidward	You wanna know what happened?
Squidward	No, no, no, no, no! Shh shh shh...
Squidward	Wha-What's going on here?
Squidward	Hey! What are you invertebrates doing?
Squidward	What are you doing here?! Well? Are you two trying to say something, or do I have to...?
Squidward	Enough! Listen up, Squidward's ghost is feeling unusually generous today. He hath decided to spare ye a a horrible fate. All ye must do is tend to my every whim and tickle my fancy on demand.
Squidward	No, too wet. Keep going. Keep going.
Squidward	Enough of that! I want something else to eat now. Something that's very difficult to find.
Squidward	I think I'm beginning to like this. Stop.  Now, play me an elaborate song with this!
Squidward	I'll take that!
Squidward	I don't want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done. Now, did you clean the back room yet?
Squidward	I didn't say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!
Squidward	SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?
Squidward	Do it!
Squidward	SpongeBob? Don't you know that its 7:00 in the morning?
Squidward	SpongeBob, nobody cares about...
Squidward	Wow.
Squidward	What?
Squidward	But being as you're the man in charge, you must have your reasons.
Squidward	So do it when you're done.
Squidward	He wants to be a fry cook, and you're his hero!
Squidward	Ha, ha! SpongeBob will believe anything!
Squidward	But your feet however are clean. Think about it. Your feet have been protected by your shoes and socks all day.
Squidward	What is this stuff?
Squidward	Mr. Krabs keeps this place a dump, so the food's more better by comparison!
Squidward	Mmm, you missed a spot.
Squidward	What did we talk about?
Squidward	It's official.  I hate everyone.  You imbeciles think that's entertainment? Brace yourself for true entertainment!
Squidward	Ready!
Squidward	Oh, I'm so happy for you!
Squidward	I believe this pile belongs to you.
Squidward	That story gets better every time you tell it, SpongeBo
Squidward	You mean the front door  the back door?
Squidward	You hired Patrick?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Are you getting any of this, SpongeBob?
Squidward	That's not the map, you old barnacle. those are  three moles and a birthmark.
Squidward	Stop breathing on my neck. Yuck.
Squidward	Those are just sock garters, you idiot.
Squidward	I was just  remembering the world before SpongeBob.
Squidward	Oh, give me that.  Snady, come in, Sandy.
Squidward	Yes.
Squidward	Ow!
Squidward	Oh, no. He's not going to sing.
Squidward	Grr!
Squidward	I can't understand a word you're saying.
Squidward	What's better about it? I liked it better before, when I could see!
Squidward	This is tic-tac-toe. You don't roll to see who goes first.
Squidward	One, two, three.
Squidward	Grrr!
Squidward	Cheating?! It's a jigsaw puzzle! You can't cheat!
Squidward	No way.
Squidward	Yes, Patrick?
Squidward	What?
Squidward	I'm the one who drew the line. You're not supposed to cross.
Squidward	That'll be the day.
Squidward	Whoa!
Squidward	Did you hear that?
Squidward	Woooo-hoooo! So long, suckers!
Squidward	Your order, ma'am.
Squidward	I do have a way with words.
Squidward	Pizazz. Hold on to your hats and glasses, people, because Squidward the Fantabulous has arrived.
Squidward	The only thing that can usually do that is something that causes more pain.
Squidward	I think he wants us to look at the O MY!
Squidward	How sophisticating!
Squidward	"Where is my ""Fab and Fancy?!"""
Squidward	Really?
Squidward	"Greetings. I'm Squidward Tentacles, your host of ""Squidward Chat"".   Today, on Squidward Chat, we'll be discussing something near and dear to my heart, under-appreciated artists like myself."
Squidward	This isn't happening!
Squidward	Patrick, SpongeBob, get off my camera!  Would you get out of here?
Squidward	Fine. You can be the soundman.
Squidward	Well, you'll just have to hold it, Patrick! Now, if there are no more interruptions...
Squidward	Cut that out!  That's it! Everyone, out!  What do you think this is, huh? Some kind of housewarming?!
Squidward	Keep it down! I'm trying to sleep!
Squidward	That is  stupidest dance move I've ever seen!
Squidward	That idiot has a dance audition? He doesn't know the first thing about the subtle intricacies of dance!  Let him practice till he drops! He's never gonna get that part.  That's it! He'll just have to practice 'til he drops! When he does, I'll be there all leotarded up and ready to show my stuff!  Oh, SpongeBob! SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob... ...duh, I mean, uh... ... I suppose I could take you under my tutelage, you know, show you a few moves.
Squidward	Oh, um, just a physical assessment I do with all of my new pupils.  Yeah, I'd say judging from the condition of those flabby ankles...
Squidward	What are you doing here?
Squidward	All right! You wanna learn some ?! I'll show you dancing!  You know what gets people going? Ribbons!
Squidward	You want to ace the audition, don't you?
Squidward	Remember, don't stop till you've done it right.
Squidward	Let's go, let's go! We're burning daylight.
Squidward	Only  best dancer in Bikini Bottom.
Squidward	Squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squidawa!
Squidward	Oh? And why is that?
Squidward	Neither did I.
Squidward	Please just get away from me.
Squidward	Can you just get the Krabby Patty?
Squidward	All right, I'll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?
Squidward	Mr. Krabs gives you that award so you'll work harder for no extra money.
Squidward	Need some help?  What are you doing?
Squidward	It's a symbol that you're a chump!
Squidward	SpongeBob? What are you doing here?
Squidward	Are you trying to say that you are better than me?!
Squidward	I don't need to sleep! Loser!
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	That oughta hold him!
Squidward	SpongeBob, I can't take it anymore. If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!
Squidward	...I'm gonna make a run for it.
Squidward	There's nothing to this patty flipping, Mr. Krabs! I'll easily double you output, Sponge-Hog!
Squidward	Medium.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, I hope whatever you're yelling about is something more important than my mid-morning nap!
Squidward	Don't you usually flush that stuff down the toilet?
Squidward	What do you think you're doing?
Squidward	Krabs is letting you go today?  As in I won't have to work with you ever again.
Squidward	Bugs... litter... litter... bugs
Squidward	Bikini Bottom P.D Ticket for littering. Penalty: Community service?!
Squidward	Daagh! Squilliam Fancyson! My arch foe from band class!
Squidward	Squilliam thinks he sooo amazing!  Phew!  Hmmm,I've gotta find some place to dump this litter.  Oh oh oh! Perfect!  Full! They're all full! How am I gonna hold all this...
Squidward	Why are you in a trash bag?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Alright! Fine! You can help me.
Squidward	Fine!  Now what?
Squidward	Know what? Don't care! The trash is gone. Thanks SpongeBob I hate you a little less now.
Squidward	SpongeBob. what's this?
Squidward	Of all the garbage that comes out of your mouth,this is the least annoying.
Squidward	They were gonna make a statue of me!
Squidward	Hhhhhha! Thanks SpongeBob!
Squidward	Yes.
Squidward	I hate them.
Squidward	Yes. Yes it was.
Squidward	Where's my trowl?
Squidward	Hmmm...
Squidward	He's a ghost, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	Good morning sir! Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
Squidward	No need! See? Not a drop!
Squidward	This!
Squidward	It specifically states that all employers must provide his or her employees with a secure, clean place to store personal property.
Squidward	Impressive indeed. Just keep your grubby little hands to your side.
Squidward	SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing? You're supposed to be fry cooking. I told you not to touch my stuff!
Squidward	What is that idiot doing now?!
Squidward	Well it's all fine and dandy, but where's my clarinet?
Squidward	Alright what do you want?
Squidward	SpongeBob?
Squidward	SpongeBob?!
Squidward	SpongeBob?! SpongeBob?!
Squidward	SpongeBob I do not play games.
Squidward	uuhh.. I'm.. trying to find my clarinet.
Squidward	I'm sorry I-I-I didn't mean to offend you.
Squidward	I got you now!
Squidward	What are talking about?
Squidward	-Such a nightmare!
Squidward	Grrr...
Squidward	Yes, yes I am; as a matter of fact, you wouldn't believe what I had to go through to get-
Squidward	Well, I'm going to go soak my tentacles.  It's cold in here underneath all of this concrete!
Squidward	Eugene, what is Zed-9er9er!!?? And more importantly, how does it affect me!?
Squidward	And what?
Squidward	I've come for your pickle!
Squidward	I don't get it.
Squidward	SpongeBob, will you stop crying?!
Squidward	Yes!
Squidward	It's a quick montage of flashbacks I've edited together that shows the hundreds of tears you have cried over the years.
Squidward	Um, nothing, I just threw up a little in my mouth.  No need to worry, Squiddy. You've outdone yourself. He'll be crying in ten minutes.
Squidward	Really tugs the heartstrings, doesn't it?
Squidward	That is just so adorable. Almost makes you want to cry.
Squidward	"""Dear SpongeBob, we are having a wonderful time in the South Seas and we miss you very, very much."
Squidward	Fine!
Squidward	Don't be long. My secret weapon is waiting.
Squidward	Uh, SpongeBob. No-no-no-no, wait.
Squidward	"Oh, very sad. Umm... ""There once was a little angler  who was, uh, little and sad.  One day the little sad angler was walking through the park."
Squidward	No, no. No, no. Please.
Squidward	WHOOPEE! Ha ha ha! Whoopee! Woo-
Squidward	I'm holding a package from famous producer Buddy Barracuda. I sent him my play and now, he's gonna produce it!
Squidward	Let's see here. Ahem. Oh, yeah.
Squidward	Well, I suppose that could work. If people see my play, they'll recognize my genius! And I'll become famous and-
Squidward	But SpongeBob, there's no singing in my-
Squidward	And we let him handle our food?
Squidward	Dim the house lights.
Squidward	Onto this world, an octopus was born. A cephalopod with promise and potential.
Squidward	He had promise until he came to work here, at the Krusty Krab. Serving local morons heart-stopping, artery-clogging garbage, masquerading as food.
Squidward	Sigh...Yes, you can.
Squidward	It would appear not. No ketchup! That's terrible! Here, let me help you with that.
Squidward	Umm, Mr. Krabs, I'm acting.
Squidward	Doh! Just stand there and act like...yourself!
Squidward	His genius was unrecognized.
Squidward	Unfulfilled. In a word, his myriad of talents were, wasted.
Squidward	Here! Enjoy!
Squidward	Oh boy.
Squidward	Just dont panic!
Squidward	: Your what?
Squidward	I live here.  And what's so funny?
Squidward	He likes me. Officer, arrest me right now, because I am about to throw a horrible tantrum that no one around here wants to see.
Squidward	Yuck. You actually care for that thing?
Squidward	As in, not here for three days?
Squidward	Sure it's enough?
Squidward	Right, yeah, right.  Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! So long, losers!  They're gone!
Squidward	Hi, SpongeBob.
Squidward	Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there.
Squidward	Will you hold him still?
Squidward	I'm telling you, its all in your head.
Squidward	Trust me SpongeBob, nothing's going to happen to you. You're fine.
Squidward	None of this would be happening if I'd only fed the snail!
Squidward	Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow  .
Squidward	AAAAAAHHH!!!! She's gone! My clarinet has gone missing!
Squidward	I'm missing my clarinet.
Squidward	Ohh no!!
Squidward	Would you shut it already?!
Squidward	Hello, miserable life, I'm back.
Squidward	I told you...we're closed! I was supposed to get out of here ten minutes ago! And besides, I already cashed the register out.
Squidward	No way.
Squidward	Nope.
Squidward	You're asking the wrong guy about curses, I live next to SpongeBob
Squidward	I just remember there is a no-curse clause in my contract, nice working with you.
Squidward	No! I do not want a Krabby Patty!
Squidward	Another miserable day...
Squidward	SpongeBob, why are you doing this?
Squidward	This is your fault!
Squidward	Don't jump in a coral pit.
Squidward	That'll will be 3 dollars.
Squidward	No, you're not. You're leaving your grummy finger prints all over the glass! And now yours truly is gonna have to clean it up! Why does everyone insist on making my job so difficult?!  You always leave trash on the table!  Your teeth chatter!  Your hat annoys me!  You take too long in the restroom!  And SpongeBob, would you quit singing that song?
Squidward	Oh, boy. Morons.
Squidward	For the last time, we're out of patties.  No need to get excited now.
Squidward	Well, pick one, and leave my yard out of it!
Squidward	I thought I told you two to stay off my...  yard.  Patrick!  Patrick, would you shut...?  Where is he?  SpongeBob.  SpongeBob!  SpongeBob, I am trying to...  sleep?    Hey, Gary.
Squidward	I knew you two reprobates were behind this.
Squidward	But you buried my house!
Squidward	"Now, you're gonna play a new game called, ""Digging Out my House!"""
Squidward	I'm warning you: If you don't put my house back where it belongs by the count of th-ree-  Three. I am going to grind you into Chum! One!
Squidward	You... two... morons... SUNK MY HOUSE!
Squidward	What's this? Hhmmm... haven't seen this before.
Squidward	Garbage. That'll be a $5 contribution fee.
Squidward	Next.
Squidward	Uh-huh.  Interesting.  This is a promising sign. Yep.  You hear that plate-hitting-skull sound? It's definitely authentic. And I would price it conservatively in today's market at $250.
Squidward	Sorry, Patrick, but there's no way I'm letting you put your dumb rock in the time capsule. I've allowed some seriously ridiculous items today, but this is where I draw the line. Do you unders...?
Squidward	That's it, this game is
Squidward	Dig me out when my life doesn't stink.
Squidward	Grrr!
Squidward	No, no, no!  Alright, I am trying to have a relaxing evening. What are you two doing?
Squidward	All I want to do is live in a world where I can just relax in peace  and quiet.  Is that too much to ask?
Squidward	I can't take it anymore!
Squidward	Next stop, padded room at the cephalopod home!  Just go with it, Squiddy.
Squidward	Hit it boys!
Squidward	My world!
Squidward	I know how to make it last!
Squidward	No, I'm not ready to go!
Squidward	No!
Squidward	No!
Squidward	No!  No!  What?!
Squidward	Out! Sheesh! Shouldn't you be at work today, SpongeBob?!
Squidward	I'll be out of here in no time.
Squidward	Uh, the future...  Huh?! O-okay, uh, what's going on here? Why is everything... chrome?
Squidward	Future! Future! Future! Future!  Thanks. Now listen! All of you! I don't belong here. This is all a horrible mistake! Please, we've got to do something!
Squidward	What are you simpletons doing?! You're supposed to catch these things, not torture yourself with them!  Give me those loincloths!  I can't believe it.  This oughta make things go a little smoother!  Give me those things! You're supposed to catch them, like this!  It's called jellyfishing.  Ah, finally.  Arrgh! Get me outta here!  Uh-oh.
Squidward	Oh, I'm back! I can't believe this. I-I-I was in space, a-and I went to the future, and-and then I went to the past, and-and then-then I was nowhere, but now I'm back, and-and... you don't know how happy I am to see you guys.
Squidward	Oh fun. I suppose you want me to play some stupid game, or you'll just follow me around all day and never ever leave, huh?
Squidward	Would you quit it with that tune already?
Squidward	Figures you would be into that hideous pop fodder.
Squidward	FREEDOM!
Squidward	It's called a clarinet.
Squidward	Oh, yeah. That's catchy stuff, Squiddy. Catchy stuff. Mmm-hmm.
Squidward	WHAT?!
Squidward	I knew it!
Squidward	For the love of all things briny, it's me!
Squidward	Are you suggesting the Krabby Patties are art?
Squidward	Yes, tomtomorrow!
Squidward	Fine. The first thing I need you to do, assistant, is get me a giant stone so that I may sculpt this masterpiece.
Squidward	Prepare to be immortalized in stone.
Squidward	Nope.
Squidward	Mm. (gets an idea) Hold that pose! Don't move a muscle. (chuckles)
Squidward	Make sure you wear sunglasses, or you may be blinded by my genius.
Squidward	It represents the gaping, mashing maw of consumerism and the endless cavern it creates within us all. I call it Oppression.
Squidward	What, you wanted a piece or art and that's what you got.
Squidward	And this affects me, how?
Squidward	So, these things went crazy just because they had the sniffles?
Squidward	Didn't think so. What are you barnacle heads doing, anyway?
Squidward	Well, you two have fun with your mutual ignominious society.
Squidward	The suspense is killing me!
Squidward	Excruciating...
Squidward	I don't know. That's a pretty long talk.
Squidward	SpongeBob, my boy, I realized long ago that there is nothing, I repeat, nothing, that could make this job any more boring, or humiliating, or demeaning, that it already is.
Squidward	Help! I'm having horrible abdominal pain! I think it was the the  Line.
Squidward	Like something that would make Mr. Krabs' wiener thing blow right up in his face!
Squidward	SpongeBob... SpongeBob... SpongeBob... SpongeBob! What are you doing? I've been saying I needed a Krabby Patty about a bajillion times! And you w What the...? Ha, ha, ha! Nice patty, Michelangelo! Ha!  I hope you're not expecting an award anytime soon. Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Squidward	Well, I guess that explains this.
Squidward	Three patties, four large oyster skins, on the double, SpongeBob!
Squidward	SpongeBob! Now are you gonna...
Squidward	I hate all of you.
Squidward	No.  As I was saying, you two...
Squidward	For rent? You mean one of you is moving out?
Squidward	Oh I would love to. Just let me check my planner.
Squidward	With those two bone bags gone, I now have enough time for some peace and...  ...quiet.  Now what are those two boobs up to? I thought you guys were...  Hmmm. I wonder who was making all that noise.
Squidward	Aren't we all?
Squidward	I can't believe what I am hearing.  Finally, a neighbor that has it! I can only imagine! Painting portraits while sipping tea, recumbent bicycling into a museum, and performing a duet at the Bikini Bottom concert!
Squidward	To a new neighbor!
Squidward	Well, that's nice.
Squidward	Nope, nobody's out there!
Squidward	No! You REALLY don't wanna go out there, trust me!
Squidward	Phew! That was close.
Squidward	Excuse me one more time!
Squidward	Oh, Neptune nooooo!
Squidward	Well, Squiddy, what have I got to lose?  Hey, come back here you bubble!  JELLYFISHING BUBBLE BLOWERS!
Squidward	"That's no ""ook"". That's just a cruel reminder that I'm single, and will likely be that way forever."
Squidward	Who-who is that? She's got da-da-da-da-da...  She's, wow!
Squidward	My next move exactly! Observe the old tentacles and all of its glory!
Squidward	She's leaving!
Squidward	What do you mean?
Squidward	Sometime today would be nice.
Squidward	What! Oh! Um. Did you drop your lip balm!
Squidward	Oh, where are my manners!?  Alrightie.  Can I help you with that?
Squidward	Good.
Squidward	Alright.
Squidward	Um. Can you believe all this weather we're having?
Squidward	SpongeBob! Would you please just shut it and leave me alone?
Squidward	Um, you just saw that.
Squidward	SpongeBob, I'm dreamy!
Squidward	Oh dear Neptune didn't you hear me-
Squidward	Oh I mean it alright. She's a big buffoon, just like Patrick. Except bigger, and dumber, and bufoonier.
Squidward	Hey you can't do that, that's my window!
Squidward	But that's from...  my house! That's it! I've had my fill of this thieving brute!
Squidward	Oh, you mean like this?  Sweeeet destruction!
Squidward	Mr. Krabs! There's a strange sound coming from the restroom!
Squidward	Oh, well. Thank you for ask-
Squidward	Really? Well, maybe I should give them a call.
Squidward	Hmm? Anything?
Squidward	"I said, ""fluff it."""
Squidward	After tea, I'd like a tentacle massage.
Squidward	Oh, it's gonna be a long full recovery. Time to pop my back barnacles.
Squidward	Thats when I entered the back room get a new bun, and just when I was about to reach one, I heard a slight creek. The chained snapped, and then, wham! I I lay on the floor for nearly six hours crying softly for help.  Help! H-help! Help.  But the worst part was that I didn't get that kind gentleman his new bun.
Squidward	Oh, no!
Squidward	Time to get out the dental floss. Ha.
Squidward	Coming right up, sir. SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty, with extra fries and a medium drink.
Squidward	Oh, wonderful. Peachy. Now how am I suppose to get two SpongeBobs so I can hand them these order tickets here?
Squidward	With fries. Got it. We'll have it right out to you sir.
Squidward	Welcome to the Krusty Krab Drive Thru. Can I take your order?
Squidward	How much?
Squidward	No but that pile of tin cans over there is .
Squidward	SpongeBob! Order up!
Squidward	And these ones don't!
Squidward	If you two don't mind, could you keep it down to a low rumble?
Squidward	I will not indulge in anything friendly or otherwise with the likes of you two! Presently, I am heading to enjoy a well-deserved morning nap!
Squidward	Would you two KEEP IT DOWN?!
Squidward	SpongeBob?!
Squidward	OK, this is getting creepy now.
Squidward	Open the door, nitwit!
Squidward	Touching. Still creepy, but touching. Time to make a phone call.
Squidward	Thank you again, officers.
Squidward	My house?!
Squidward	Well, maybe you can take photos of all your junk... uh, friends before you toss them away.
Squidward	Well, now that you completely ruined my day, once again, I'm going back to bed.
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	No way.
Squidward	Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Squidward	No. We are not having a slumber party!
Squidward	Those dimwits don't stand a chance against my imported worm.  Hey! What's the big idea?!
Squidward	Alright, alright! Someone get me a blanket.
Squidward	Aaah. What? You're burning the sleigh? Are you aware that's our mode of transportation?
Squidward	Would you two mind stopping with your baby games!? Didn't anybody tell you it's the break of dawn!?
Squidward	Show you?
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Okay.
Squidward	To go along with your new beard which makes you look very distinguished!
Squidward	Well played Patrick! Well played...
Squidward	And my personal favorite piece is  this lovely statue from the Reef-aissance Era-
Squidward	Patrick Star, I am very proud of what you did in there! You know that beard is the best thing that has ever happened to you! Well, other than me of course. Heh...
Squidward	Look Mr. BabyPants  it's gladly clear you learned nothing today on how to be mature!
Squidward	We are about to enter the pinnacle of grown-up culture here in Bikini Bottom! Also known as: The Famed Bikini Bottom Opera House!
Squidward	Oh! Oh! It gets even more thrilling from here!
Squidward	Quiet! Hold it! Stop it right there! I am ashamed and disgusted by you people! I mean don't you know what terrible performance when you see it!?
Squidward	You know, SpongeBob, statistics show that public speaking is the number three cause of stress right behind death and marriage. NOW GET THOSE ORDERS READY!
Squidward	You wouldn't know what real music is if it came up and hit you in the face.
Squidward	None of you simpletons would recognize real musical talent if it came up and kicked you in the face!
Squidward	Oh, really?
Squidward	Shameless. You again?
Squidward	Not again.
Squidward	Huh, huh? How are you enjoying the music so far?
Squidward	Want to... sing?
Squidward	Thank you, thank you.
Squidward	That's an understatement.
Squidward	Oh, don't you see, Sheldon? Thanks to you, I'm getting better and better as a musician.
Squidward	Hey!  Come back!
Squidward	Don't touch it! And it's not a hat. It's a beret.
Squidward	So, you've been counterfeiting currency? And what's doorknob number two been up to?
Squidward	"Oh, it certainly is! This piece represents my struggle to reveal my genius to a moronic world.  Witness ""La Vista Squidward""! Stunning, isn't it?"
Squidward	Hey!
Squidward	Well, about...Um, um, well, I'll bet he never sells another one of those ridiculous trinkets!
Squidward	I actually want to go to work today!
Squidward	Then, what do you want?
Squidward	Huh? What?
Squidward	Mm-hmm!
Squidward	"""Dear Squidward, come to my house tonight I am having a...  ...latte sipping contest?"" This sound too good to be true!"
Squidward	Hallelujah!
Squidward	What makes you think I have any interest in your delusional adventurism?
Squidward	Nooooooooooooooooooo!
Squidward	Welcome to my world.
Squidward	Go away! I've got better things to do than watch grown men prance around in ridiculous outfits.  ...what? Circuit must've blown again.
Squidward	Oh, no. No way! Look what that disgusting pest did to my sustainable kelp garden!  He chewed it up, ruined it!
Squidward	Oh, how could this be? Whatever shall I do?
Squidward	Oh, the dream is still alive!
Squidward	Me? No. Of course not. No.
Squidward	That's it. Hang on, SpongeBob. I need a rest. My throat is parched. I sure wish I knew where one could procure some lemonade.
Squidward	Oh, no. Dear me. Oh, no. I could not have you wait in that long line, SpongeBob.
Squidward	"Ah, ""Turquoise Scallop Sun Dance."" I just love this tune."
Squidward	What the? What?
Squidward	Such immaculate music. It's the very voice of Neptune himself.
Squidward	Oh, no, you don't, Patrick. You stay away from my backstage pa huh?
Squidward	But our friend just took our
Squidward	We're in, SpongeBob. Now I'll finally get to meet the incomparable Kelpy G.
Squidward	"But, but, but what if I told you, uh I'm a clarinet player myself.  I call this one, ""Ninth Movement, A Kaleidoscope of Stars."" Wait. Hold for it."
Squidward	20 years of paint-staking care, and my bonsai portrait is almost complete. Oh! Oh, my. What's this?  I missed a spot. Not to worry. You'll be perfect soon, as perfect as me. Hmm...   Oh. Look what I've done.  Oh, no!
Squidward	"""Avenge me?""  SpongeBob!"
Squidward	Come on, SpongeBob! What's wrong with you!? Get grilling!
Squidward	More Patties!
Squidward	Where is he?
Squidward	Of course.
Squidward	What the...?  SpongeBob, do you mind!?
Squidward	Go away.
Squidward	Okay. And would you like cheese on--
Squidward	Oh, really? And do you think that I don't know that this grill is...
Squidward	Perhaps my lawyers should explain
Squidward	I thought not  Oh-kay Patrick. WHAT? WHAT?! WHAT!
Squidward	What?
Squidward	No! NO! NO! NO! GRR!  Go away Patrick! Go away Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!  Patrick!   Patrick!  Patrick!  Patrick!  Patrick!
Squidward	Ooh...that's great...
Squidward	Welcome to the House of Misery. May I take your order...
Squidward	Seaberries? I'm allergic to... Seaberries...That's it! I know what I must do!  SpongeBob!
Squidward	Give me that restraining order!
Squidward	Stop the waterworks! You're not going to jail.
Squidward	No, Patrick! YOU!!
Squidward	Shocking.
Squidward	Yes, your freakishness.
Squidward	No, no, no, you don't get it! It's the work of Fiasco the artist!  He was featured in last month's Art Wonk magazine!
Squidward	Oh, it's simply not for sale, not even for a million dollars.
Squidward	Here they are, Officers! These idiots have been causing a ruckus. Interrupting my beauty sleep.
Squidward	One Krabby Patty, extra grease.
Squidward	All right, let me see it.  The Krusty Krab work schedule, what's so great about this?
Squidward	Yes?!
Squidward	Look, I don't need a happy memory, so just get back to your culinary grease factory and leave me alone.
Squidward	Well, it's against my better judgement, but, okay.
Squidward	This is not my happiest memory...
Squidward	Gosh! I can't believe it! I think this might be it!
Squidward	And now he's melted it... Not a happiest memory...
Squidward	Wait! No!  Oh boy...  Oh yeah...nice view...
Squidward	I just can't seem to get happy...  Well, that didn't help...  Huh? That's strange, I could have swear I just threw that darn phone away.  Oh yeah. My fax machine. Now, why did I buy that again?
Squidward	"""Tentacles"". Yes that's me."
Squidward	I feel WONDERFUL!  This is it, my happiest memory!
Squidward	It's The Big One! It's the end of the world! Invest in gold! Hoard your drinking wa... I should've known.  What's going on in here?!
Squidward	Against my will, I might add.
Squidward	My order?
Squidward	Oh, well I wouldn't do to have my face in a toilet right now.
Squidward	: Would You Mind?!
Squidward	Whatever works.
Squidward	: You deliver it, I'm on break.
Squidward	HEY, IT'S NOT FUNNY! STOP LAUGHING!
Squidward	Now what?
Squidward	...garbage.
Squidward	Yes! For the final time, I don't want that paper. It's yours forever and ever!
Squidward	Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg, and plead, and cry, don't give that paper back to me...ever!
Squidward	Super-moron's more like it.
Squidward	Hey, that little paper does seem like fun.  What am I saying?! I am such an idiot.  SpongeBob, honestly, and his dumb paper. He calls that fun?  Now, reading 'Boring Science Digest,' that's fun.  Erosion.  Mitosis.  See, I can have fun taking a bath.  Painting fruit, there's nothing more fun than painting fruit. This is more fun than anything.  I'll prove to him that paper is not fun!  I'm having fun, la-la-la...
Squidward	Haha, I'm having so much fun with my new shell-cart. Ah-haha. Hey, SpongeBob, can your stupid paper do this?
Squidward	Give me my paper back! Now let go of it. I said let go of it!  Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go...
Squidward	Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg and plead and cry, don't give that paper back to me ever!
Squidward	Not the lint, the rubber band!
Squidward	Trade...
Squidward	You can have all that junk, 'cause now I've got this! I've got the paper, and you've got my useless garbage.  I got it! Haha and you can't have it.  I got it, you're a sucker. You're a sucker, sucker!  At last, what should we try first, Mr. Paper? Impressions! A guy with a piece of paper on his nose.  Look at me! I'm a guy with a piece of paper...on his...nose. Hmmm. A-ha! Wait, wait, wait, wait...  Tada!
Squidward	My, what a beautiful day it is outside.  Too bad I'm cooped up here in the Krusty Krab.
Squidward	"Sick? Is that really a ""worse""?"
Squidward	Uh, well. Let's see. Uh. I got a scratchy throat and, uh,  dry mouth, and my, uh, eyes are itchy.
Squidward	Squid's disease.
Squidward	Well, SpongeBob. I think you're probably right.
Squidward	Ow!
Squidward	But I...
Squidward	SpongeBob, would you bring that order to table 3, please.
Squidward	Not that. The thing on your face.
Squidward	Could I see that?
Squidward	And you're telling me this, why?
Squidward	Who thought that having an illness could feel so good?
Squidward	SpongeBob, what have I told you about coming into my house?
Squidward	Please just stop. Stop following me.
Squidward	Here, I'll change the channel.
Squidward	I'm not home!
Squidward	I beg to differ.I mean, justlook at this place!  It's disgusting, not to mention our cheap boss!
Squidward	One at a time, please.
Squidward	I don't care if it isn't finished! Just take the orders!
Squidward	Ow! I didn't do it! Uh, uh, it was him!
Squidward	Ow!
Squidward	Don't know, don't care.
Squidward	Will we got overtime pay?
Squidward	Oh yeah, I'm definitelygonna do this.
Squidward	Ah-he-he-hem.
Squidward	And who might you be?
Squidward	Uh, excuse me? Is there anyway I get to do this tour as a soloist?
Squidward	We're performing at a supermarket!? Driver, turn this bus around! The tour is canceled! Head straight back to the Krusty Krab!
Squidward	A one! And a two! And a one, two, three, four!  Thank you! Thank you very much!  Oh come on! Nothing!?
Squidward	Two, three, four!  Two, three, four!
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, how much farther is it to the next town?
Squidward	Hold it! This better not be one of your tricks Mr. Krabs!
Squidward	Wait! I know what you came here for!  Well?
Squidward	Well, that wasn't a complete waste of time...Oh no wait, it was...
Squidward	Mr. Krabs, I'd like some money for cab fair.
Squidward	I could care less what the Krusty Krab needs!  Now get out of my way!  Ow! Ow! OOOOWWWW!!! Ow...
Squidward	How did I not see this plan was a failure from the start? Being around SpongeBob is bad for my heart! And that's not even the worse part! Supermarkets, retirement homes, birthday parties for kids! My career in music really feels like it has hit the skids! I give up! There is no point! I give up! Mr. Krabs will have to go bankrupt while I'm busy, bittering giving up!
Squidward	Wow! That was actually, kinda good!
Squidward	Where?
Squidward	Question. Are you two acting more infantile than normal?
Squidward	Of course I'm grown up! Why wouldn't I be?!  Am I wearing a diaper?
Squidward	Ahhh, yes, just how I like it......nice and empty.
Squidward	Hmm, what was that imbecile doing in there?  An old book?
Squidward	Why did I say that?
Squidward	What are you screaming about!?
Squidward	Oh no! Oh no! Oh no no no no no no!  Yes! Oh, my prized spiny succulent! Thank Neptune you're safe!
Squidward	What kind of unforeseen yet completely predictable stupidity have you ruined my day with this time?
Squidward	I won't. Uh... hello? Is somebody there? Um... hello? It's considered rude not to answer! Hah... whatta ya got? Cotton in your earholes? I gotta get outta here!SPONGEBOB!
Squidward	You were rrrright!
Squidward	You gotta teach me SpongeBob! Teach me the way! The way of tarake.
Squidward	"Sigh... I mean can't get just get on with this ""O Great Sensei?"""
Squidward	Oh boy...
Squidward	Oh...whatever. Hiyah...
Squidward	Sigh...whatever you say Sensei...
Squidward	Dimwits luck!
Squidward	Sandy! Wait! I need you to teach... Sigh... this is pointless. I'll never be able to protect myself. I may as well start handing my groceries to criminals. Here! Please Mr. Criminal! Take my unprocessed kelp feed!
Squidward	Shut up! Phew!
Squidward	Okay! Okay! Hee-YAH!Hah hah hah! Oh, I did it! Hee-YAH! I can protect my groceries now! Hee-YAH! I am a karate master! WOO HOO HOO!
Squidward	Hah! Hah! How do you like them apples? YAH!
Squidward	Uh, oh.
Squidward	And what is that suppose to mean?
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	Ah, a beautiful day beachside. I couldn't think of a thing that could ruin this.
Squidward	You idiots!  That goo is dangerous! Weren't you two morons listening?
Squidward	Sheesh, you'd think the sky was falling.  I am going to learn to keep my big mouth shut.
Squidward	Ha! You two won't sleep a wink tonight if you see that movie.
Squidward	Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. SpongeBob! Get up! He's here!
Squidward	How cheesy. Who would ever be frightened by that?
Squidward	Charming colloquialism, but let's try something that's actually on the menu.
Squidward	What is your problem?
Squidward	SpongeBob's got that covered.
Squidward	Oh, a restaurant employee handling chewed bubble gum? That's gotta violate a lot of health codes.
Squidward	Ludicrous.
Squidward	Oh, come on, SpongeBob. Krabs' Yeti story is a complete and total crock!
Squidward	Of course, he is. Nice costume, Eugene. Couldn't you at least have it dry-cleaned or pressed?  Didn't brush this morning. Did we?
Squidward	Oh, I hope you're happy, Mr. Krabs! You're driving him insane!  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll eat me if I'm lazy. Whatever.  Not the home and garden section! SpongeBob!
Squidward	Guess I'm down to the comic section.
Squidward	Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm a little busy trying to pull off this stupid mask of yours.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
Squidward	Hey, what about me? Can I get fired too?
Squidward	I can smell the grease fires already.
Squidward	You know I hate you, right?
Squidward	20 minutes in the bath seems like enough.   Another day!  Another day.
Squidward	Yes, I saw that.
Squidward	A straight line is the shortest distance between any two points!
Squidward	What moron told you that?
Squidward	No, SpongeBob. I'm just going to struggle through the rest of this walk, alone.
Squidward	No thanks, I got one!  Perfect. No customers. No SpongeBob.
Squidward	Congratulations.
Squidward	I couldn't find a smelling salt, so I just used table salt.
Squidward	Let me grab a pencil.  Ha, it's funny, cause I mean the opposite. Ha.
Squidward	You missed one.
Squidward	Fourteen!
Squidward	No no no no no! Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Don't tell me anything, don't even tell me what you're doing here!
Squidward	I know.
Squidward	"""You are cordially invited to the fanciest and shmansiest artistic event of the season: The opening of Galleria Diphtheria."" Oh, I've heard of that! ""Bikini Bottom's most exclusive fine arts showcase. This invitation guarantees the admittance of Squidward Tentacles--"" ""--Squidward Tentacles...""""...'Ploos Oh-nay.'"""
Squidward	Do you have to do it?
Squidward	Let's see here. Friends...
Squidward	But, of course! It's so simple.
Squidward	Hey, there you are!
Squidward	Say, I bet we have a lot in common.
Squidward	Once you've had pointed toast, you just never want any other kind.
Squidward	Oh, you think you know a guy?  Oh, who are you kidding? It's not in the cards for you. I bet not even this old tin can would be my friend.
Squidward	I need to ask you something important.
Squidward	You have?
Squidward	We make quite a team!
Squidward	Whatever. The point is do you want to go with me to a gallery opening tonight?
Squidward	I mean...
Squidward	What are you doing here?
Squidward	Thanks.
Squidward	Come on, SpongeBob.
Squidward	: Ah, the executive treatment.
Squidward	:  First of all a lot of that donut, it's still on your face!
Squidward	: Well, you're half right.
Squidward	:  I'll save it alright. I'll just put it here in the circular files.
Squidward	Yeah. Probably my eye.
Squidward	This is the greatest company picnic ever?
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Don't!
Squidward	One side, Goopy!
Squidward	I have to say, Mr. Plankton. If this is how you treat your employees...
Squidward	Grr!  Excuse me, sir. But you seem to be having trouble masticating. Here let me help you.  What? No tip? Finally! Yes!  Leaving early! I can't believe this is finally happening!  Cause it's not.
Squidward	What are we all winking about?
Squidward	I can't do that!
Squidward	What the?  Oh, it's not a cold, it's my allergies.
Squidward	What happened to you? And where did all these snails come from?!
Squidward	Enough! You have to get rid of those snails and get back to work!
Squidward	Oh, chill your gills! I'll get your food, dude!
Squidward	"He said, ""No, thank you, please""? What does that even mean? I demand that you do something about those snails, now!"
Squidward	A little higher. A little to the left. A little more to the left. Ha- Perfect!  Oww.
Squidward	Wonder no longer, you only need one.
Squidward	Oh, let me think. That sounds so no!
Squidward	Yeah. Somebody thinks up the game, then they make the game.
Squidward	Double morons.
Squidward	I know I'm gonna hate myself for saying this, but what have you got?
Squidward	Tic and Tac.
Squidward	Well, if it's started, then I'm already bored.
Squidward	Are we finished? Who won?
Squidward	Look, Patrick! You go, then Sandy, then SpongeBob, then me! Okay?
Squidward	Could you give me the dice? Give me the dice? Because it's my turn!
Squidward	Well, what do I do to get out of jail?
Squidward	What? Wait! No! But I don't have a finbone! I'm an octopus!
Squidward	That's it! I've had enough!
Squidward	Race the car!
Squidward	Could someone please tell me what we are supposed to be doing? What's the point? This entire game is completely random! It jumps from one thing to another! I don't know how you are supposed to win! And Patrick seems to be making up the rules as he goes along!
Squidward	Ha.
Squidward	You did it again. You made up another rule! This game is the worst! Stupid game!
Squidward	Oh, Teddy. You're my favorite snuggle buddy.
Squidward	Why don't you clean your own... uh...
Squidward	Ah, but did you clean down to the subatomic particles?
Squidward	Ahh!! What have I done?!
Squidward	Here they go!
Squidward	I didn't say the safe!
Squidward	Alright! As soon as I get the frycook out of the toilet, you can all have your krabby patties!
Squidward	Do not touch me! I am way out of my comfort zone!
Squidward	Look like snakes.
Squidward	Darn it! I missed again!
Squidward	Where? Where?
Squidward	In here!
Squidward	Oh. That makes sense.
Squidward	I'm alive? I'm alive!
Squidward	But Mr. Krabs? Why?
Squidward	What?!
Squidward	Nobody does, it's art, now sit down!
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	Well, that was the last customer, SpongeBob.
Squidward	One free ice cream, please?
Squidward	For the love of Pete!
Squidward	What is going on?
Squidward	Come on! Get in my mouth! No, this one's empty!
Squidward	Uh, let me give you a hand. My thumbs work.
Squidward	A dance troupe, you numb-skull! This is a dance showdown. No one is going to fight!
Squidward	What rec center.
Squidward	"I said ""Whatever.""  Wait, didn't I just... Didn't I...[]"
Squidward	If this is a dream. there are no consequences. I can do anything! [] I really am dreaming! []
Squidward	That's right. [] I don't care (x2) none of this is real. Hmm, I always wanted to fly and since this is my dream, I'm going to fly! []
Squidward	Good morning, SpongeBob!  Oh,  why I felt great this morning, there was no SpongeBob.
Squidward	Oh, why didn't you just use the money that Nick Fishkins gave you to rent a room or buy a new home?
Squidward	Ah, work is done!  Now I can go home to a SpongeBob-free zone and rearrange my doily collection!
Squidward	Oh, like, pfft, 12 kids!
Squidward	Um, yes.
Squidward	Say what?
Squidward	Ach, meine Neptune, uh, now is nein such a good time mit the wife and zuch!
Squidward	I don't know...Hedvig!  Dunt movin! Not a schtepp!  Nein, nein! No moven sie! Sitz!  Hey, man, like, what's happening?
Squidward	Sure there is.
Squidward	One--  One second!  Tonight's zupper is to go, so please, to go!
Squidward	Ve are der little kiddievinks, der kiddievinks, der kiddievinks, ve are der little kiddievinks, ve love to sing all day!
Squidward	He doesn't live in the houses he buys.
Squidward	What happened?
Squidward	I...I can't believe you did that!
Squidward	I caught sight of the calendar.
Squidward	Well, it's been nice working here.  Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	Well, as long as it's not me.
Squidward	April Fools!
Squidward	Wait, wait, it was a joke! Uh huh...  Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach.  Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo-  gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought.   SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob?  Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of This isn't something I normally do so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I am...  Patrick? What are you doing here?
Squidward	With what?
Squidward	I'm trying to say I'm  hee-haw-hee-haw!
Squidward	I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear!
Squidward	What the...? Yes, whatever! But you have to promise not to tell anybody.
Squidward	Because, SpongeBob, fortune cookie fortunes are always lame and they never come true
Squidward	Holy harpoons, the fortune did come true!
Squidward	My tentacles are going to fall off if I don't get a break soon, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward	"What? No, you don't fire meI quit! I got my resignation letter all prepared.  ""Dear Mr. Krabs"""
Squidward	I was. They turned out to be nightmares. Apparently, you need more than 17 years behind a cash register to be qualified for dreams.  I never thought I would say this, but I'm begging you, SpongeBob, let me come back and work at the Krusty Krab Museum.
Squidward	They taste like lice!
Squidward	Shouldn't we chase after him? He didn't pay.
Squidward	It was SpongeBob's idea. Him and Patrick are behind this. They forced me to help.
Squidward	Oh, he responded hours ago.
Squidward	"Huh?  ""Squidward Tentacles should never be allowed behind a cash register."" P-Star7? Oh, that is it! Why can't any of these yocals understand I'm working here? Ironically!"
Squidward	I AM NOT ANSWERING TO DELICATE FLOWER!
Squidward	Another monotonous day I spend walking in slow motion towards an empty horizon?
Squidward	If I do, will you promise to stop?
Squidward	I did it exactly the way you did it!
Squidward	Whoopee.
Squidward	What the?
Squidward	Oh! It's like eating the inside of a lawn mower!
Squidward	Uh, shouldn't we clear the docks? Or batten down the patches? Or whatever people say?
Squidward	Sorry. I don't think that's the captain's job. You're on your own.
Squidward	Oh, barnacles!
Squidward	Are you crazy? I can't fight a monster!
Squidward	Ha! You rube. There's no such thing as a Tooth Fairy.
Squidward	There is no baloney! Just like there is no Tooth Fairy. In fact, if you could prove there were a Tooth Fairy, I would eat, oh, a bucket of chum!
Squidward	Ha! I was right! The Tooth Fairy isn't real!
Squidward	Hey, come on! This is just a big misunderstanding! Ferry, fairy: They're two different words that just happen to sound alike!
Squidward	Stop serenading me, you sap! It's my day off! Now, go away!
Squidward	What? I thought I had my house sponge and star proofed!
Squidward	Loathing SpongeBob. Scorning Patrick. La, la, la, la, la, la.
Squidward	What the? How did...
Squidward	Uh, that's okay. I don't need to hear. Uh...
Squidward	So you read comics. Don't worry. Lots of perfectly immature adults read comics.
Squidward	And cower in fear of Doctor Negative.
Squidward	No, Mr. Bob. I expect you to fry!
Squidward	"""I'll be in me office polishing yesterday's booty."""
Squidward	Oh, boy, that was a close one.
Squidward	Oh, that's it! I can't stand the perfect impression of me anymore! I never thought I'd say this, but I'm tired of looking at myself. I quit!
Squidward	On it, sir! Hasta la vista, worm boy!
Squidward	Oh, why can't I get to sleep? Let's try it again.  Warm milk.  White noise machine.
Squidward	Horrible! I haven't slept for three days!
Squidward	Taking a walk... walk... walk.
Squidward	Must... gain... control!
Squidward	Oh, I am going to lambaste you two!
Squidward	I cannot believe I let you talk me into this.
Squidward	Okay, I'm going in.
Squidward	I've been infected!
Squidward	Hey, what are you
Squidward	Who wants food? I'm a mindless drone with food. Working for the man. Huh?
Squidward	Let's do this thing.
Squidward	I never heard of a marching quintet.
Squidward	"Some people started calling it the ""SpongeBob Patty!"""
Squidward	Haunted, eh?
Squidward	Customers said to make them good like they used to be.
Squidward	G'night, boss! See you in the morning!
Squidward	Oh, no people are ever coming back here. Hey... no people. That's great! Because... I hate people!  I hate people! People hate me! I prefer my own best company! Single and secluded on my own! I can have the best of times all alone because I hate people!
Squidward	And...uh...oh...
Squidward	It's not a sea spider, you dope! It's... my hair!
Squidward	Well, you're not gonna do any damage with soft pillows!  Here, try this.
Squidward	Hi-ya!
Squidward	Ah! My baby!
Squidward	They're the ones asking...
Squidward	Oh, that was just a coincidence!
Squidward	Huh?  Hmm? Oh.
Squidward	Did you see that? I ran right through a brick wall. I'm hard as nails! Come on, world! Bring it on!
Squidward	Just watch. Enjoying your sherbet, Herbert?
Squidward	Funny, didn't feel a thing.
Squidward	Because now I've got moxie!
Squidward	No, no, no, no, no!
Squidward	It had to be this.
Squidward	And now... for some soothing sounds from Squidward's clarinet. Thank you, thank you.
Squidward	Oh, please! I mean, who in the world would pay to blow bubbles?
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	Ah, whoa, what?  Oh... who-who would pay 25 cents to blow bubbles?
Squidward	I really did it, didn't I? Hey, you guys didn't blow anything like that!
Squidward	Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I rock.
Squidward	SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?
Squidward	Why do you wanna eat this stuff anyway?!
Squidward	But Mr. Krabs, I still need help!
Squidward	Forget the stupid comic! We've got a situation here! We don't have any Krabby Patties, and these animals are trying to eat us instead!  Hey, who's responsible for this?
Squidward	Let's look at Gemini, sign of the twins. If you're a Gemini, you've probably experienced deja vu, a feeling that this moment has happened before. This month, Gemini's moon is in Uranus, so, you smell funny. Vibration for Gemini, you'll experience deja vu.  Meaning that this moment has happened before. I'm Squidward, your Nicktoon astrologer, reminding you not to touch my stuff.
Squidward	Today, we explore Sagittarius. Sign of the uh... half-horse, half-guy with a bow and arrow. The good thing about Sagitarians: they have great aim. The bad thing about them: they poop while they're walking. So never march behind them in a parade. My prediction for Sagittarius in the coming year: you won't eat enough green vegetables. I'm Squidward, your Nicktoon astrologer reminding you that if you smelt it, chances are, you dealt it.
Squidward	Six jamming jellies!  Ow!!
Squidward	Oh, gee, SpongeBob, that's a great idea. And maybe I should cook the patties and do the dishes and wear square pants and live in a pineapple while you wait in the unemployment line!
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	I think my heart just stopped.  It's Sponge...  ...Bob's fault!
Squidward	I will ring the bell when there's an order. But...  ...there's no customers! There hasn't been one all day and there isn't gonna be any!
Squidward	You get to run the cash register.
Squidward	I've got some very important boss-like errands to run. See ya later.
Squidward	Well, Squidward, you've really outdone yourself this time. A beautiful day of relaxing and pampering... With pay. Hmm... I guess I do kinda feel bad for poor little SpongeBob, all by his lonesome... Oh, oh, it'll pass. He's probably just standing at the register with that stupid grin on his face.
Squidward	Alright, goodbye.  This is great. My day off, no worries, just relaxation.  I'm the boss, I deserve this. Ah...
Squidward	It's me, you dunce!
Squidward	Just do your jobs!
Squidward	No!  That's it. That's it. No matter what sick fantasies run through my mind, I will not go back to that restaurant!
Squidward	There!  Now I'll have to stay here and enjoy myself!  I'm not even gonna think about you-know-who at the you-know-what doing I-don't-care.  Just gonna... Relax.  Let Squid's day off... begin.   What was that?  It's SpongeBob. He's spying on me, to see if I'm really doing errands.  But, but he left his post.  And I've finally caught him messing up.  Aha! I caught you, Sponge...  ... Branch.  Heh, here's that rubber duck Mr. Krabs wanted me to get.  I've got you now! Wait'll Mr. Krabs finds out you're a...  ... Toilet. You're losin' it, Squidward. Calm down. If I let this get to me again, I'll just end up running down to the Krusty Krab, bursting through the front door, up to that yellow headache SpongeBob, and he'll say...
Squidward	SpongeBob, you can't beat me!  Aha! I caught you now! You didn't think I knew you were a stick outside my window! Ha!  Or the toilet in my bathroom! And then you were in my bathtub, and I... And-and you... And I... And then you... Swam... Down the drain and... Beat me... to the Krusty... Krab.
Squidward	What's gonna happen? Am I gonna blow up?
Squidward	That's right! And you know what I wish?
Squidward	I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
Squidward	I'm sure it'll turn up.
Squidward	Stop it, SpongeBob.
Squidward	Knock it off, SpongeBob!
Squidward	SpongeBob, do you realize what this means?
Squidward	Well, I like it so far.
Squidward	Well, I didn't think it was possible SpongeBob, but you look even more ridiculous than usual.
Squidward	For what, dare I ask?
Squidward	What? How'd you? When did you?
Squidward	Nooooo!
Squidward	Because they've been stuck in this traffic with nothing to do for hours.
Squidward	Guess who just quit?
Squidward	Ohhh...
Squidward	Yes.
Squidward	This bubble is your friend?  Well, he's handsome, I'll give him that. What'll it be?
Squidward	He's an inanimate object, his money's no good here!
Squidward	How about a glass of our finest shampoo?
Squidward	Oh, silly me. I got the diet shampoo. Here we go, one of everything for Bubble Buddy.
Squidward	What, is he allergic to bread, too?
Squidward	Bubble money.  At least he left a tip!
Squidward	Enough sea-horsing around, SpongeBob! Give us that bubble!
Squidward	Uh...hi?
Squidward	"""I  you..."""
Squidward	I'll buy the little twerp a gum ball.
Squidward	Hi, there. Those homemade pies sure look good.
Squidward	Well, if it'll get old man Mr. Krabs off my back.  Okay, here it is, Mr. Krabs, fresh from the oven. I'll be returning to my life now.
Squidward	It's not there.
Squidward	You've seen this before?
Squidward	Uh, SpongeBob?
Squidward	Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of?
Squidward	We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation.
Squidward	Which is...?
Squidward	Oh, yeah...
Squidward	Does it involve more dismemberment?
Squidward	Yeah.
Squidward	Four... three... two... one...
Squidward	Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to !
Squidward	No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces!
Squidward	Ouch.
Squidward	Aye aye, captain.  Two boxes of buns. Three pounds of patties.
Squidward	"Well... whatever you say, ""Mr. Krabs.""  Whoopee!"
Squidward	Um, Wormy?
Squidward	Get a load of the scary monster.  Monster.
Squidward	It's all in the wrist.
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	What do you want?
Squidward	A hundred and one dollars for a Krabby Patty?
Squidward	Too bad SpongeBob's not here to enjoy SpongeBob not being here.
Squidward	Chum Bucket?... Free?... Krabby Patty?... Plankton?... Giving?... With?
Squidward	It means you set up Mr. Krabs. You stole the crown so Neptune would freeze him and you could finally get your stubby little paws on the Krabby Patty formula.  It was you all along. But you made one fatal mistake. You messed with my paycheck. And I'm gonna report you to the highest authority in the land, King Neptune!
Squidward	I'm getting outta here!
Squidward	The customers are getting restless. They're asking for...  refunds.
Squidward	We get the rest of the day off?
Squidward	We're out of Krabby Patties right now!
Squidward	(gloats) You heard him!
Squidward	Yeah, I'm with you guys.
Squidward	The only way we're going up there is if some fairy godmother shows up and helps us breathe air.
Squidward	Not a lot of leg room in here.
Squidward	Well, I guess this is where that horrible smell was coming from.
Squidward	We're never gonna make it!
Squidward	Nice. So this is what teamwork gets you.
Squidward	That sound must mean things are back to normal.
Squidward	Bow-tie French fries?
Squidward	I love bursting your bubble, SpongeBob, but they're laughing at you, not with you.
Squidward	Yeah, your grandma!
Squidward	What next?
Squidward	Playing with a reef blower? That is the most childish thing I have ever heard of.
Squidward	Put my windows back!
Squidward	No! No!
Squidward	No. I mean, yes. There's nobody with me. Yes, peace and quiet.
Squidward	Oh, which way to the Living-without-a-brain seminar? Don't be late.
Squidward	304 New Life street, Squidward speaking.  There is no way I am moving back there, SpongeBob. I am finally among my own kind.  Now goodbye!
Squidward	But it's fun!
Squidward	Stand back! I've got gardening tools!
Squidward	Hey, you're right!  And I'm leaving ASAP!
Squidward	How about a break?! We've been at it for days!
Squidward	I can't believe anybody would celebrate a holiday where a jolly prowler breaks into your house and leaves gifts.
Squidward	SpongeBob, grow up will ya? No one's going to give me a gift just because I write them a stupid letter.
Squidward	Sounds like someone felled my old coral tree! SpongeBob, Patrick, why'd you do this to me!?
Squidward	What do you want? Can't you see that I'm busy!?
Squidward	SpongeBob, forget it.
Squidward	SpongeBob, how many times do I have to say it? I don't believe in Santa Claus!
Squidward	Those idiots are gonna be up all night while I get a full nights sleep.
Squidward	What? What's this?
Squidward	Poor little guy. All he wanted was to spread a little joy.
Squidward	Up here you dunce.  I mean, uh, Merry Christmas little boy.
Squidward	SpongeBob? SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!
Squidward	Uhh, I loaned them to the Easter bunny.
Squidward	Merry Christmas, SpongeBob. Merry Christmas! Whew! I'm glad that's over.
Squidward	That almost felt good.  I didn't... who?
Squidward	What was I thinking? I gave away all my stuff just 'cause SpongeBob wouldn't be sad. Am I insane?  You might as well take the door. It's all that's left.
Squidward	Hm.
Squidward	Right. But I can't. Bye bye.
Squidward	Ow.
Squidward	Not on your life, sport.
Squidward	Do we have to wear pickle jars?
Squidward	: This is pretty easy.
Squidward	You know the guy who did it?
Squidward	That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away!
Squidward	Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
Squidward	I...no, I don't.
Squidward	Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's...
Squidward	Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting!  Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea...  Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me...  Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act?
Squidward	Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time, understand?!
Squidward	I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
Squidward	Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?
Squidward	Squidward, if you had some hair, you'd be the most gorgeous creature in the sea! You've got looks... talent... all you need is a full head of...  hair!
Squidward	Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Squidward	Come on, SpongeBob!
Squidward	Okay, give it to me.  Come on SpongeBob, stop it!
Squidward	Mediocre?
Squidward	Sometimes. Uh, how's the unibrow?
Squidward	Hold it! It just so happens that I  sell fast food, I  have a band, and we're gonna play that Bubble Bowl! How do you like that, Fancy Boy?!
Squidward	People, people, settle down! Ok, now. How many of you have played musical instruments before?
Squidward	Ok, try to repeat after me.  Brass section, go.  Good. Now the wind.  And the drums.  Too bad that didn't kill me.  Let's just try stepping in the rhythm. Now I want everyone to stand in straight rows of five.
Squidward	How's that harmonica solo coming Plankton?
Squidward	Wait, wait. I know tensions are high...  There's a deposit on that equipment, people!  Settle down, please!
Squidward	Uh, they couldn't come. They... died.
Squidward	Well, I guess this will be the last time I can show my face in this town.
Squidward	Read the sign.
Squidward	Mr. Krabs..
Squidward	Here. Please hit me as hard as you can.
Squidward	That's where the dumpster is, yes.
Squidward	Well I am. Especially after,  well, you know.
Squidward	"You mean you've never heard the story of the  ""Hash-Slinging Slasher?"""
Squidward	Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties ...it happened.
Squidward	NO! He cut off his own hand by mistake.
Squidward	And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?
Squidward	There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First, the lights will flicker on and off. Next...
Squidward	You really want to know?
Squidward	It's not true! None of it's true!
Squidward	Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here!  Very funny, SpongeBob.
Squidward	Nice try, what?
Squidward	The SASH-RINGING, FLASH-SINGING, THE BASH-PINGING...
Squidward	SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!
Squidward	Oh, no, not a penny. Help, somebody help us.
Squidward	He means this filth, you loon.
Squidward	Don't you mean there are only 7?
Squidward	SpongeBob? In art class? Wait! This is cooking! Come back! You gotta be kidding.
Squidward	So, you wanna be an artist, eh, SpongeBob?
Squidward	If I'm lucky, some of Mr. Tentacles talent will rub off on me.
Squidward	Gimme that.  Forget the circles.
Squidward	Alright, SpongeBob, pay close attention. Look at your marble. Visualize the sculpture within. And...
Squidward	The world famous art collector?
Squidward	Why not?
Squidward	Fame.
Squidward	I could use a little help.  My fame, my fortune, my hair.
Squidward	Hey, cheer up. I have decided to give you another chance. Why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible.
Squidward	Really!
Squidward	Gimme that.  Ok, SpongeBob. Just do what you did before.
Squidward	Uhh...  How about this, huh? Remember?
Squidward	Now you've got it.
Squidward	Uhh...
Squidward	As of now, it's his responsibility.  Good day to you, sir.
Squidward	You hardly pay us at all!
Squidward	Uh, SpongeBob? What do you think you're doing?
Squidward	Sure! After all, you like your job, right?
Squidward	Then let's go on strike!
Squidward	He owes us for all the precious, irretrievable moments we've wasted in this trash heap.
Squidward	Just do exactly as I say, SpongeBob, and in no time you'll have your job back and more.
Squidward	SpongeBob, you're pathetic. Look, I threw my hat to the ground.
Squidward	...No.  This is a picket sign: Krusty Krab Unfair. Short, sweet, and to the point.
Squidward	I've got something for you to do. Go stand over there.
Squidward	With your support, we will send the hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs'
Squidward	On strike with SpongeBob... forever?
Squidward	Your story breaks my heart, Mr. Krabs. Why don't we take a little walk and, uh... discuss my terms.
Squidward	Wow. Squidward, this is the best souffl you have ever created. Congratulations, chef!
Squidward	Yeah, Patrick, we're friends...  just friends.
Squidward	Ow! My back! I threw out my back!
Squidward	No, no! Get away from me! No, no!
Squidward	You play?
Squidward	Patrick! Get out! And put some clothes on!
Squidward	Come on in! You look stunning.
Squidward	Patrick! Your glass is full!
Squidward	NO! Out!
Squidward	SpongeBob, do you remember that little talk we had about 'personal space'?
Squidward	Then you must have coral wedged in your frontal lobe!
Squidward	What?
Squidward	Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!
Squidward	Shut your half-wit pieholes!  I do not now, nor will I ever, want to be a member of your stupid club!
Squidward	Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery? Why-y-y-y?!
Squidward	You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?
Squidward	All right, all right, all right! I don't need your help. I'm gonna find my way back to sanity!  But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns...  sad...  clowns.  What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost!  Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here!  Huh?  I'm  Take that, SpongeBob and Patrick!  Huh? Ohhh...  there's no way out of here.  How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight?  Ah...  Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days.  How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any.  And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell!  If you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam...  that tells you nothing! As if the answers to solve all your problems will fall right out of the sky!  Fall right out of the sky!
Squidward	Umm...uh..yeah?
Squidward	Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic.  Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?
Squidward	No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!
Squidward	Can I have something to eat?
Squidward	I'm   You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!
Squidward	Huh?
Squidward	Don't say anything Squidward, remember your karma.
Squidward	SpongeBob, there's no ghosts!
Squidward	Just get my order.
Squidward	Why don't you ask CowBob RanchPants and his faithful companion Sir Eats-A-Lot?
Squidward	Hey, Mr. Krabs, looks like old Mystery had an after-dinner salad!
Squidward	You forgot your mayonnaise.
Squidward	Yeah, well, not me.
Squidward	I've never had a Krabby Patty and never will.
Squidward	Get that garbage outta my face!
Squidward	No!
Squidward	Ggood for you?! That thing is a heart attack on a bun!
Squidward	No.
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Listen, SpongeBob, how long are you prepared to keep this up?  Give me that! When I die...you stay away from my funeral.  Ohh... do I really...
Squidward	Nobody but me.
Squidward	Come on! Come on! Come on!  Ah... still alive!  Oh, soooo delicious!  Oh...! All the wasted years...!  I gotta have more. I gotta have !  But wait!  After that performance, he'd never let me live it down! I gotta sneak one. Just one, then... I'm off the stuff for !
Squidward	Don't go...
Squidward	I had to say garbage... but, okay!
Squidward	SpongeBob? Uh, uh, uh... what are you doing here?
Squidward	I... I... I... no, I didn't do...
Squidward	What's gonna happen? Am I gonna blow up?
Squidward	That's a big box!
Squidward	Uh-huh, that's quite a plan there. Oh, but wait, there was something else I wanted to ask you two. Now what was it? Oh, yeah, yeah.  Don't you two have any brains?!
Squidward	Okay, let's see. I'm imaging myself watching TV...  ...and there it is! Can I have it, SpongeBob?
Squidward	Now where's that remote?
Squidward	[confused] What the? How were you two making that noise?
Squidward	Grrrr... Aha!  How are you two doing that?
Squidward	I'll show them!  There's got to be one in here!  Ah! This hat box should do nicely.  Why haven't I worn this yet?
Squidward	Isn't there anything on that isn't about BOXES?!
Squidward	Laugh at me, will they?  All right, where is it?
Squidward	All right, make way you two, I'm coming in.
Squidward	Why won't this thing turn on?!  All right, fine. If you don't want to show me,  I don't care! I've got better things to do than pace the floor wondering how you two work this thing.  How do those two work that thing? There's got to be a secret button or a switch or something! I mean, listen to that!  Now, that sounds like Robot Pirate Island! Think, Squidward, think! I got it: when those two go to bed, I'll sneak in there and find that button! I'll wait all night if I have to!
Squidward	Can I help you?
Squidward	This is a restaurant, not a lending library. And who are you calling big nose, big nose?
Squidward	SpongeBob, what's going on in here? Huh?  Why's everything all tiny?
Squidward	You've got something alright, let's see it!
Squidward	He didn't lend it to you, did he?
Squidward	Uh Oh!  There's the phone.
Squidward	And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for.
Squidward	SpongeBob, if you don't return me to normal size right now, you are gonna be in really big trouble!
Squidward	Stop! I've got an idea. Let's call Mermaid Man and-
Squidward	Hey! Now will you take us to Mermaid Man?!
Squidward	I guess this is okay.
Squidward	Ah, yes. Warm fire, cozy slippers, and a piping hot cup of tea with a lemon wedge.  Why do I even bother?  Would you two please keep it down?!
Squidward	Fascinating.  Now, where was I?  What?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Look, SpongeBob, I was just...  SpongeBob! Oh...
Squidward	Hmm...
Squidward	Look, you two are giving up too easily. Now, Patrick, pretend I'm SpongeBob.
Squidward	Would you butt out?!
Squidward	I don't have one, okay? Now...
Squidward	Trust me, it's fine.
Squidward	No-no... no, wait, wait, wait!  I was just giving a demonstration!  All right, that's it! You guys asked for it!  I got him! Ha! I got him!  In your face, SpongeBob!  This was actually kind of... exciting! Why... I've never felt so alive!
Squidward	What a baby.
Squidward	This is all necessary.
Squidward	This job gets very stressful, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward	What's your problem, Amy?
Squidward	To my tailfin?
Squidward	Enter-what?
Squidward	29, 30, 31...
Squidward	Teacher's pet.
Squidward	Of course I'm...what are you saying?
Squidward	I didn't take your precious dime!
Squidward	Not anymore, Mr. Krabs. I quit!
Squidward	Being dead, or anything else!
Squidward	SpongeBob, I don't need your help. I am ready to unlock my potential. I could be anything I set my mind to.  I could be a football player, or a king, or a spaceman.
Squidward	SpongeBob?
Squidward	No.
Squidward	Nobody would take them. So I had to eat them.
Squidward	It's really nice of you to help me in my time of need. I'll try not to be a burden.
Squidward	SpongeBob, could I get some more blankets.
Squidward	SpongeBob?! SpongeBob?!  And why aren't you in uniform?  It's about time you got here!
Squidward	That lemon has 3 seeds in it. That's an odd number! I can't eat anything odd numbered.
Squidward	I've changed my mind. I want soup instead.
Squidward	4 o'clock. Time for my stories. Hurry up, they won't hold the show while you laze around.
Squidward	Well, it's kind of good to be back, sir.
Squidward	Are you accusing me of something?
Squidward	Yes... I mean no... I mean... uhh, uhh... Hey, whatcha been up to?
Squidward	Don't lie. Lying always makes it worse.  I own a five-star restaurant!
Squidward	Please, Mr. Krabs, you got to help me! When they get here tonight, they're going to see I'm just a big phony and a loser!
Squidward	Don't rub it in.
Squidward	Alright, I've heard enough. You've got the job.  Mr. Krabs, didn't you once serve on the S.S. Gourmet?
Squidward	It's the guy who goes to tables and takes orders.
Squidward	He's just the hat-check guy, nothing essential!  What happened? What is it?
Squidward	There you are! SpongeBob, you gotta help me!  Patrick and Mr. Krabs aren't working out, and Squilliam's almost here, and, and... SpongeBob?
Squidward	Empty your mind.
Squidward	Wait, Squilliam, I've got to explain!
Squidward	Pinch me, I must be dreaming.  Ow!
Squidward	In that case, I need you to read this.
Squidward	Heh. Stop joking. Tell him your name.
Squidward	Okay, I admit it, I'm a fraud! This was all a futile, pathetic attempt to impress you. This isn't really my restaurant. I'm just a cashier!
Squidward	SpongeBob!
Squidward	That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen?
Squidward	Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie?
Squidward	SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much!
Squidward	Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?
Squidward	SpongeBob.
Squidward	I never thought I'd say this, but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop! How To Torture
Squidward	SpongeBob, are you okay?
Squidward	SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first.
Squidward	Where's Mr. Krabs?
Squidward	SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender.
Squidward	Where's Mr. Krabs?  Not talking, eh?
Squidward	SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?
Squidward	Just clock out already!
Squidward	Laugh it up! My knowledge and intelligence could make even the Chum Bucket a success!
Squidward	I'll do it.
Squidward	Oh, I'm sorry! Remind me, who's in complete creative control here?
Squidward	See, Plankton, there's a trick to making chum edible. We just have to follow old Grandma Tentacles's secret fricassee recipe.
Squidward	A star.
Squidward	What are you blockheads up to? Don't you know it's after midnight? Get down here!
Squidward	Gotcha!
Squidward	SpongeBob, how about more Krabby Pattiesand less heavy breathing?
